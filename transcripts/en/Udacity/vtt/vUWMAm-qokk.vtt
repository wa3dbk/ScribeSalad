00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
In summary, partnering strategies are great.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.920
But understand you're not a peer of these large companies.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.860
And all the books and literature that talks about partnerships

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.810
very rarely addresses startup to large company partnerships.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.080
These are asymmetrical relationships.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.400
And so don't confuse partners that you need early on to address earlyvangelists

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.180
with the ones that you might need a year or 2 from now to address mainstream customers.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.560
So remember, if you've been getting out of the building,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.120
you actually found the early passionate customer segments

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.940
or people inside those segments that will buy your product

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.820
even unfinished or unbuilt or buggy as it is.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.410
Understand what they need now and help them teach you what the mainstream will need later.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.320
And so don't confuse big company partnering with startup strategy.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.860
Find the partners that give you an unfair advantage.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.290
And just keep in mind--and this really requires a bit of cynicism--

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.720
that you really don't matter to a large partner.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.000
They matter enormously to you, but I would keep a jaded eye out

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.410
and understand what's in it for you to build your company

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.280
so that one day you're bigger than them.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.180
One of the other advantages about talking to partners to keep in mind

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.900
is this is almost like dating.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.420
While you're out there talking to them, understanding what resources,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.920
what activities they could provide or what supply chain they could fulfill for you,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.090
also understand that some of them might be your potential acquirer someday.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.200
And so even if the relationships don't work out or the deals don't work out,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.590
always be on your best behavior.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.780
Always in fact make them wish, "Boy, this would be a great part of our company,"

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.510
because right now you might not want to be acquired,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.660
but someday someone might want to come back when you're bigger

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.860
with an offer that you just couldn't refuse,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.100
and you get to buy the house and the car and the airplane at the south of France,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.730
and remember how great you were in those partnership discussions.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.720
So partnerships can be strategic, they could be fun, they could be nerve-racking.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.870
Understand they're an integral part of your business model and business model canvas.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.800
Go out and talk to a ton of them.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.870
And when you do, you'll understand how to use them

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.000
to make your startup into a large company.
