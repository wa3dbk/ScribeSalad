Here is my hand and as I draw my fingers, I find that I have 5 fingers on my hand.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Please check your hands, I bet in all likelihood, each of your hands has 5 fingers, but not always.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So if we go and measure the number of fingers that people have on the left hand, you'll probably find

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that almost everybody has 5 fingers, and in all honesty, there is the rare case of a person

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
who has fewer fingers, like 4 or 3, but that's really rare.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So if we look at that sequence, we have 20 hands, 19 of which have 5 fingers.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So what do you think now is the average number of fingers for this specific data sequence.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Please enter your answer here.

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
