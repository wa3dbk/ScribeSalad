00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.260
Now Sarah has just shown you how one can use object tracing to find a bug in a

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.430
method implementation. And I'd like to show you another kind of bug that's

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.940
fairly common. So over here I have my drive method. I drive a given distance, I

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.280
update the miles driven. I compute the gas consumed. I update the gasInTank.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.050
And when I compile it, I get an error message. Where it says can not find

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.490
symbol variable gas consumed. It's complaining over here. Now it's a common

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.990
error to now say oh, it can't find it so let me just make another instance

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:43.330
variable. So on the surface it doesn't seem like an error because the class

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.200
will compile and actually the code will kind of work but it's really inelegant.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.140
Let's use the tracing technique to find out why. Note that this class now has

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.900
four instance variables. Here they are on an index card. And now let's quickly

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.140
run through the same scenario that we had previously. The car gets constructed,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.360
we add 30 gallons, we drive 10 miles. That consumes a gallon. We then drive 20

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.850
miles for a total of 30, that consumes 2 gallons. We're left with 27 gallons.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.055
So what's wrong? Have a look at this variable. The stuff that it remembers is

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:22.250
short-term information. The amount of gas consumed the last time we drove,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.230
that's just like remembering what pizza you had for lunch. You don't really

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.880
need to remember this long term. There's absolutely no need to remember these

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.280
values after a call to drive, they should be short term memory that should be a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.780
local variable. Okay, let's make it so. Over here let's not make gas consumed

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.800
into an instance variable. Over here we turn it into a local variable simply by

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.160
adding the type. Remember the difference between an assignment and a variable

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.450
declaration is nothing but the type. Now the code will compile. And when we

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.350
review the instance variables up here, we'll find there are no unnecessary one.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.990
Your car does need to remember the miles driven at a gas level across multiple

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.449
method calls. And of course, it needs to know the mileage so that it can

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.750
compute the gas consumption. So you've just seen how the technique of object

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.525
tracing gives us an insight into what an object does and it let's us find some

00:02:16.525 --> 00:02:18.511
errors.
