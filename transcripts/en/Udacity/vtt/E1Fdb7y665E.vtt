00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.530
So the keyword this makes it possible for it to build just one

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.000
function object and use that as a method on a bunch of other objects.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.560
And every time we call the method,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.140
it'll have access to whatever object it's being called on.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.880
This can be really useful for conserving memory,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.060
and it's only possible because we have access to the parameter this.
