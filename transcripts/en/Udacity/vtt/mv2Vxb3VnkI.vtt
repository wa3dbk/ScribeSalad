00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.230
So let's define the global and
local hit rate.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.760
The global hit rate can be defined as
simply 1 minus the global miss rate.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.020
And the global miss rate can be defined
as the number of misses in this cache,

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.840
divided by the number of all memory
references that the processor makes,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.710
not just those that reach this cache.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.630
In contrast, the local hit rate and
the local miss rate can be defined in

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.246
terms of normal cache
behavior local to this cache.

00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:33.888
So then local hit rate, for example,

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:38.688
is the number of hits divided by
the number of accesses to this cache.

00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:41.490
And remember that not all
of the memory references

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.530
a processor makes actually
reach this cache.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.780
The local miss rate simply can be the
number of misses divided by the number

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.060
of accesses and they,
of course, still add up to 1.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.230
Another popular metric of how
often the cache hits that tries

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.000
to capture the behavior of caches that
are not the level 1 cache, is misses

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.360
per 1000 instructions, or MPKI,
where K stands for kilo instructions.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.440
It is very similar to the global
miss rate, except that

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.280
it doesn't normalize the misses with
the number of just memory accesses.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.950
It normalizes with
the number of instructions.
