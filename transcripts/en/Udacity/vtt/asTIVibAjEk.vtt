00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now I'm going to take quick look at the question what is testing. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So it's always the case that we have some software under test.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
When we're doing testing, we always require a source of test inputs. This results in test outputs.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The outputs are processed by an acceptability check.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If the outputs are okay, then the test case succeeded.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If the outputs are not okay, then the test case failed and we're going to have to debug.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is, of course, really simple.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
On the other hand, a couple of the things on this slide here--that is selecting a good set of test inputs,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and designing good acceptability test--end up being actually really hard,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and basically, these are what we are going to be spending this course talking about.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I would like to give a few facts about testing--by facts of course I mean my own opinions.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
First of all, the goal of testing isn't so much as finding bugs,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but rather it's finding bugs as early as possible.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If our goal is just to find some bugs, we go ahead and give the software to our customers

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and let them find the bugs, but of course, there are huge cost associated with doing this.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What we rather want to do is to move the time in which to find those bugs early.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And the fundamental reason for that is, is that it's almost always the case

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that the bug that's found earlier is cheaper to fix.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The second fact is that it's possible to spend a lot of time and effort

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
on testing and still do a really bad job.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Doing testing right requires some imagination and some good taste.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Third, more testing is not always better.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In fact, the quality of testing is all about the cost/benefit tradeoff.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And fundamentally, testing is an economic activity. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We're spending money or we're spending effort on testing

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in order to save ourselves money and effort later.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Going along with this, testing methods should be evaluated about the cost per defect found.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Fourth, testing can be made much easier by designing software to be testable.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We have a quite a bit more to say about that later. Fifth, quality cannot be tested into software.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And the corollary of that is--it is surprisingly easy to create software

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but it's impossible to test effectively at all.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Finally, this is an important one, testing your own software is really hard and there are several reasons

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
for this--first of all, it's pretty common for us as developers to be proud of our work.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
What that means is we may not really want our own software to fail.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
This isn't sort of blaming developers--it's rather just a fundamental fact of human nature.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We're trying to shape software, we're trying to make good software, and we may fundamentally 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
at some sort of subconscious level not really want to break it that badly.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The second reason that testing our own software is hard is that as an individual developer,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
we tend to get our heads buried in the details.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And we may not know the global context that would allows us to do really effective testing

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
of the software that we just wrote.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The third reason is we can't test the code that we left out

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
because we didn't understand that it needed to be written.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Finally, we can't write effective test cases for parts of the spec that we didn't understand correctly.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So it's not uncommon of all for us to misunderstand things while reading this verification.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
For example, to keep aside or get something, otherwise, backwards 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and once we've done something like that, what we really have is a bug in our thinking.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And it's mirrored by the bug in the software, but those kind of bugs are extremely hard for us to find.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
They rarely often takes somebody else testing it to find that kind of bug.
