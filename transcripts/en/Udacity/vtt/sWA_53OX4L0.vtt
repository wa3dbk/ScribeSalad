00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Take a bow--we are done parsing HTML!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
That was it; we've seen all of the relevant rules.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, I haven't actually shown you the detail for handling tag arguments,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but we'll get a chance to look into that later.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
For now, let's go on to JavaScript,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which is actually going to have very similar rules to HTML.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You may have already guessed that a lot of the options

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in JavaScript are very similar.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We have a large number of binary operators:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Plus, Minus, Times, Divide, Less Than, Greater Than--

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and it turns out that there is a very convenient notation

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when we're programming grammars, for getting those all in.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Rather than having to make a separate little parsing function--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or parsing rule--for each one,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I can just write out multiple related parsing rules in the same string,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and give one piece of code that applies uniformly to all of them.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So we said before that this colon

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
kind of meant the arrow.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This vertical bar--it's as if we had written

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
this same nonterminal (exp) one more time,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and then another arrow:

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
expression goes to expression times expression.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This is just a concise notation for your benefit,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so that we don't have to type out as much.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And here, I'm showing how to make a abstract syntax tree,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which, again, for us is just nested tuples

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
for a JavaScript binary operator.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And, in reality, we'd want to add in another rule for Divide,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Less Than, Greater Than--

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
we might have ten of these at the end of the day.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But it turns out that our old friend, Ambiguity, is going to rear its head.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If my input is: (1 - 3 - 5)

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
there are actually two ways we might interpret that--

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
or two parse trees we might end up with--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and, depending on which one we pick, we get a slightly different answer.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This could mean: (1 - 3) - 5,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
at which point, we'll get (-7).

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Or it could mean: 1- (3 - 5), at which point, we'll get (3).

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We say that this first option is what is known as

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Left Associative

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
because it puts the parentheses on the Left

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
or the tree ends up being sort of unbalanced towards the Left.

00:01:59.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Similarly, this second option is Right Associative.
