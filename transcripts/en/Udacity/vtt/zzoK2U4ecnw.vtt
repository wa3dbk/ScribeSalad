00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.058
Let me show you what I did. I removed this line. I added a parameter, then I

00:00:04.058 --> 00:00:10.872
used the parameter here. And am I done here? not quite. I still have to

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:16.426
document the parameter. Pat yourself on the back if you did that. Now, onto the

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:21.658
main method. Here, I want to read the input. So, I declare a scanner and I use

00:00:21.658 --> 00:00:25.370
it to read the added redness over here, I'd pass that value through the redden

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.643
method. Now, there's a couple of things that I soon need to do. First off, the

00:00:31.643 --> 00:00:39.631
prompt, here it is, notice print not print on and the extra space. And finally,

00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:44.630
up here. I need the import statement. Now, we're ready to go. When running the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.410
program, I'm prompted for the added redness. I'm going to go and crank it way

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.670
up here. And, woah, that's pretty red. Now, the benefit of having the input

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.576
provided by the user, is I can now experiment with other values, I simply run

00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:07.650
the program again. And just to see if it works, I'll supply a negative number.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.131
And as you can see, now the image got a little bluer, greener, whatever, less

00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:16.670
red. Now, you know how to read user input in Java.
