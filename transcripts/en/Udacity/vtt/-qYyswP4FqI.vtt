00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.476
Congratulations, you have completed unit 5.

00:00:02.476 --> 00:00:05.407
You have a search engine that can respond to queries quickly,

00:00:05.407 --> 00:00:08.260
no matter how large the index gets.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.839
This problem of analyzing the cost of algorithms

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.142
and designing data structures that are more efficient,

00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:15.659
is one of the core ideas in all of computer science.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.228
It's something we go into a lot more depth on in later courses

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:21.160
that I hope you will take after finishing CS101,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.861
including the Algorithms and Theory of Computation course.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.947
The main thing we have left to do for our search engine,

00:00:27.947 --> 00:00:32.441
is to find a way to get the best page for a given query, instead of all pages.

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:34.524
This is the main thing that made Google so successful -

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:36.591
figuring out a better way to identify the pages

00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:38.493
searchers really care about.

00:00:38.493 --> 00:00:40.477
Thats what we are going to look at in unit 6.

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:43.000
Hope to see you back soon!
