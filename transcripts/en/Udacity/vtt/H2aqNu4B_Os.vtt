00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.840
Before doing that, though, now that we discuss the different kinds

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.510
of relationships among classes in the class diagram. I would like

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.230
to ask you to look at a list of relationships that

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.920
I'm providing here and mark the relationships that you think actually

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.120
hold for the classes in the system that we are modeling.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.260
So here I have a list of possible relationships for each

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.070
relationship. I'm first defining what the relationship is and then what

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.270
kind of relationship that is, for example, for the first one I'm

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.500
saying that the registration manager uses

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.090
the scheduling algorithm, which is a dependency

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.860
relationship. And similarly for the other ones. So like for you to go back

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.070
to the example, look at the classes that we defined, think about the

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.360
requirements, and identify which ones of this

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.610
relationships you think hold in the system.
