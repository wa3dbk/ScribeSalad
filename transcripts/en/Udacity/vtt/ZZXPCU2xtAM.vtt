00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.740
In code, to create a camera position,
you use a CameraPosition.builder.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.470
This builder takes the properties that
you've just seen, such as the target,

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.390
which is the latitude and longitude.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.050
The zoom that you want, how far you
want to be zoomed into the map.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.100
The baring of the camera,
the direction that it's pointing in and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.970
the tilt of the camera.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.030
When you've set all of these
properties and you build it,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.760
you'll then get a camera position and
I've just called it cp here.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.870
Then if you want to instantaneously
update the map to show the location that

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.920
the camera is pointing at with these
values, you call map.movecamera and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.150
you pass it, a camera update
factory.newcameraposition

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.660
with that camera position
that you've just defined.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.620
Like I said, this will instantaneously
move the map to that location.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.630
But you may also want to animate
the map to that position

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.820
where you'll see a flyover type effect
where you'll fly to the new location.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.850
And to do this,
you'll use animateCamera.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.241
And animateCamera takes the same
CameraUpdateFactory.newCameraPosition

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:02.030
ith your camera position, but it also
has a couple of extra parameters.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.820
One is the time in milliseconds
that you wanted to take to fly to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.300
the new location.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.560
Of course you might want to zip
over there really quickly or

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.860
you might want to slow pan up over
the Earth and down to the new location.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.230
You'd specify the time
in milliseconds here.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.090
So if you wanted to take five seconds,
you'd put 5,000 milliseconds in here.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.150
And the callback function gets called
when the animation is complete.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.910
So if you want to execute some
code once the animation is done,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.960
you could put it in
that callback function.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.570
If you don't want to use a callback
function, you can just put a null here.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.830
Let's take a look at
an animated camera in action.
