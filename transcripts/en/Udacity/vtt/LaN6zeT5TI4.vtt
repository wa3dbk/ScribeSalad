00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.296
One possible answer is this equation. We're going to square this leg of the

00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:09.740
triangle. Add it to the square of this leg of the triangle. Which is equal to d

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.899
squared, hypotenuse. This is really just the Pythagorean theorem. We have a

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:20.880
number squared. Plus another number squared. Equals they hypotenuse squared.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.530
And what we could do is take the square root of both sides of the equation.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.630
This would leave us with d equal to the square root of x2 minus x1 squared,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.070
plus y2 minus y1 squared. Great thinking if you got either of the equations.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.334
Now, the order of these variables doesn't actually matter, since we're squaring

00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:43.587
the numbers. If we wound up with a negative value here, it would become

00:00:43.587 --> 00:00:48.698
positive, since we're squaring it. The same is true for the y value. If this

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:52.718
value is negative, and we squared it, it would wind up being positive. So,

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:56.942
perhaps an easier way to think about it, is just, think about the change in the

00:00:56.942 --> 00:01:02.180
x and the change in the y. How far did we travel this way, and how far did we

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.739
travel this way. We'll square both of those, take their sum, and then take the

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:11.865
square root to find the distance. This symbol right here that you see here is

00:01:11.865 --> 00:01:15.770
delta and itâ€™s a Greek letter that means change. You may have seen this in

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.460
chemistry or in other courses. And this delta just means change. I think itâ€™s

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.356
easy to think about the change in the x values. And the change in the y values

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:29.832
to find our answer. This is more simple than writing this crazy notation.

00:01:29.832 --> 00:01:33.528
Memorizing the formula is not so important as really understanding that we're

00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:37.000
setting up a right triangle in space, when we find the distance between two

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.910
points. That can always help you problem solve.
