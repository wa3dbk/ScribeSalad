00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.080
So let's outline what we want to do and
in the next segment we'll execute it.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.410
We'll need to make our first request
to see how many results we get,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.900
then parse the JSON that returns,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.030
then determine how many pages
of results that ends up being.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.860
We can then generate a random
number in that range

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.650
then use that number to make
a second request for a random page.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.810
And finally,
repeat what we did previously and

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.920
get a random photo from that
random page of results.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.640
In this chart, the steps are defined
in a way that suggests that each step

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.950
happens one after
the other without delay.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.210
But remember, when we're working
with networking requests,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.710
the requests don't complete immediately.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.560
That's why we use a completion handler
to define what we want to happen

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.590
once a network request finishes.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.310
It's like saying, I don't know when
the request will complete, but

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.450
run this code when it does.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.860
Another added benefit is that while
the network request is being processed,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.730
our app can continue running.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.340
We describe this kind of request as
an asynchronous request, or asynchronous

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.850
task, because it gives us the ability
to define the behavior we want and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.920
to defer its execution until
after something happens.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.210
In this case,
after the request completes.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.090
You can think of an asynchronous request
like putting a cake in an oven and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.970
setting a timer to indicate when
the cake will finish baking.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.940
While the cake is baking we can go do
other things like make frosting, but

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.610
as soon as the timer goes off, we need
to pull the cake out of the oven.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.710
Pulling the cake out of the oven
is like our completion handler,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.500
it's what we do as soon
as the timer goes off.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.340
In the same way,
we want to make the second request only

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.550
after the first request finishes and
we've gotten a random page number.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.630
In the second request we'll
define another completion handler

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.490
to handle getting a random photo
from the random page of results.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.840
So you can see how to
achieve this flow of steps,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.450
we're chaining together
asynchronous requests.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.040
When one request finishes,
we'll move on to the next and so forth.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.700
This kind of chaining of asynchronous
network tasks is a common occurrence and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.150
there's some popular frameworks
out there for dealing with this.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.260
We won't go into detail about
them in this course though but

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.760
