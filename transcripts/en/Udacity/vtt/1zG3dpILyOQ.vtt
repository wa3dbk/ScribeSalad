With this kind of star network in particular, 
the datastructure that you need to set up is

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.010
actually quite simple. We need to be able to compute 
the distance between any pair of nodes

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.949
called say a which is labelled here in the graph, and b labelled here in the graph

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.268
and they have to have lists of hubs such that

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:20.629
the uh... the hub has to be on a shortest path from a to b,
well all the paths from a to b

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:25.649
in fact all the paths between anything in the network have to pass through x

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.589
so as long as everybody has their distance to x

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.120
which is 1 if it's an unweighed network but there could be weights on these edges

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.230
as long as each node knows its distance to x 
we'll be able to intersect the lists

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.560
for any pair of nodes and know the total distance 
from node a to node b.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.530
uh... one little bit of trickiness there though is that

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.610
notice that x's list also has to have x on it

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.710
but that's ok. It can just have x with
a distance of zero so it can be its own hub

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.610
and then we still should be fine we'll
get the distance from a to x

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.210
which is whatever the distance from a
to x is plus zero so one is the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.890
answer I was looking for.
