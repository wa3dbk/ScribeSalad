00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.290
Let's have a closer look at constructing objects. This time we'll use a

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.350
different class. The class called rectangle. In BlueJ I right-click on the

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.680
class in order to construct objects. Now look closely here. Up here I have two

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.575
lines that start with the keyword new. Followed by the name of the class. The

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:26.010
keyword new is an instruction to make a new object of the class that's written

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.180
after new. Inside the parenthesis, we put the construction arguments. Now

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.180
notice that the're actually two of these. Two so called constructors. The first

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.170
one wants four construction arguments. The second one doesn't want any. Let's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.190
use the first one. Here we see the construction arguments described as x, y,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.320
width and the height. I'm filling in some values, five, ten, 60 and 90 and when

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.510
I click OK, the familiar object icon appears. Now as always in BlueJ, I can

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.840
right click on the object icon to find out what methods there are. For example,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.220
the get width method gives me the width and that's the 60 that I just supplied.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.740
You might be a little disappointed that the rectangle is not displayed but to

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.430
display, simply call it straw method. Right-click Draw and here it is in a

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.860
little window. Let's look at the second constructor, the one with no argument.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.165
When I select it, I don't need to supply any argument values and the object is

00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:42.767
constructed. What rectangle might it be? I can draw it. But nothing seems to

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:53.342
show up. Let's investigate. it has width zero. And height zero, not a very

00:01:53.342 --> 00:02:04.300
useful rectangle but of course I can always grow it. And there it is. At any

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.850
rate you have now seen that the rectangle class has two ways of constructing

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.570
objects. One constructure take four arguments, the other none. Let's have a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.530
look at it's Javadoc.
