00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.538
And the solutions are, f of x equals 2 x plus 3 corresponds with letter c. F of

00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:14.240
x equals x squared plus 6 corresponds with graph of the letter b. F of x equals

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.655
2 corresponds with f. F of x equals x cubed minus 1 corresponds with letter a,

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:28.534
and f of x equals the absolute value of x minus 2 corresponds with letter d.

00:00:28.534 --> 00:00:34.486
And finally, f of x equals the square root of 3x plus 2 corresponds with letter

00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:36.215
e.
