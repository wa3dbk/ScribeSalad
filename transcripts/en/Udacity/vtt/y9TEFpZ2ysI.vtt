00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.780
Well that's it for the four plus one views, but

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.780
I think there are some other views which are sometimes useful in understanding,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.830
or conveying your understanding,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.350
of a system that you're trying to build at the architectural level.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.140
One that I've found quite useful is a feature view.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.280
A feature is a conceptual unit of system behavior from the user's point of view.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.689
Your camera has a zooming feature available to it.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.150
Or maybe it doesn't, okay?

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.547
Typically, features are something which manufacturers provide as options,

00:00:38.547 --> 00:00:41.450
that you may have to pay extra for.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.740
Feature modeling is used for describing a set of features that

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.380
a a collection of related applications provide.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.800
There's feature diagram, which I'm going to show you in a second,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.580
that conveys the set of possible features that might be

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.220
configured into a particular product in that set of products.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.000
The diagram is graphical.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.150
It has icons and so on, but it can also have intra-feature constrains which

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.170
aren't shown in this particular diagram.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.160
Here's a particular feature diagram showing the features of a car.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.030
At the top is the, what's called the concept or the main

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.080
manufactured item and then under it are its features.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.860
So the car, this particular car has four features.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.360
Okay.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.360
Three of the features are required.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.730
The body, the transmission, and engine.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.740
And whether or not it pulls trailer is optional.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.460
Whether it's required or optional is indicated by the little circle at

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.860
the end of arc connecting cart to its features.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.490
If the circle is filled in it's a required feature, and

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.370
if it's open; then it's an optional feature.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.390
Features can have sub-features.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.060
So, a transition sorry, a transmission can have

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.150
an automatic transmission feature, or a manual transmission feature.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.820
The or that I just said, is indicated by that open arc connecting those

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.750
two lines coming out of the transition.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.830
Similarly there are two kinds of engines, electrical and gasoline.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.740
In this case the arc is filled in though,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.950
indicating that you can have a combination.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.890
That is you can have a hybrid engine.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.520
We could imagine a constraint here going between automatic transmission and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.590
pulls trailer, saying that the pulls trailer option is only available if

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.580
you have the automatic transmission and not the manual transmission.
