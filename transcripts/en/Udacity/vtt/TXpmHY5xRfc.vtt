00:00:00.055 --> 00:00:02.800
So let's dive in and talk about Parallel Optimization Patterns.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.396
Now in the supplentary material, you'll find pointers to a fantastic couple of papers by

00:00:07.396 --> 00:00:09.961
John Stratton and colleagues at the University of Illinois.

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:15.250
One is titled, "Optimization and Architecture Effects on GPU Computing and Workload Performance,"

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.580
and it was published in the Innovative Parallel Computing Conference in 2012.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.251
A reworked version of that same basic paper was published later that year in IEEE Computer.

00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:29.398
The Computer paper is a little shorter and more readable.

00:00:29.398 --> 00:00:33.530
Now, what they did is survey a whole bunch of highly optimized

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.037
parallel codes, paid attention to the patterns that emerged, and extracted 7

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:40.651
fundamental techniques that come up over and over again.

00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:43.371
And as you'll see, several of these techniques

00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:46.811
encapsulate or formalize lessons that we've already learned.

00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:48.764
So this will also be a good review of material that we've covered

00:00:48.764 --> 00:00:51.556
in Unit 2 and Unit 5, and along the way in the homeworks.

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:55.164
Let's walk through the taxonomy of seven techniques that that they've come up with.
