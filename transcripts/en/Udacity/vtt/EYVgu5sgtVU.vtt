Alright, so hopefully you used some tools to make that a little bit simpler for

00:00:04.678 --> 00:00:09.109
you. If we load up the developer tools here, we can see that we've already got a

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:13.577
syntax error. And if we go over, and click right here on line 28, and it'll take

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.945
us right to where the offending error is. You can see that it actually doesn't

00:00:17.957 --> 00:00:22.698
technically take us to the error. It takes us to the line after. Sometimes these kinds of tools

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.146
will get you close and then you'll have to figure it out from there.

00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:31.465
So, the problem is right here: you see that local user ID

00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:35.718
colon -1 doesn't have a comma after it, it just ends and since it was

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.581
expecting a comma, well Javascript inserts a semicolon, and that causes issues.

00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:43.134
So let's go ahead and fix that one. Okay.

00:00:43.137 --> 00:00:47.718
So if we insert that comma there, and then reload the page, we get our next

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.431
syntax error at line 103 and the error here is that functions expect

00:00:51.443 --> 00:00:55.557
parenthesis after them where the perameters are. Even if it doesn't take any

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.742
perameters it still expects parenthesis here. Let's go ahead and add those in.

00:00:59.838 --> 00:01:04.305
And again reload the page. And we get to our next error. And this one is way

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:09.820
down on line 207. Now this is maybe a little bit harder to see, but the problem

00:01:09.832 --> 00:01:15.230
is right here, "this:currentTick" should have a dot, as see down here, rather

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:20.960
than a colon, since we use dots to access member methods and variables. Okay, so

00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:26.169
now that we've fixed this here, and then reload, we get to another error on 318.

00:01:26.274 --> 00:01:30.792
And here we can see on line 318 that we have a comma here, where normally we

00:01:30.804 --> 00:01:35.619
would use a colon to specify a member method. So, if we fix that and then reload

00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:40.378
the page, we can see that we don't have any syntax errors left. And, those are

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.847
the only ones that we put in. So, you can see that it was a lot easier to go

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:50.053
through the developer tools and fix these things as necessary, as it pointed it

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:54.947
out to us, rather than trying to walk through the code line-by-line manually.

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:59.444
So, I hope that shows how useful it is to have the proper tools on hand.
