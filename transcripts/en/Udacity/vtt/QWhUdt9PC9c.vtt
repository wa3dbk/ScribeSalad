00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
At the bottom of each homework problem there's a note

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
encouraging students to write their own test cases.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
How does one write good test cases?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That's a surprisingly difficult question.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It turns out that there is an entire area of software engineering practice and research

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
devoted to testing.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Huge amounts of money are spent each year on software testing.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's an amazingly expensive prospect,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and thus, coming up with good test cases is really both an art and a science.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Formally, the basic idea behind testing is to make sure that a program implementation

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
adheres to its specification--

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that is, that what you've actually written down does what we think it should do

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
or what you were required to do.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So if the goal is to make a procedure that finds the biggest element in an array,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
good test cases or a good test suite would give us confidence that you've done just that.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, unfortunately, for interesting programs

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
there are an infinite number of possible test inputs.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
For example, even if you're just trying to write a program to sum the elements of a list,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
there are an infinite number of possible lists of numbers that you could pass in as input.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We don't have time to run an infinite number of test cases,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so often we write just a few and hope that they're indicative in some sense.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Or maybe we hope that they would be very powerful and help us detect errors

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
if there are errors or bugs in our programs.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So one goal for writing a good test suite for making a bunch of test cases is to say,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
"Oh, if I run all of these test cases, I'll have confidence that there are no bugs."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That's easier said than done. How do we actually do it?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
One hint that I would give is to think about corner cases,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to play a little game in your mind.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Imagine that someone else wrote the program and they're trying to be deceptive,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
they're trying to sneak it past you and find mistakes.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It turns out that the human brain is actually very good

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
in the same way that we're very good at vision

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
at finding or detecting cheating or deception when we think someone is working against us.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Take a step back if you can from the code, pretend it's not yours,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
take another look, a fresh look at the specification,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the statement of the problem, and see what you might check.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
For example, for numbers be sure to hit all the corner cases.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Try 0, try some negative numbers, try some positive numbers,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
try some primes, try some composites.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
For lists be sure to try the empty list, all the numbers in order,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
all the numbers in reverse order, all the numbers in a random order.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
If maybe the inputs are grammars or strings, try some short strings

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and some long strings, some grammars with and without recursion.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
This is really more of an art than a science,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
although you may be interested to learn that there are a bunch of great research efforts

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
in automatically constructing test cases.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The basic idea is this:

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You give me your program, and I'm going to write another program that stares at it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and notices all the loops and all of the if statements,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and I'm going to try to generate inputs, maybe at random,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that will cause you to take all the possible branches in your program.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So if you have an if statement that says if X is less than 10,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I will generate 1 input where X is 9 and another where X is 11

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to force you to go down both branches.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
That way if there's something wrong on one of the branches,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
like you use a variable that hasn't been previously initialized,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
you're more likely to find it.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And that field is known as automated test input generation,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and it is still in its infancy.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We have not solved it in any way,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and that means that there is room for creativity.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
One of the themes in this class is that whenever there are an infinite number of possibilities

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
but that we can't use all of them, like in a grammar,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
there's room for creativity.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We have to think of the best ones. We have to do design under constraint.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And unfortunately, ultimately, that's the best answer I can give you here.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Try to think adversarially. Think about all of the corner cases.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Available now are some practice problems in which I go through--

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
essentially I pose homework problems to myself and solve them.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You can find them in the list of videos.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And in each one I inject a bug, a defect, I make a mistake,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and I show how I would use testing and debugging, print statements and whatnot

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
to narrow it down.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
If you're curious or you want a little more practice with testing and debugging,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
check those videos out.
