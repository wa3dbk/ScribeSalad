00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.896
So now we know that threads can access each others' results

00:00:02.896 --> 00:00:04.560
through shared and global memory.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.918
This means they can work together on a computation, but there's a problem.

00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:11.532
What if a thread tries to read a result before another thread

00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:13.490
has had a chance to compute or write it?

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.749
This means we need synchronization.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.323
Threads need to synchronize with each other to avoid this situation.

00:00:19.323 --> 00:00:21.464
This need for synchronization

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:24.594
is really one of the most fundamental problems in parallel computing.

00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:27.668
Now the simplest form of synchronization is called a barrier.

00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:29.966
A barrier is a point in the program

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.636
where all the threads stop and wait.

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:35.035
When all the threads have reached the barrier,

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.741
they can proceed on to the rest of the code.

00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:39.683
Let's illustrate this.

00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:42.912
Here's some threads and they're all proceeding along through to code.

00:00:42.912 --> 00:00:45.041
I'll draw them in different colors,

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:46.719
and I'm also drawing them different lengths

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.416
so that you get the idea that they're at different places in the code.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.389
They're at different points in their execution of the program.

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.871
The idea is that when they reach the barrier,

00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:57.121
they're going to stop and wait for all the others to catch up.

00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:02.866
So in my drawing, the red one reaches the barrier first and stops.

00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:07.938
In the meantime, the blue one is proceeding along, and the green one is proceeding along,

00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:10.500
and eventually the blue one arrives at the barrier

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.407
and stops,

00:01:12.407 --> 00:01:16.379
and the green one is the last one to arrive at the barrier and stops.

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:20.017
And now all 3 threads--in my example, say I only have 3 threads.

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:24.618
Now that all of the threads have arrived at the barrier, then they're all free to go again.

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:28.533
And so they'll all proceed again, and we don't actually know which one's going to go first.

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.667
It might be that the blue one is the first out of the gate,

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:33.930
maybe green is next, maybe red is last.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.225
So let's look at some code to illustrate this.
