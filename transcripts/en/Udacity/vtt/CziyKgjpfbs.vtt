00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.350
So libraries,
what exactly do we mean by a library?

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.470
I love books but that's not the kind
of library we're talking about.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.490
Instead, a library is a packaged
collection of reusable code which

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.950
you include in your app rather
than starting from scratch.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.710
We've already used a few
libraries with Sunshine.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.250
We used AppCompat in
Android Fundamentals One

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.840
to build a consistent look and
feel across all API levels.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.620
And the Support Library Annotations,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.310
just recently, to add a little
bit more type safety to our code.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.520
We certainly could have done all that
ourselves, or skipped it entirely, but

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.530
libraries can often help you
achieve the best user experience

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.030
without you writing and
maintaining a ton of extra code.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.940
Even better, Popular libraries often
have a strong community following and

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.120
a large number of people who can
help you answer your questions.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.334
Not usually the case with your own code.
