00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.190
So how would constraint propagation be useful for Raven's progressive matrices?

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.110
This concept has a strong correspondence to the final project where

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.750
you'll be asked to reason over the images of the problem directly instead of

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.290
over the propositional representations that we've given you in the past. So

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.240
first, if constraint propagation leverages a library of primitive constraints,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.680
what will your constraints be for the final project?

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.070
How will you propagate those constraints into the image to understand it?

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.620
Then once you've actually propagated those constraints, how will you actually

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.710
use those inferences? Will you abstract out propositional representations? Or

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.390
will you stick to the visual reasoning and transfer the results directly?
