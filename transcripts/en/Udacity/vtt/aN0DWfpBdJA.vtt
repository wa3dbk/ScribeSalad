Know that the upper limit of length that we can add to Grant's booth is 10, and

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:08.542
we just need to change the lower limit. It can't go below 0. He could

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:12.939
theoretically add nothing to the length of the booth. So Grant can chose to

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.835
expand each side of his booth anywhere from 0 to 10 feet. Awesome.
