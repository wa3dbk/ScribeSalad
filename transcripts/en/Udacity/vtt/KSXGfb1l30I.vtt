00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here's the answer to our tricky word quiz. Let's go through these answers one by one.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
First, every infection can be traced back to defect that causes it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is actually correct because if we have an infection if we have

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
an error in the program state that is, we can find out which defect causes it namely

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the piece in the program which got the same state as input

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and which produced an erroneous state of infection as output.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Second, every execution of a defect causes an infection. That's actually not the case.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It may will be that there's a defect in the code, which operates only under certain circumstances,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which works fine most of the time, and only under certain circumstances produces an infection.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So this is not correct. Every infection ends in a failure.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If only it were so, then it would be far easier to make a program defect free.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Note, like real infections, they can die out before they ever, ever cause real harm.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Finally, every defect can cause a failure. How? That's tricky.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Remember a defect is an error in the code,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
failure is an error in the execution and infection is an error in the state.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
A defect is an error in the code and you can have an error in the code

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
even in code that's never executed or in code that's actually unreachable.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
How can be it be an error if it can never be executed.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Well, it may well be that over time when the program is maintained,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the error actually becomes executable and then it can actually cause a failure.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It is not the case that every defect always can cause a failure because defects

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
cannot be an unreachable code and therefore, they may not cause a failure.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So this is not correct just as well.
