00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
A third model to device
virtualization is the so-called

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.430
S0plit-Device Driver Model.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.494
This model is called split,

00:00:07.494 --> 00:00:12.655
because all of the device accesses
are controlled in a way that involves

00:00:12.655 --> 00:00:17.128
both a component that resides
in the Guest Virtual Machine and

00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:21.189
also a component that resides
in the hypervisor layer.

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.917
Specifically, devices accesses
are controlled using a device

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:30.431
driver that sits in the Guest VM
called the front-end device driver.

00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:35.906
And then the actual driver for
the physical device that is the regular

00:00:35.906 --> 00:00:41.408
device driver that's used by operating
systems when they run natively.

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:47.570
In this back-end driver, referred to as
back-end resides in the service VM in

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.995
the case where we have a virtualization
model that involves a service VM or

00:00:52.995 --> 00:00:57.625
the host operating system in
the case of type two virtualization.

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:00.424
The point is that this
back-end should really be

00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:04.450
just the regular device driver
that the service, the Linux OS for

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.476
instance and the Service VM would
just be able to install and use,

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:12.610
even if it's not running in
a virtualized environment.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.543
Now although this back-end driver does
not necessarily have to be modified,

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:22.476
the front-end driver has to be modified,
because it explicitly needs to take

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:26.961
the device operations that are made
by the applications in the guest and

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:31.819
then put them together in something that
looks like a, a special message that

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.864
will directly be passed to this back-end
component that's in the service VM.

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:41.826
So this approach, essentially applies
only to paravirtualized guests that

00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:46.900
will be able to explicitly install
these special front-end device drivers.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.745
What these really are, they look like
wrappers for the actual device API.

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:55.449
So the applications potentially,
they don't have to be modified.

00:01:55.449 --> 00:02:00.690
They will continue making the same kinds
of requests for device operations.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.755
But this front-end device driver
will treat these operations,

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:09.508
especially will not attempt to actually
shoot off access to the physical device,

00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:13.120
instead will create messages that
will get passed to the service VM.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.609
One benefit of the approach is that
it can eliminate the overheads that

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.109
are associated with device simulation
that the previous model required.

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.156
Now, we don't have to reverse
engineer exactly what the Guest OS is

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:27.070
trying to do.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.658
The Guest OS via its front
end device driver explicitly

00:02:30.658 --> 00:02:35.189
tells the virtualization layer,
so overall these two components.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.870
What exactly is it that
the guest VM requires.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.215
Another more subtle benefit of the
approach is that now that we have this

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:48.894
back-end component that's
centralized in that it will re,

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:53.653
accept requests from all the Guest VM's
in the system and then try to

00:02:53.653 --> 00:02:58.940
decide which one of those gets to
execute the physical device access.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.240
There's some opportunities for

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.520
some better management of
the shared devices accesses.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.650
So to enforce some finer grained
policies regarding fairness,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.650
regarding priorities and
those sorts of things.
