00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:05.072
Well, for the first question, we know that we're going to loop through this code 64 times,

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:08.544
and we're going to do one multiplication for each iteration,

00:00:08.544 --> 00:00:11.361
so that's going to take 64 multiplications.

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:15.552
And for the second question, we know that each one of these iterations is going to proceed serially,

00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:17.700
one after another after another.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.701
So for each of these 64 iterations, it's going to take us 2 nanoseconds.

00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:26.229
If we multiply those together, we'll see that the answer is 128 nanoseconds.
