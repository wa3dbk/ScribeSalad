00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.800
Here's an example context diagram for a system that plays chess with the user.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.744
The rectangle is the human player, the oval is the chess-playing program, and

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:15.268
there are three lines between them. One line indicates that the human player is

00:00:15.268 --> 00:00:19.520
supplying a move to the chess-playing program. Another line from the chess

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.430
playing program back to the user is the computer's move. And the third line

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.830
indicates that the computer can also put out a diagram describing the board.
