So we've, we've been over constraints, we've been over navigation,

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.230
the third main element of OCL is collections. I've hinted at what that is.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.340
There's, there's four built in collection classes.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.630
We already talked about sets, and bags, and sequences a little bit.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.150
There's an abstract class that sits above them all called the collection class.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.820
These four classes are organized with the collection class being a parent class,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.580
and the collection class has various operators such as, size which we saw and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.600
count, and sums, and ways of interrating over the collection and so on.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.480
That are inherited by all of the three other collection classes. Moreover, those

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.650
collection classes, those three other concrete collection classes may themselves

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.380
have some specialized operations. The OCL reference manual has a complete list

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.630
of all the operations that are available to you for dealing with collections
