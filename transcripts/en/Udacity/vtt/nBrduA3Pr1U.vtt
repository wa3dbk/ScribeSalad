00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
This is a bit of a tricky question, so let's go over the first one first

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.610
and let's go back and take a look at the code.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.670
So, most of these are arithmetic operations and if you remember from the RAM model that we've

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.490
been discussing in the lecture that according to the RAM model that we've been using,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:28.550
all arithmetic operations take constant time, so it means this, this, this, and this all take constant time.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:37.410
The only thing that doesn't is this for loop right here. So how many times does the for loop execute?

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.680
Well, that executes based on n, the value of the input about square root of n times

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.030
and if everything else is constant time and this executes square root of n times,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.410
well from around the order the square root of n.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.020
You can go ahead and check this.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.890
So this next part is very pretty tricky and it hinges on getting this part right.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.019
So if you have trouble with this, that is totally understandable.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.660
So first, let's remember that we can represent n

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.610
with a logarithm and number of digits which is what d is.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.280
What this means is that n=c where c is just some constant that we're not going by * 10⁻¹

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.000
and as an example of this, let's say, that n is 4000 like we had before.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.550
So 4000=c where c is something * 10d⁻¹, d is 4-1 is ³,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.940
and well then that means that this has to be 4, 4*10³ is 4000.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.340
So this is how it represent an n by d and c is just some constant to make everything more count

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.990
and since this is big O equation, we're not really that concerned with constants.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.130
Now, if we know this and we also know that the algorithm

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.360
has a running time from the order of square root of n, and we're talking about it in terms of n,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.550
and then we can put these together, so square root of n is the square root of all this

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.610
and we're going to have to do a bit of math here.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:26.660
Well, we can separate this two out to the √c and √10d⁻¹,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:37.280
well we can describe this by saying this, 10d⁻¹/2 since that's exactly that the square root is.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.380
And now we can pull this out and so now we have this nice three separate terms,

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.470
and again since we don't really care about constants, we can just kind of get rid of these.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.920
We can say that √c * 10⁻¹/² is just some other constant we don't really care about code k.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.330
Because the only thing we really care about is D.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.960
So this is k * 10d/² and this is exactly what we need to say

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.850
but this algorithm is in big O notation until we can say that in terms of d

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.230
the running time in this algorithm is 0(10d/2).

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.760
Now, if you didn't get that or if you had problems with it,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.690
don't worry about that it's really kind of a challenging problem

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.960
and if you still don't understand it,then I recommend checking on the forms and discussing it.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.260
This is really the kind of basic math calculations that you're going to have to do

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.460
and part of the problem here that a lot of people run into is

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.150
these constants that we just drop or don't care about really

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.880
and that's the kind of thing that makes big O notation really very powerful

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.920
that we can just drop those and say we don't really care about those in the grand scheme of things.
