00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.002
This is a simple example of the Geolocation API, you

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:07.280
call getCurrentPosition and pass it a call back and the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.230
call back is called when it gets your location and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.830
gives you your latitude and longitude. There's also a very

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.500
similar watch position call, which does the same thing except

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.940
continually calls you every time the position is updated. Let's

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.490
walk through how we use this API in our conference

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.890
app. First, we added a button to the map page

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.810
that triggers the Geolocation procedure. When this button

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.900
is pressed, the triggerGeolocation method in our code

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.600
is called. This code is the heavy lifting

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.570
of the triggerGeolocation method. This uses the HTML5

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.800
Geolocation method API method, getCurrentPosition. And passes it

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.250
a success call back and an error callback.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.110
It also enables high accuracy and sets a time out. In case of failure, we print

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.140
a generic, Sorry, we couldn't find your location.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.750
On the other hand, if we succeed, we call

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.840
a method called elaborateDistance. ElaborateDistance uses the root

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.010
method from the Google Maps direction service to obtain

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.490
an object containing information about the route between

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.980
the user's position and the venue. It then displays

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.560
some of this information and allows you to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.530
open up Google Maps with the route already set.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800
Obviously, this is frequently the way that you'll

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.260
use Geolocation data, that is, passing it off

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.940
to another control. Most of us don't, write

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.900
code that uses this latitude and longitude directly.
