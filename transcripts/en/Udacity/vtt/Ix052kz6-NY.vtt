00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.140
Okay so we have seen that there is a problem when multiple instructions execute

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.350
in the same cycle. And the problem occurs because we need to

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.020
read registers before the previous instructions have written them. Because those

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.410
previous instructions now execute at the same time as our instruction.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.450
And then we can see that problem really occurs in the execute stage because we

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.550
are just operating on wrong value. So let's see in the execute stage if

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.100
forwarding can help us with this. If you remember your pipelining.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.900
What forwarding does is it feeds the value from the previous instruction to

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.480
the subsequent instructions because those values have actually been written to

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.510
register. So let's see if that helps. If you remember,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.390
we had our instructions and now we are just going to look at the execute stage,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.484
and we are going to have our instruction just be I1, I2, I3, I4 and

00:00:49.484 --> 00:00:54.460
I5, and remember that there was a dependence from I1 to I2. So

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.400
now what would happen is, we execute I1 at some point, and

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.730
in the same cycle we execute I2. So the problem with forwarding is

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.760
that it would be able to feed this value to the instruction in the next cycle.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.730
But not to an instruction in the same cycle. Cause basically if you look at

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.400
the timeline for the cycle. This is the kind of beginning of the execute stage.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.590
This is the end of the execute stage. In here somewhere,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.100
we are kind of taking two values, operating on them, producing the result.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.510
This result is available kind of here, at the end of the cycle.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.970
Meanwhile, the other instruction is taking its values during the subtraction,

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.150
producing a result. And this is where forwarding can provide this value.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.790
If forwarding worked, it would have to provide the value here, and

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.530
any arrow that goes backward here means basically time travel. So pretty much

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.360
you would produce a result and, you know, one cycle send it back in time one

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.980
nanosecond earlier, so that it can be used here which is of course impossible.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.910
So we cannot do that. What we will do is not execute this instruction here.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.990
We will have to stall meaning this instruction has to be delayed it just cannot

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.230
execute in this cycle. It will execute in the next cycle. If I3,

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.740
I4 and I5 don't have any dependencies with I1, they can still execute you

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.050
know they have read the register values they're going to be able to execute. So

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.476
now what we have is really. We spent two cycles executing five instructions,

00:02:26.476 --> 00:02:29.510
okay? So if we ignore the filling of the pipeline and so on,

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.700
basically what we have now is the CPI is equal to two over five in this case,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.360
which is approximately 0.4. Actually, it is 0.4. So what we have is a CPI of,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.010
you know, instead of it being 0.2 for these five instructions, it would be 0.4.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.730
If we have a lot of instructions, there will be a lot of these dependencies. So

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.220
we will actually have to spend, you know, we will have a CPI that is not zero,

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.060
even if we had an infinite number of execution units.
