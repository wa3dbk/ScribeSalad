00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, just to give you a review of scoring if you aren't familiar with the rules.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The letters score their value--the number that's on them--times whatever you've placed them on

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
if that's a double or triple letter score.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Here I don't have any double or triple letter scores, so I get the individual values of the letters--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
10, 11, 12, 22--times the total word multiplier,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the pink square are double word scores,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so that's a double multiplier--22 times 2 is 44 points for that.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Then if the next play goes here, it has to connect.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now, this was a double word, but I don't get any double, because I didn't actually place

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
a new tile over an existing double word, so nothing is doubled,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but I do get credit for the Z, even though I didn't place the Z.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I get credit for that as 10, not as 20 as it originally scored, but as its face value--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
10 plus 1--this is a triple 1, so that's plus 3 plus 1--10, 11, 14, 15.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Then if the next play, say, was here, that would just a score 3, 4, 5.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I didn't have any bonuses whatsoever.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This bonus here doesn't count, because I didn't play over it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If a bonus is already covered up, it doesn't county any more, so this would just be 5.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
One more scoring rule.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If this is the word on the board--great play putting the Q on a double letter

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and a double word as well--this would score 20--1, 2, 3, 4 times 2 is 48.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The next play could be this, which simultaneously forms 3 words--

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
NO in this direction and then IN and NO in this direction.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
For NO, we'd get a double letter is 2 plus 1 is 3.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
For IN, we get just 1 plus 1, so that's 3 plus 2 is 5.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And for NO we get another 3, so that would be a score of 8 altogether.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Here is calculate_score. It takes all these variables that we need to specify the play.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
We're going to start out a total of my word multiplier--

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that is, have I got any double or triple letters, and there might be more than one of them.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
If I had a long word that matches up with some existing letters on the board,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
then I'd get credit, and if. I covered a double and a triple letter, then I'd multiply by 6

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I need to keep track of that. Then I also want to keep track of the cross word totals.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Not the word I'm playing but the other cross words, but they are separate from this word multiplier.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Figure out where my starting position is from that position.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Figure out the direction that I'm moving in--down or across--what the delta are.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Figure out what the other direction is.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
If I'm moving in the cross direction, I want to know that the other direction is the down direction.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now just enumerate the words.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Enumerate the letters in the word and the position within the word.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Figure out the square on the board and the bonus squares, the word multiplier,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
if the square was already placed on the board,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
so if it is a letter--and I've got a function for that.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I should be defining this here, so this is a bad piece code.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I should be calling is_letter(sq) rather than testing directly,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
since is decided to make that more abstract.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Figure out the word multiplier from the bonuses.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You only get the bonus if the letter wasn't already on the board.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Figure out the letter multipler--same thing.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Increment my points by the points from the letter times the letter multiplier,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and now if the square is an anchor and the anchor is not one of these unrestricted anchors,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
then we want to look for the cross words.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If there is a cross word, figure out the cross word score and add that into the total.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Why do I have this direction is not down here?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Because I'm going to do--cross word score is going to recursively calculate score,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and we don't want it to recurse infinitely. We just want it to recurse once.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
To explain that a little bit more, note up here in horizontal_plays we're calling calculate _score,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
so the only place we call calculate_score is here, and we're calling it with the across.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
The way we get the down is because we transpose the board.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So for calculate score, we know we're going to be called with the across direction the first time

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and then the down direction the second time.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Although, I guess I feel a little bit bad that that assumption that we're always going to be called

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
with across the first time is kind of hardwired into this.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
That makes calculate_score a little bit brittle.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Probably, I should refactor this to stop the recursion in some other way.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
But I'm so close to the finish line now I don't want to stop to clean things up.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I want to get to the end.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Here is cross<u>word</u>score. Figure out the position.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
We find the cross word. That's a function we already wrote.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Then we recursively call calculate_score.
