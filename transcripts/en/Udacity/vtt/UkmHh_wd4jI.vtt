Match this example with the type of personality disorder. Mohammad likes to be

00:00:04.662 --> 00:00:10.012
alone and doesn't enjoy being with others or activities with others. He goes to

00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:12.652
work and then goes right home without really interacting with any of his

00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:16.560
colleagues. He doesn't really care what other people think of him, they could

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.115
congratulate him or reprimand him, but neither would really affect him. Check

00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:22.719
which one you think applies.
