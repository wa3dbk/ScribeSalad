00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, in our very first quiz we're just going to look it up.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It turns out there was other sold at the same size, and it brought in $104,000.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In the interest of statistics, the answer is $104,000.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is not the game theory class.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Obviously, you wouldn't want to bid that much,

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but in the interest of statistics, that's what you'd expect to pay.
