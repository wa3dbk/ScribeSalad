Object hierarchy is unrelated to the other three topics. Right-handed

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:06.984
coordinates, the cross product, and the mirror transform all have to do with

00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:11.312
handedness in some way. For example, the resulting direction of the cross

00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:14.302
product of two vectors is determined by the right-hand rule, if you're using a

00:00:14.302 --> 00:00:18.234
right-handed coordinate system. A mirror reflection switches from one

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:19.549
handedness to the other.
