00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.352
Grant has decided that he wants to diversify his product base. He's created a

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:08.557
new kind of wiper set to add to his glasses family. This is the Deluxe Duo, a

00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:13.126
set of glasses wipers unlike any other every created. They have superior wiping

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:17.663
power and non function curly qs for decoration on the ends of them. With them.

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:22.035
Now, as silly as these glasses wipers might seem to you or me, Grant has a

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:26.941
reason for creating them. He can charge a lot of money. In fact, of just one set

00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:31.365
of deluxe duo glasses wipers, he can charge $75. This is big money in the

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:36.352
glasses wiper business. If we let the number of deluxe glasses wipers sold equal

00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:41.070
m, and Grant's total profit in dollars from them equal p. Then I've created an

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.358
equation for you that describes his profit based on the number of deluxe glasses

00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:49.505
wipers he sold. You know $75 is how much he charges per pair of deluxe glasses

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:53.470
wipers, and $5000 is the amount of money that he had to put down to invest in

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.766
the materials and everything he needed to start building these. So, we have an

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.151
equation, and we have a wonderful product.
