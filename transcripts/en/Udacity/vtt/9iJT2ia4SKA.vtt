00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now let's look at a couple applications, if we could build a cryptosystem like this.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
First we'll look at a standard use of it to send private messages.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is what our goal was initially for the symmetric cryptosystems.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That assumed that we had a shared key to begin with.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now let's assume that we don't.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's assume Alice wants to send a private message to Bob.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
She doesn't have a secure channel, and she doesn't have a key shared with Bob,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but she does know Bob's public key.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We'll call that KUB.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Bob knows his private key that corresponds to the public key that Alice

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
as well as anyone else who wants to know knows is associated with Bob.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now Alice can send a message to Bob,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
encrypting it with Bob's public key knowing that the only one who can decrypt it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is someone who knows Bob's private key, which should be only known to Bob.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Bob decrypts the message using his private key.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now we'll have a quiz to see that everyone is understanding asymmetric cryptosystems.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What correctness property does this rely on?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Here are the three choices.

00:01:04.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Pick the one that this private messaging system is relying about the E and the D functions.
