00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.859
So let's try to define a hash function

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.780
that has these properties. And what we want the

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.510
hash function to do is to take a string

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.010
as its input, we'll call the hash function hash_string,

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.604
and it'll produce as output a number between 0

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:21.010
and b-1. So, we also need another input to

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.180
our hash string, which is going to be the size

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.290
of the hash table. So that'll be the second

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.880
input is the size of the hash table, the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.670
number of buckets. What we haven't seen yet, that

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.540
we're going to need for this function, is a way

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.920
to turn a string into a number. Python provides an

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.030
operation to do that. It's called ord as an

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.410
ordinal, and what ord takes as it's input is

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.920
a one letter string and produces as it's output

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.350
a number. And actual mapping between strings and numbers is

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.300
not so important. We just want something

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.830
that is going to map different string to

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.400
different numbers. There's another operator that goes in

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.156
the opposite direction that takes in a number,

00:01:00.156 --> 00:01:04.690
and outputs the one-letter string that corresponds to

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.810
that number. And the property these functions have

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.510
is their inverses. That if we take the

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.415
character corresponding to the ordinal corresponding to any

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:21.530
one-letter string. We'll call that alpha. What we get as a result is the same

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.440
alpha that we passed in. So let's try

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.970
a few examples in the python interpreter to

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.150
see how ord and chr work. So we'll print ord of a, and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.270
when we run that we see we get the number 97. If we try print ord of capital A.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.020
That's different. We get 65. And if we print ord of B,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.740
we get 66. So, the numbers are sort of sensible.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.810
B is higher than A. The lower case letters have

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.210
different ordinals than the upper case. So, if we try

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.606
a lower case b, we should expect to get 98.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.730
And that is indeed what we get. And these are

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.840
the numbers based on the ASCII character encoding, what

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.639
the actual numbers are, are not very important for us,

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.010
other than that we get different number for different letters.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.760
So we'll be able to use the results

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.980
of ord to make different strings hash to different

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:24.320
values. And just to show that there are inverses. If we do ord of u, and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.420
then chart of that, what we get back

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.520
is the single letter string u that we started

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.840
with. The limit of ord is it only works

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.580
on one-letter strings. If it provided a mapping from

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.220
any string to a number that would be useful for a

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.910
hash table. Well, then we'd be done. But it doesn't do that.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.770
If we try running it on a multi-letter string, we get

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.110
an error. It says that ord expects a single character, but it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.070
got a string of length 7. So we're going to need to

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.810
use ord only on single letter strings. So with ord, we have

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.850
a way of converting strings to numbers. Converting single character strings

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.060
to numbers. The other property we need our hash function to have,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.900
is that our output number is always between 0 and B minus 1. We need it to be in

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.520
that range, because we're going to use that to index

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.240
the list, to find the bucket where that string belongs.
