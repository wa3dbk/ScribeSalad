00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.660
p plus 4 divided by the quantity p plus 2 is correct. Impressive work if you've

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.715
got that correct. To divide by a rational expression, we multiply by the

00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:13.735
reciprocal of the second fraction. Now, we really just have a multiplication

00:00:13.735 --> 00:00:18.534
problem that we're familiar with. We factor this trinomial to get p plus 5 time

00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:23.935
p minus 1 and we factor this denominator to get p plus 5 times p plus 2. These

00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:28.833
factors reduce to 1 and we're left with p plus 4 in our numerator, and p plus 2

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.233
in our denominator.
