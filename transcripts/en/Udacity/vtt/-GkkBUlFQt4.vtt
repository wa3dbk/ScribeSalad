00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.410
I can actually talk more about jQuery.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.380
It is a DOM manipulation library.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:16.700
By DOM manipulation library I mean that
it traverses through your HTML elements.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.579
So it's going to help
you handle the events

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.364
taking place within your HTML elements.

00:00:24.364 --> 00:00:26.030
It's very fast.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.298
It's a JavaScript.

00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:30.946
It's completely coded in JavaScript.

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:35.812
And yeah, you can use it for
a lot of your projects

00:00:35.812 --> 00:00:40.682
where you want to change
content within your HTML

00:00:40.682 --> 00:00:45.673
elements directly through
a function rather than

00:00:45.673 --> 00:00:51.160
going to your HTML page and
hard coding values into it.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.369
This dynamically changes how-
&gt;&gt; How would I go on jQuery?

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:59.703
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah,
we can actually look at that.

00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:04.007
So yeah, here are what I've done is,

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:08.600
I've opened up jQuery.js in Sublime.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.178
So, this is going to be
your JavaScript library.

00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:18.647
Instead, [CROSSTALK] yeah we've already
given this file to you in advance.

00:01:18.647 --> 00:01:23.900
And this is helper.js which
is also provided to you.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:32.390
So helper.js has a bunch of
variables that map to HTML elements.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.257
Like for example,
with helper.html header name.

00:01:37.257 --> 00:01:40.659
It contained the header tag
h1 with the ID name and

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.930
you've put in some data inside.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.774
This is all populated from JSON.

00:01:46.774 --> 00:01:52.669
So wherever you have the percentage
data is populated from a JSON object.

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:53.591
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:55.730
&gt;&gt; So that's what we are doing here.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.581
So these variables help
you map to the HTML form,

00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:06.012
it's designing your HTML webpage.

00:02:06.012 --> 00:02:12.204
Okay, when you see this bit
of code right here down here,

00:02:12.204 --> 00:02:17.790
you can see
the $document.readyfunction().

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.150
So the dollar symbols of the notes with
jQuery produce jQuery class.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.626
Yes, so when you see,
when you take this particular

00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:32.510
line $ in braces,
you have a button.click.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.360
What you are defining is any
element with the name button.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.416
So we have one button in our
resume in our HTML page.

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:45.261
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And so it's going to pick that button

00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:51.110
element and it's going to define
a click event handler on it.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.860
&gt;&gt; And then the dollar sign is
telling me that it's jQuery?

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.554
&gt;&gt; That's right,
it's pointing to jQuery.
