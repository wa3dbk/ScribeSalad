00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What I'd like you to do for this quiz is

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
make the query function return the ID of the link

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that was submitted by user 62443

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and has greater than 1000 votes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This time I didn't leave you any code to work with,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but you can still scroll up in the file and see the example here.
