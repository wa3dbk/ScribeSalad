00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.390
As important of an idea as intelligence is, it's hard to both define, and

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.988
measure. But it has been measured, and tested for over 100 years. The first

00:00:09.988 --> 00:00:14.462
person to do this was Alfred Binet in 1903. He was looking for a measure that

00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:17.360
he could give to all students in the parish school district to assess who was

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.241
struggling. Binet did some things that are still used today. He started with

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:27.420
simple problems. But it got more difficult as the test went on. Now, he gave

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.324
this test to thousands of children to see what was the normal or average score

00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:37.205
for the different age groups. Now, years later, in the 1920s, other

00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:43.744
psychologists built and developed the first Intelligence Quotient, the IQ. This

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:48.146
is when the IQ actually got its name. They started with the mental age of each

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:52.560
child. They were looking at what age most children stopped solving problems of

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.773
a certain difficulty. So if you solved problems that most seven-year olds

00:00:56.773 --> 00:01:01.224
solve, but not most six year olds, then you have a mental age of seven. This is

00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:04.528
regardless of your chronological age but they did also look at your

00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:10.328
chronological age or how you are in years. Taking these two things together,

00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:15.420
your mental age and chronological age, made up the fist IQ ratios. So your IQ

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.540
is defined as your mental age over your chronological age times 100 which was

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.070
the average. And that gave you your IQ score. So for example, if a child had a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.480
mental age of ten and a chronological age of ten then their IQ would be 100.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.890
And this is the average for her age. In fact, 100 is always the average of IQ.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.602
But, if a ten year old was solving problems at a 12 year old level, then his or

00:01:46.602 --> 00:01:53.284
her IQ would be 120, whihc is above the normal IQ score. Likewise if a ten year

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:58.116
old child can only solve problems at an eight year old's level. Your IQ would

00:01:58.116 --> 00:02:02.820
be 80, just below the norm. People who are scoring above 100 are scoring at a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.890
higher intellectual level than most of the population. People that are scoring

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.253
less than 100 are scoring at a lower intellectual level than most of the

00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:12.980
population.
