X must not exceed 2.5 inches if we want to avoid running into the same problem

00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:09.448
that we ran into just a second ago. Here's why. Of the two sides of our original

00:00:09.448 --> 00:00:14.555
piece of paper, the 5 inch long one is the shorter one. And we'll end up without

00:00:14.555 --> 00:00:19.576
a flap to fold up from the 5 inch side. If the side length of the square that we

00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:24.136
cut out is at least as long as half the length of this side, which is 2.5

00:00:24.136 --> 00:00:24.750
inches.
