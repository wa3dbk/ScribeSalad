advertisers are as well. In fact, many psychology majors go into the field of

00:00:07.784 --> 00:00:12.308
advertising. Because they learn about what motivates people, what influences

00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:15.730
people or limits to sensation and perception, as well as how to measure

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.084
satisfactions. All of these things, motivation, influence, and sensation, and

00:00:21.084 --> 00:00:26.440
perception are involved in advertising. Advertisers as well as many individuals

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:36.060
someone's beliefs or attitudes via communication by another person.
