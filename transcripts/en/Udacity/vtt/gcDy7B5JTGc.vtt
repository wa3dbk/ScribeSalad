If you got 9 over 25, you got it right. We know to divide fractions, we want to

00:00:05.683 --> 00:00:11.416
multiply by the reciprocal. So I can rewrite this problem as a multiplication

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:17.020
problem as 24 over 35 times the reciprocal of the second fraction which is 21

00:00:17.032 --> 00:00:22.838
over 40. So instead of multiplying 24 times 21 and trying to reduce that I can

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.707
factor before I multiply. So 24 can be written as 6 times 4. 35 can be written

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:34.390
as 7 times 5. 21 can be written as 7 times 3. And 40 can be written as 4 times

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:40.321
10. From here, I notice that there's a 7 in my numerator and in my denominator

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:43.204
and we know that 7 over 7 equals 1 And.

00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:48.205
We know that 4 over 4 is equal to 1. Now, we can multiply the numerators

00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:53.665
together. 6 times 3 is 18 and 5 times 10 is equal to 50, Whenever I do problems

00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:59.345
with fractions, I always want to make sure that my final answer is in simplified

00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:06.220
form, So I need to see if 18 over 50 is simplified. Well, I notice right away

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:13.520
that 18 is an even number and 50 is an even number, so they're both divisible by

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:19.960
2. So I can write 18 at 9 times 2, and I can write 50 as 25 times 2. Now that I

00:01:19.972 --> 00:01:25.835
have these in factored form I can cross out 2 over 2, now we get to our final

00:01:25.847 --> 00:01:27.207
answer which is 9 over 25.
