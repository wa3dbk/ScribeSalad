00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.830
To help me situate this let's look
at image transformations in general.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.120
So far we have looked
at image filtering.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.270
Now what we're going to talk about is
image warping or image transformation.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.160
So here basically assume
we have an image,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.219
f, and what we're interested in doing
is some sort of a transformation.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:16.920
So for example,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.620
what we have looked at is we have
transformed this image to a new one,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.010
and here, hopefully you can see that
this image is now much brighter.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.800
If you remember where
we've looked at before,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.800
one of the best ways of doing this would
be to look, loop over the entire image,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.800
and look at each and every intensity,
and perhaps do some calculations to it.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.880
In this one, I just added, let's say,
20 more intensity points to it.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.640
Now of course this image is brighter.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.340
Here now,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850
let's do another form of transformation
to get the output image g.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.870
Here, if you notice what we've done,

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.970
is we've actually now
stretched out the image.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.150
So if you look at this
number of columns here,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.130
there are more number of columns here.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.330
Of course, so
far the same number of rows.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.860
So in essence,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.490
we've changed the width of the image,
keeping the height the same.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.630
So in the case of doing filtering, what
we're basically doing is we're changing

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.020
the range of the image, the inside
values of the function itself.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.740
So basically to get the output image,
what we basically have done is done

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.955
put in a function and transformed the
function itself to get the new image.

00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:22.405
In case of changing the size of
the image and such, what we're basically

00:01:22.405 --> 00:01:26.375
changing is the number of things
like rows and columns, the insight.

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:31.245
Not the content, but the indexes
of the matrix that we're changing.

00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:32.615
To do this, of course,

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:36.810
we basically are now growing
a transformation of the insides.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.440
That is the width and the height and all
of the information associated with it.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.940
And that's changing the function.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.240
So the transformation of course in
this one image is the change of

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.870
domain of the image as opposed
to change of range of the image.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.400
Those of you curious about these terms,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.270
I encourage you to look back
to your old calculus or

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.700
algebra material on defining what is
a range and domain of a function.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.360
And, of course,
here our function is always at image.
