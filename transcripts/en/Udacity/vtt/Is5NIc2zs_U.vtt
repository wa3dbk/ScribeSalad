00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.120
So this is the first input to web application, and the first entry in this tuple

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.210
is what's known as the regular expression. Now what a regular expression is, is

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.620
a compact way to describe a set of strings. And computer scientists often talk

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.749
about sets of strings as being a language. This is a bit of a misnomer since a

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.998
language has not just a set of strings but a way to map those strings to

00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:24.818
meaning. With a regular expression, all we're doing is defining a set of

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:29.170
strings. But regular expressions are a really interesting and powerful idea.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.433
We're only going to touch this surface here.
