00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So let's make sure that we really understand list comprehensions by doing them backwards.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Suppose what I really want is for the output to be the list 1, 2, 3.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I have 5 expressions here, each one of which is a list comprehension.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In this multiple, multiple choice quiz,

00:00:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
mark each one that's going to produce 1, 2, 3 as its output.
