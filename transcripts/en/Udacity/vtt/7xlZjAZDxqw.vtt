00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.910
Now at first glance, 
reducing the payload

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.270
of each transfer,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.286
and only transmitting data
when it's required

00:00:05.286 --> 00:00:07.152
seems like a sound approach.

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:09.330
You're reducing the amount
of data being transferred,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.813
so that's less data on the network.

00:00:10.813 --> 00:00:12.696
That's less superfluous
work being done

00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:15.844
storing processing data
on the device.

00:00:15.844 --> 00:00:18.092
It's basically a case
of putting off any work

00:00:18.092 --> 00:00:19.900
until you actually know
you need to do it.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.140
But it turns out that this
approach has it's drawbacks,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.980
compared to the big cookie model
of doing all that work up front.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.880
So, overall, this is
a better solution.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.470
But let's take a closer look
at the big cookie model.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.369
And to do that, we really 
need to understand

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.000
the underlying
cell radio state machine.
