00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.532
Here are the means of each. And then since we have the same sample size in

00:00:05.532 --> 00:00:12.389
each, the grand mean can just be the mean of the means. 13 plus 48 plus 45

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.721
divided by 3, which is about 35.33. But you can also calculate the grand mean

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:25.272
by adding 15 plus 12 plus 14, et cetera, to 38, and then dividing by 12. That's

00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:28.692
how you would find the grand mean otherwise, if the sample sizes were

00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:30.216
different.
