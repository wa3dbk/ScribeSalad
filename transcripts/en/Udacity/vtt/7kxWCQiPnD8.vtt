00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.290
So this is the basic definition of a pinhole camera or a camera obscura.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.300
The basic idea is that if you have a 3D scene and if you can

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.700
create a small device like this one, which basically has a small hole,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.820
a pinhole, then all the light from this 3D scene would go through this pinhole.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.860
And if you put some sort of a screen or a sensor inside this box,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.120
it'll appear upside down inside this box.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.110
The simplest definition of a camera, therefore, would be as basically how light

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.350
goes through this hole, is generated upside down in the back of this box.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.300
And if you notice, all the light is basically going in from one hole and

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.252
appearing upside down here.

00:00:45.252 --> 00:00:48.060
And now, of course, the simplest thing we can do to make this

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.290
into a camera that would preserve this image,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.920
would be to be able to store this image in some form or the other.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.460
I'm just showing you a few more examples.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.040
These are the classic examples of pinhole cameras.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.660
And I did mention earlier that this definition of

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.209
a camera has existed from about three to 400 BC.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.590
Where you would put a light source here, go through a pinhole, and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.890
an image would be formed upside down inside the box.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.640
And this was a classic method used in the old days also, where basically 3D

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.160
scenes like this would actually be captured through a pinhole upside down.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.790
And people would actually use various types of sketching mechanisms to

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.010
preserve this.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.790
And they would actually do sketching or painting on a wall to preserve this.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.585
Of course, we have many different methods of preserving this, and

00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:35.980
there's a whole lot of stuff about both films, and

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.850
of course, digital sensors that can do this.
