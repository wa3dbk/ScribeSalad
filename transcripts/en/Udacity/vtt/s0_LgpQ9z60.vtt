00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.010
Is another way to avoid image files and
to keep your site responsive.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.620
If you need to use a graphical
symbol like an arrow, a star or

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.740
a heart, check whether it's
available as a character

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.180
in a font you might be
surprised what's available.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.110
When symbols and
icons are achieved using fonts,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.590
they have all the response
of advantages of text.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.300
They're infinitely scalable,
amenable to texts,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.100
CSS effects, and
don't incur extra download.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.250
The graphics on this page
are built without image files.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.619
The body has a CSS gradient and

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.500
the star is just a text character
with a CSS shadow applied.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.060
All responsibly sized.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.080
The Unicode standard defines
the universal character set.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.250
Over 100,000 characters
have been defined so far.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.540
Some fonts support many
thousands of these.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.040
