So, one way I get ideas is to check out
the featured apps on the App Store.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.500
And I download almost all of them,
because you just get great ideas.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.910
There's so
much creativity in the community.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.390
So looking at other people's apps and
other companies' apps,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.870
you'll just find things that you would
have never thought of on your own, and

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.720
things that sort of inspire you to
take your own work to the next level.
