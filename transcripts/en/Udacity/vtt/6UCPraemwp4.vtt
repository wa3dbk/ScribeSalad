00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That's amazing--even though there is not a fixed dollar price per square foot,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the relationship is linear.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here is a a really challenging question.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In this data, the prize is linear in the size plus or minus a constant dollar amount.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Can you fill in those values?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I should say this is a nontrivial question,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and I don't expect you to get this right, but it's a wonderful, wonderful preview

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
of what I'll teach you to do in this class very automatically using really amazing

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
pieces of statistics.
