00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.630
Okay so, classification learning. Before we get into the details of

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.620
that, I want to define a couple of terms. Because we're going to

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.890
be throwing these terms out all throughout the lessons. And I

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.710
want to make certain that we're all on the same page and we

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.060
mean the same thing. But we're returning to this again and

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.180
again and again. So, the first term I want to introduce is the

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.130
notion of instances. So, instances, or another way of thinking about them is

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.250
input. Those are vectors of valu, of attributes. That define

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.220
whatever your input space is. So they can be pictures,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.420
and all the pixels that make up pictures like we've been

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.350
doing so far before. They can be credit score examples like

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.265
how much money I make, or how much money Michael makes.

00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:43.930
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.760
How much money I wish I made, so on and so fourth. So

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.380
whatever your input value is, whatever it is you're using to describe the input,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.070
whether it's pixels or its discrete values, those are

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.570
your instances, the set of things that you're looking

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.170
at. So you have instances, that's the set of

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.150
inputs that you have. And then what we're trying

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.530
to find is some kind of function And that

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.780
is the concept that we care about. And this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.720
function actually maps inputs to outputs, so it takes

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.610
the instances, it maps them in this case to some

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.650
kind of output such as true or false. This is the,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.520
the categories of things that we're worried about. And for most of

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.150
the conversation that we're going to be having, we're going to be thinking

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.140
about binary classification, just true and false. But the truth is, this

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.020
would work whether there were three outputs, as we did with

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.340
high school, college, or grad school, or whether there were 250 as

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.450
we were contemplating for ages. But the main thing here is the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.640
concept, is the function that we care about that's going to map pictures,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.300
for example, to true or false.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.190
&gt;&gt; So okay, I get, I get the use of the word," instance", right?" Instance"

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.130
is just, like, a single thing that's out there. But I have an intuitive notion

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.600
of what a concept is. How does that relate to this more formal notion? Like,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.130
can we connect this to, kind of, the intuitive notion of what a concept is?

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.200
&gt;&gt; I guess so. So a concept, I don't know. How

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.620
would you want to put that? So a concept is something That,

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.070
I mean were talking about is a notion of a

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.420
function, so what it means formally is that you have

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.950
some input, like a picture, and it immediately inputs maps

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.980
anything in that input space to some particular defined output

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.110
space, like true or false, or male or female, or

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.640
credit, credit worthy or not. Intuitively a concept is an

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.980
idea describes a set of things. OK, so we can

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.725
talk about maleness or femaleness. We can talk about short and

00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:34.950
tall; we can talk about college students

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.390
and grad students. And so the concept is

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.260
the notion of what creditworthiness is, what

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.400
a male is, what a college student is.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.990
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think I see that. So, so essentially if you want to think

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.390
of tallness, the concept of tallness, one way to define it is to say, Well in

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.480
general if you give me something I can tell you rather or not its [UNKNOWN]

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.520
so it's going to map those somethings to am I tall or not. True or false.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.580
&gt;&gt; Right. Exactly and so

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.090
really when you think about any concept and we talk about

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.700
this in generally [UNKNOWN] is effectively a way of saying is

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.690
effectively a set of things. That are apart of that concept.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.170
So, you can have a concept of a car and if I

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.820
gave you "cars" you would say these things are in it

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.400
and if I gave you "non-cars" you would say they are not.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.200
And so a concept is, therefore by definition, a mapping between

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.580
objects in a world and membership in a set, which makes it

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.920
a function.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.130
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.720
&gt;&gt; Okay.
