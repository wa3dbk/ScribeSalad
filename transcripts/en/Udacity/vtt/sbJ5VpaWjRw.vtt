00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.780
Now, it's your turn to make a form and
Flask.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.455
Create a template called,

00:00:03.455 --> 00:00:07.755
editMenuItem.html that allows me to
edit the name, of a specific menu item.

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:09.850
A major difference between this form,
and

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.500
the new menu form is that now
you should find the menu item,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.140
you want to edit, and pass that in
with the render template function.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.510
Use the placeholder tag in HTML,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.230
so that the user sees the information
that they're about to modify.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.290
Also, add a link called, Cancel that
will take me back to the main menu page,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.590
if I decide I don't want to
modify a menu item.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.080
In the instructor notes, you'll find
a project.py file that already has

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.290
the editMenuItem function filled out, so

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.590
you just need to create the form
that will communicate with it.
