The people at the Expo love Grant's product, his glasses wipers. But they find

00:00:04.832 --> 00:00:09.683
that washing their glasses with water just isn't enough. There needs to be some

00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:14.317
sort of cleaning solution that will be the solution to their problem. Grant

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.976
decides to get on it right away. He contacts the three biggest lens cleaning

00:00:18.988 --> 00:00:23.610
solution vendors and asks them how much they charge to buy their solution in

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:29.014
bulk. He needs this stuff fast. So, he asks how much it would be to get these

00:00:29.026 --> 00:00:33.585
samples rush ordered. Grant takes careful notes when he's on the phone with

00:00:33.597 --> 00:00:38.516
these companies. Once he's done, he has the following information. Brand number

00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:43.463
1 charges $10 per gallon of solution plus a $100 rush order fee. The second

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:48.406
brand charges $8 a gallon plus a $200 rush order fee. And the third brand

00:00:48.418 --> 00:00:53.811
charges $10 per gallon with a $150 rush order fee. Now, Grant has some decisions

00:00:53.823 --> 00:00:58.727
to make. He needs to figure out how much solution he needs to buy and who he

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.982
should buy it from.
