The answer is the one-time pad.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If you can figure out a way to use any of these others to also do it,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
please post that in the forum, but certainly the easiest way to do this is to use a one-time pad.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Remember that to keep property we have with the one-time pad

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is that we can split a message into two pieces and XOR them to get the message back.

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's what we're going to do here.
