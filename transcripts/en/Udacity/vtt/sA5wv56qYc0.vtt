00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's look into measurements, and they will lead to something called "Bayes Rule."

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You might have heard about Bayes Rule before.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's the most fundamental consideration in probabilistic inference,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but the Bayes Rule is really, really simple.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Suppose x is my grid cell and Z is my measurement.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Then the measurement update seeks to calculate a belief over my location

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
after seeing the measurement.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
How is this computed?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Well, it was really easy to compute in our localization example.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now I'm going to make it a little bit more formal.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It turns out that Bayes Rule looks like this.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That will likely be a little bit confusing,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but what it does is it takes my prior distribution, P(X),

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and multiplies in the chances of seeing a red or green tile for every possible location

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and out comes, if you just look at the denominator here,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the non-normalized posterior distribution we had before.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Recognize this? This was our prior. This was our measurement probability.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If we do this for all the grid cells, so we put a little index "i" over here,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
then just the product of the prior of the grid cell times the measurement probability,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which was large if the measurement corresponded to the correct color

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and small if it corresponded to a false color.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That product gave us the non-normalized posterior distribution for the grid cell.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You remember this because that's what you programmed.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You programmed a product between the prior probability distribution and a number.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The normalization is now the constant over here--p(Z).

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Technically, that is the probability of seeing a measurement devoid of any location information.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But let's not confuse ourselves.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The easiest way to understand what's going on is to realize that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
this is a function here that assigns to each grid cell a number,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and the p(Z) doesn't have the grid cell as an index.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
No matter what grid cell we consider, the p(Z) is the same.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Here's the trick.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
No matter what p(Z) is, because the final posterior has to be a probability distribution,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
by normalizing these non-normalized products over here,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
we will exactly calculate p(Z).

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Put differently, p(Z) is the sum over all i of just this product over here.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This makes Bayes Rule really simple.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's a product of our prior distribution with a measurement probability,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
which we know to be large if the color is correct and small otherwise.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We do this and assign it to a so-called non-normalized probability,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
which I'll do with a little bar over the p.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Then I compute the normalizer, which I'll call "α," is the sum of all these guys over here.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Then I just normalize.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
My resulting probability will be 1/α of the non-normalized probability.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.221
This is exactly what we did, and this is exactly Bayes Rule.
