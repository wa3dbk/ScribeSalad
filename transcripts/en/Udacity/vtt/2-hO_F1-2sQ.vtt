00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.736
So now you've seen what kind of function we write using Python to increase the

00:00:04.736 --> 00:00:09.214
value of any input number by 2. In other words to make the output value be 2

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:14.190
grater that the input value. Now maybe you can create your own function. Can you

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.630
design a function that will take some sort of input and then of the output, be 3

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.905
lower than that. Let's see, a logical name for this function then would be,

00:00:24.905 --> 00:00:30.210
decrease by 3, and once again I'm going to call the input x. I'll type in the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.667
return for you. What I'd like you to do is to fill in what you think belongs

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:41.674
right here. What general expression representing the output belongs here if our

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:46.140
input is x and we want our function to decrease the input by 3.
