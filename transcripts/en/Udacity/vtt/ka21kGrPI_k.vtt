00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.580
So for the VLIW let's discuss the good and the bad sides of it.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.670
Among the good things is that the compiler does the hard work.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.920
Because the compiler is run only once and then we run the program many times

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.130
the compiler can have plenty of time to figure out a good schedule. In contrast,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.690
in an out of order processor we have very little time to come up with a decent

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.450
schedule because any time we spend figuring out the schedule is the time

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.100
we're adding to the program execution time. The VLIW processor typically will

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.570
have simpler hardware than a comparable out of order processor.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.880
A VLIW processor can be more efficient than an out of order processor because

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.560
the hardware had less to do per executed instruction. And the VLIW

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.030
processors typically work really well on loops and so called regular code,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.580
where regular code is basically things like sweeping to arrays,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.750
multiplying matrices, and other things that a compiler can easily figure out and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.350
then schedule well around it.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.760
The bad side of VLIW are that latencies of instructions are not always the same.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.580
The compiler has to assume some sort of latency in order to schedule code well,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.380
but sometimes the latencies cannot be determined exactly. So

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.700
for example, we can plan for a load to have a cache hit latency but

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.090
then when it has a cache miss suddenly there is a much longer latency than

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.250
the compiler planned for. Second, many applications are irregular,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.024
almost every application that does a lot of decision making, like for

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:31.550
example A.I. applications, applications that work on pointers or pointer

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.290
intensive structures and so on, are very hard for the compiler to figure out.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.900
And finally there is the code bloat issue. We have already seen in our quiz,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.330
that the code for a VAW can be much larger than the code for a normal,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.240
out of order processor. Because we are inserting a lot of NOPs to prevent things

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.820
that are dependent on each other from being in the same large instruction.
