The answer is setOnItemClickListener. We should register

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.980
an OnItemClickListener with the list view via the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.440
setOnItemClickListener method. Then, when an item in the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.831
list view is clicked, the callback is invoked.
