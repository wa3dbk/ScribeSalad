00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.609
So now you're going to go ahead and

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.420
create the new composite indexes. So first of

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.940
all, open datastore-indexes-auto.xml. You may find it's blank.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.690
You may find it's got some content in it

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.730
already. Either way, it's fine. Then, run the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.330
query on localhost. Then go back to Eclipse

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.620
and check the datastore-indexes-auto.xml file and you should

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.560
find that the new composite index has been automatically

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.090
added to it. Now that you've updated the

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.310
index file, go ahead and deploy your app

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.740
to appspot. In the developers console, go ahead

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.453
and look in the Index Viewer. Is your

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.430
new composite index preparing? You might find that

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.500
it's already ready and that's just fine if

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.340
it is. When your index is ready, run the query and make sure that it works.
