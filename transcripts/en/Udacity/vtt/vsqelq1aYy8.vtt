00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.323
&gt;&gt; Let's visualize what we did here. We have a bunch of data values and we found

00:00:05.323 --> 00:00:10.954
the mean, let's say it's here. Then we found the distance between each value and

00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:16.311
the mean and then squared them. This is essentially the area of every square

00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:21.938
whose side length is the distance between each value and the mean. So we all of

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:28.386
these squares and the sum of squares is basically the sum of the area of each

00:00:28.386 --> 00:00:34.834
square where each distance is Xi minus X-bar and each area is Xi minus X-bar

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:41.534
squared. So then we find the average square. So the average square might be

00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:47.925
something like this size, let's say. In this case, the dimensions are in

00:00:47.925 --> 00:00:54.770
dollars. So the area of this square would have units of dollars squared. So, how

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.319
do we convert this back to just dollars? Take the square root, divide by 2, or

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.636
subtract one dollar sign?
