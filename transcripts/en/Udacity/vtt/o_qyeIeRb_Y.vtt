00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.320
All I'm doing here is looping from 1930 to 2015 in increments of four.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.370
This says start at 1930, increment in steps of four and

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.830
stop once you reach year 2015.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.500
Inside this loop, rather than just adding every year.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.140
Remember, there wasn't a World Cup in 1942 or

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.990
1946 because of World War II, so we want to exclude these years.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.200
And for every year that's not 1942 or 1946, add it to our array.
