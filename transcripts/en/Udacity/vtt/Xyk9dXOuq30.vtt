00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.930
Next, we will discuss strategies for allocating space on

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.020
mass storage devices to a file. Just like caches

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.480
work in terms of units of cache lines or

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.330
cache blocks and virtual memory works in terms of pages,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.410
file systems work in terms of blocks also sometimes

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.240
called clusters. In the case of a disk, a

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.360
block address would need to identify the physical location.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.610
There are different vocabularies here. We'll refer to platter, track

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.600
and most specifically, sector. The block address identifies the

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.880
starting sector and the block itself might cover several more

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.060
sectors, all blocks are of the same size. There are

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.680
several strategies for keeping track of which blocks are free

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.450
and which are used, one easy way is to keep

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.560
a list of free blocks. Another is to use a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.610
bit vector where each bit indicates whether a block is

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.320
free or not. There are more complex strategies as well.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.970
Which is more appropriate will depend on the strategies for

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.820
assigning new blocks to a file as it grows. We won't

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.900
go into those details here. Instead, we will focus on

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.209
how a file system keeps track of which blocks belong to

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.360
which files and of the ordering of these blocks within

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.030
the file. Ideally, we would want a file system that allows

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.490
for simple and fast creation and deletion of files. The

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.710
simplicity here will help maintain consistency in the face of crashes.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.570
We want flexibility on size, that is, we ant to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.030
be able to handle file sizes large as well as

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.050
small, and of course we want an efficient use of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.030
disc space, and we want fast access. Sequential refers to reading

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.180
a file in sequence, from start to finish, and random

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.660
access refers to jumping around in a file. Specifically, we'll

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.440
look at the file allocation table strategy, which was widely

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.920
used in the DOS era, and is still used on many

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.730
USB devices. And we'll also look at the extended

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.120
file format, which is the long time Linux standard.
