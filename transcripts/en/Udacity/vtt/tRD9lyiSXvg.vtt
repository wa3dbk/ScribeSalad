00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This course is mostly not going to be about this particular kind of fuzzing.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Rather, the emphasis of the course is more on random testing in the original sense of fuzzing

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which is to say trying to find flaws in software rather than this very specific meaning of fuzzing

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
for penetration testing purposes.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And now one of the challenge problems for this unit is going to involve writing

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
something with more like this kind of fuzzer, but basically mostly we're concerned with

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
random testing sort of in the general software robustness.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Mainly we're concerned random testing as what would be applied to our own software

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
or to software developed by other people in our own organization.
