00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.020
I have a friend that had his own
business for a long time, and

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.930
he didn't have any co-founder and
he made a lot of money.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.390
But one day, he had a new idea and

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.930
he decided to start a new company and
this time with a co-founder.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.180
That was also a co-founder before,
and when they started collaborating,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.170
it was amazing.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.250
All of a sudden they build
the business that grew so

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.090
fast that it diminished
everything they did before, and

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.470
that's my personal opinion,
that it's natural to have a co-founder.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.100
But they prove themselves
as sole founders before and

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.500
they were very successful before that so
everything is possible.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.250
I believe that someone who wants
to do his own business by himself,

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.920
he definitely can do it.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.610
He's probably more loner person.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.460
Thus, they prefer to walk along and
trust mainly on himself.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.129
It's a different, it's a different
social structure, it's a different

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.480
personality and I know a lot of
successful people that did just that.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.499
All people had co-founders
that are not as

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.070
Dominant as them or not not as
important in the company as them.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.600
They have much more A type personality
and they did amazingly well also.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.890
Everybody can succeed
there's no right or wrong.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.060
That's my personal preference.
