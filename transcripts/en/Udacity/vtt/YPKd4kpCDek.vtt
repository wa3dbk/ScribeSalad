00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.814
&gt;From earlier we developed this general equation where we use the coordinates of

00:00:04.826 --> 00:00:09.234
2 points along a line to find the slope of that line. Now the coordinates of

00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:14.262
home are (0,0) and the coordinates of the city Udacity on the map are (200,700),

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.761
not forgetting the scale of either axis. I'm going to pick the coordinates of

00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:23.822
this point to be x2 and y2, and this one to be x1 and y1. Let's plug them in. We

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:29.407
have 700 minus 0 over 200 minus 0. Well that's pretty simple. It's just 700 over

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.622
200. If we cancel out a common factor of 100, we find that the slope of this

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:39.550
line is 7 over 2. Since Garrett really wants to know how to find out the

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:44.821
coordinates of any point along this route, we'll eventually want to incorporate

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:49.341
this slope into an equation for this line, but we're not there quite yet. Great

00:00:49.353 --> 00:00:51.381
job on this really difficult lesson.
