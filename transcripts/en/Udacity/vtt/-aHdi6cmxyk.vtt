00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.270
We begin with a definition.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.240
A flow network consists of,
among other things, a directed graph, G,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.760
and we will disallow anti-parallel
edges to simplify some of the equation.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.870
This is not a serious limitation,
as we'll see.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.870
We'll distinguish to special
vertices in the graph.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.540
A source, typically labeled s.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.018
This is where whatever is flowing
to the network starts from.

00:00:24.018 --> 00:00:28.030
And a sync typically labeled t,
this is where the flow ends up.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.960
We call all other vertices internal.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.050
To keep our equations a little simpler,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.430
we'll assume there are no incoming
edges into s, or outgoing edges from t.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.640
Associated with every pair of vertices
is a capacity which indicates

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.360
how much flow it is possible to
send directly between two vertices.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.100
We will assume that these capacity's
are always non negative integers.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.000
This will make some of the arguments
easier and it's not a serious limitation

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.120
in fact the last algorithm
we see will overcome it.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.440
Also note that if there
is no edge in the graph,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.850
then the capacity is defined to be 0.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.760
That's the flow network,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.670
the flow itself is a function from pairs
of vertices to the non negative reels.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.700
Clearly then, it must be non negative,
and it can't exceed the capacity for

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.720
any pair of vertices.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.630
Also we require that between any two
vertices, at least one direction be 0.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.490
And it doesn't make sense to have flow
going from one vertex to another,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.600
only to send it back again.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.490
Lastly, we require that flow be
conserved at every internal vertex.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.910
We define, f in, to be the flow, into
a vertex, and f out, to be the flow out.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.559
And we require that the two be equal.

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:46.556
So for example, in this node here,

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:53.790
I have 4 plus 2 coming in, and
I have 5 plus 1 going out.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.300
These are both 6, so we say that
flow is conserved at this vertex.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.860
Intuitively, this just means that
internal nodes can't generate or

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.660
absorb any of the stuff that's flowing.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.160
Those are the jobs of the source,
and of the sync.

00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:11.580
The overall value of the flow,
is defined as the flow going

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.664
out of the source, or equivalently,
the flow going into the sync.
