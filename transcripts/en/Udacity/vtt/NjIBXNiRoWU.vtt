00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.020
Okay so, here's my implementation of the function. First what

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.140
we do is we take we, we take this value H,

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.950
which has this format and we split it on commas.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.830
And we take the first part of that we store that

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.210
in val. And we say if H equals make_secure_val of

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.590
val, return val. Val is, is what, is, is the, the,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.430
the s part of what we passed in, and we want

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.240
to make sure that if we run this function on that

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.310
value again, that we get, what we passed in to this

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.640
function. I could've structured this differently. And looked at all of the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.540
parts of h, and then called hash_str again. But if we

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.150
funnel everything through make_secure_val, updates to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.220
this function will be easier going

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.150
forward. So, because I, I have the advantage of knowing if,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.760
what going forward is going to look like. So let's give this

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.395
a test. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to call

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:50.320
make_secure_val on, on some string. So we'll go ahead and give that

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.480
a run. Okay, we've got the string and now I'm

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.482
going to copy this, and we're going to replace this with check_secure_val.

00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:02.392
And we're going to pass in that string, and now we should

00:01:02.392 --> 00:01:05.970
see the output Udacity. And let's see if that's the case.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.600
Yes, we do. Udacity, that works. Now what happens if we if we modify this

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.730
a little bit, you know, we add an extra exclamation mark? And, and I click Run.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.200
We get nothing back because Udacity didn't match

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.270
the hash string. Likewise, if we restore our string

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.160
and we change the hash, I'll just get rid

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.740
of this character, then run it, we still have

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.740
none. And I'll add that, that 2 back and

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.290
run it again just to make sure everything's working,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.770
and we see Udacity. Okay, cool nice work. Let's

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.330
go ahead and use these functions on our program.
