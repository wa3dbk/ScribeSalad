00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.060
So far.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.510
We have been using
a generic UIViewController.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.190
For a playback scene.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.120
You had just set the generic
UIViewController's UIView.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.960
To have a green background.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.820
UIViewController is a great class.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.970
But we cannot add any
code to it directly.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.510
In order to do audio playback.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.910
We need a UIViewController subclass.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.540
That we can add our play by code to.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.560
I'm going to show you how
to create this new class,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.470
which we will call
the Play Sounds View Controller.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.750
With the Pitch Perfect project open in
Xcode, let's choose File &gt; New File.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.650
Select Source under iOS,
and then Cocoa Touch Class.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.050
Click Next.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.900
For the class name,
let's call it PlaySoundsViewController.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.690
Set it to be a subclass
of UIViewController, and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.560
make sure,
also create NIB file is unchecked.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.040
Even though it's written as XIB
we still call it a NIB file for

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.190
old historical purposes.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.200
Make sure the language is Swift and
click next.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.140
Here we can just make sure that
it's part of our project, and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.940
that our project is selected as
the target and click create.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.150
We can see our new
PlaySoundsViewController.swift file in

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.950
the project navigator.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.450
There is one more step.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.080
The storyboard does not know
we want to use this file for

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.200
the second view controller.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.480
Let's walk through changing that.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.480
Open the main doc storyboard, and
select the second view controller scene.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.850
Be sure to click on the orange
view controller circle.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.010
Open the inspectors panel by clicking
on the top right button here.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.810
Select the identity inspector
as the third one from the left.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.890
In the drop down for the class let's
select, play sounds view controller.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.630
Press Return for it to take effect.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.620
That's it.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.940
Now storyboard knows to use our new
play sounds View Controller class

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.250
instead of just a generic
UI View Controller.
