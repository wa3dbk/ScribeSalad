00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.290
In the networking code, you may have
noticed that there are different types

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.750
of exceptions, but
you didn't know what they're for.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.500
Now we haven't formally talked
about them, so let's do that now.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.080
The first time you saw and exception was
in the first course in the nano degree

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.670
when we were building
the Just Java coffee ordering app.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.740
Now the app ran into an exception and
crashed.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.340
To debug the program,
we opened up the Android logs

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.000
to reveal the stack trace and
then discovered an IllegalStateException

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.790
was thrown when the submitOrder method
could not be found in the main activity.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.700
Let's look at some
documentation about exceptions.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.220
When the Java method fails, or
runs into an unexpected state,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.570
it can throw an exception,
short for an exceptional event.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.020
Exceptions are basically errors,
but they're also captured or

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.430
wrapped in actual instances of the
exception class, which holds information

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.090
about what went wrong and what was
happening in the system at the time.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.250
If you look here on the left for

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.130
example, you'll also notice that there
are more specific types of exceptions

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.209
that actually extend from
the Exceptions super class.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.760
A great example of inheritance
in use in the Java framework.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.800
In other words,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.380
all of these specific classes are
subclasses of the base class Exception.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.820
For example,
here we have an IllegalStateException or

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.780
a NullPointerException.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.710
We also saw the SecurityException
earlier in this lesson,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.970
when the Internet permission was
missing from our Soonami App.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.959
Now you could create a new exception
class for your own purposes.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.727
For example, we can create
an InvalidEarthquakeException and

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.350
define it as we normally would.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.720
Create a custom class and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.160
then have that custom class just
extend from the base Exception class.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.910
&gt;From there, we can customize
the Exception to hold say,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.190
very specify information about
an invalid earthquake scenario.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.900
So as a developer you can write
a method that declares that it will

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.400
throw an exception.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.220
Meaning that the code inside that
method either one, generates and

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.100
exception to indicate
a unique condition, or two,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.050
and more commonly,
calls a method that throws an exception.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.840
Meaning that the Android runtime tried
to execute some code, but ran into

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.460
a problem and therefore gave notice of
the problem by throwing the exception.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.850
It's also important to note that if
an exception is thrown, it also means

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.640
that the code following the line that
caused the exception won't get executed.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.000
So how do you do this in Java code?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.890
There are two distinctions that
I'd like you to pay attention to.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.049
Number one, anywhere in your Java
code where you want to cause or

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.294
invoke an exception,
you use the key word throw.

00:02:35.294 --> 00:02:36.916
Like in this example here,

00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:41.010
where we want to throw an
InvalidPurchase Exception(); because we

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.760
detected that something went wrong
within our completePurchase() method.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.380
Number two, and
this is much more subtle.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.940
Anytime our code throws an exception
that isn't a descendant of the error or

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.920
runtime Exception classes, we must
explicitly declare in our method's

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.350
signature that our method
could throw such an exception.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.120
In Java programming speak,
this is known as a checked exception and

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.120
has the implication that any code
that calls or uses our method

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.440
must handle the exception i.e.,
call our method in a try block.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.660
This is enforced by the Java compiler,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.740
in other words whoever calls
the completePurchase method has to have

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.480
a backup plan if the InvalidPurchase
Exception is thrown or occurs.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.960
We'll talk about how to handle
exceptions in the next video.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.790
In case you'd like to learn more about
unchecked versus checked Eeceptions

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.040
in more detail, see the tutorial
linked in the notes below this video.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.790
One more important note.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.700
Just because there's
a standard framework for

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.000
how to use Exceptions in Java,
it doesn't mean that you should throw

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.870
exceptions every time
something goes wrong.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.130
This is where developer
discretion comes into play.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.260
Ideally, if we discover a problem or
a unique situation, we should try and

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.190
handle it gracefully in code.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.680
By just falling back to some reasonable
default behavior for example, and

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.200
continuing executing if possible.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.810
We call this failing silently.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.680
However, should we deem that it be more
detrimental to keep going with an error

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.030
state, then we may decide it's best to
notify our calling code of the error

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.770
by throwing exception.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.050
We've seen this in play already.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.459
In the case of our Soonami App, when we
tried to request earthquake data from

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.040
the internet, the Android framework
code threw a SecurityException.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.660
This is a case when it's better
to throw an exception and

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.860
crash the app as opposed to continuing
without the Internet permission.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.610
Now if the Android framework
code had failed silently,

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.560
then we as developers would
probably be super confused

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.600
as to why we did receive
response from the server.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.010
In the case of the Soonami and
Quick Report Apps, we won't actually be

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.210
creating our own custom exceptions or
throwing exceptions intentionally.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.620
We will however be calling the Android
framework code that does throw exception

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.330
and we'll need to handle those
exceptions appropriately.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.340
Let's talk about that next.
