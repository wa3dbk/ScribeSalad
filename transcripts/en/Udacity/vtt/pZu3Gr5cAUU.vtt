00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.432
Our degrees of freedom are the sample size minus one plus the other sample size

00:00:04.432 --> 00:00:10.406
minus one. Or we can just add them and then subtract two. So we get the degrees

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:15.755
of freedom is 16 in this case. Let's bring up our t table. When the degrees of

00:00:15.755 --> 00:00:20.165
freedom is 16, and we have 0.025 in each tail, since we're doing a two-tailed

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:27.086
test at alpha equals 0.05. Then we get that the t critical value is 2.12. Since

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:31.798
our t statistic is less than the t critical value, that means it falls in the

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:38.238
middle of the distribution. 0.96 is maybe about here, whereas the t critical

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:44.253
value is out here. Therefore we'll accept Ho. Based on our samples, there's no

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:48.474
significant deviance that we would predict between the number of pairs of shoes

00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:51.380
owned by males and females.
