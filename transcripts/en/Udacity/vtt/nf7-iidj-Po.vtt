00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And now this is the interesting insight here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The maximum height of the search tree is K

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Why is that?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Well, we just noticed that each time we go 1 level deeper in the search tree,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we add at least 1 vertex to the vertex cover.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If the graph is supposed to have a vertex cover of size at most K,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
then the maximum number of levels that we can go down here is actually K levels,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so for the decision variant, what we have here

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is that the height of the search tree is no longer in half,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but it's actually bounded by K,

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and K is the size of the vertex cover that we're looking for.
