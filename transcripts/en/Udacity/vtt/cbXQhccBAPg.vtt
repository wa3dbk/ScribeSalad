00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.620
This lesson will get you familiar with

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.840
app building and some of the basic functionality

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.550
of the sales first platform. Now Samantha and

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.380
Andy will introduce you to the problem we'll

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.410
be focusing on in the class. As you listen to their discussion, pay attention to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.720
the questions they ask each other. How would

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.810
the questions they're considering generalize to other problems?
