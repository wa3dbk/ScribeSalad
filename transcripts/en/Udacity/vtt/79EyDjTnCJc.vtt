00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.009
In the previous video,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.180
we introduced Hoeffding's inequality, which puts a probability bound on

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.640
the amount by which our estimate of beta will deviate from the actual value.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.540
We saw that this bound is actually a function of

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.370
the number of data points that we have.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.950
So, let's try to apply that to our own problem, and

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.510
try to find a confidence bound for our beta parameter.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.518
Recall that the beta value that came out of our exponential fit

00:00:24.518 --> 00:00:28.720
was 1451.5 seconds.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.900
Let's used Hoeffding's inequality to put a 95% confidence

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.540
interval around this value.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.795
So, first let's recall the number of data points we have is approximately 3200.

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:46.722
So, what we want is for the right side of this expression to equal 5% or 0.05.

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:51.081
So specifically, if you solve this expression here for

00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:54.988
Absalom, you get a value of about 0.0240.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.020
Now, what does this mean exactly?

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.128
That means,

00:00:58.128 --> 00:01:04.340
this interval traps the true value of data with a probability of 95%.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.350
So, if we're going to use this exponential to predict the amount of

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.110
time to wait until this person Tweets next,

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.120
the best that we can say is that it lies somewhere within this interval
