00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:03.300
So this burst utilitzation, as Stratton and Company call it,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.783
is usually the most critical factor to optimize for global memory performance

00:00:07.783 --> 00:00:12.115
and that's where the examples of a ray of structure, the structure of a ray comes in.

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:16.586
But there are also subtler issues like partition camping that can occasionally rear their heads.

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:20.094
So as before, I'll use the ninja icon to indicate topics

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:24.029
that the average GPU programmer probably won't need to concern themselves with.

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.264
Now a more sophisticated example of the data layout transformation technique

00:00:27.264 --> 00:00:32.441
is something called the array of structures of tiled arrays, or ASTA.

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:35.184
This technique can address issues like partition camping

00:00:35.184 --> 00:00:39.378
and can potentially achieve even better bandwidth utilization on a wider range of architectures.

00:00:39.378 --> 00:00:43.000
So you'll find a reference in the supplementary materials.
