00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.560
Well, I'm sold.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.650
Libraries are great.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.440
There are certainly some
downsides to be aware of.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.662
By definition,
a library is reusable and generic.

00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:12.450
If it custom built for you app,
it would be easier to call it your code.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.300
That means that libraries may
include more than what you need and

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.940
bloat what could be a lean app, or
maybe not even cover the cases you need.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.860
And of course,
libraries are built by developers and

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.610
that means there may be bugs,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.620
architectures that don't work well with
your existing app, or trade-offs such as

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.100
quality versus memory consumption that
you might not be able to control.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.460
In addition,
not every library ages gracefully.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.620
They may not be taking
advantages of the newest API's,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.280
hampering your ability to build
the best user experience.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.760
Or they may have been
abandoned entirely,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.810
leaving you stranded when
faced with an issue or a bug.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.930
Goes to show picking the right library
might be the most important step.
