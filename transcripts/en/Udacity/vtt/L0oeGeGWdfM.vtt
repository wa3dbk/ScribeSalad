00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.024
The two patterns that we just found are actually called perfect square

00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:08.786
trinomials. They're called this because we can represent the binomial squared as

00:00:08.786 --> 00:00:13.459
a perfect square. When we multiply out the binomial, we'll get the trinomial, a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.542
squared plus 2ab plus b squared. The only difference between the two patterns is

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:23.497
the plus sign and the minus sign, which also appears here in the second term.

00:00:23.497 --> 00:00:27.719
The second term is positive 2ab with the first one, and negative 2ab for the

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:32.046
second. Let's see if you can use these patterns to answer our next question.

00:00:32.046 --> 00:00:35.925
