00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.955
What we need to see here in the graph is a bunch of triangles. So, if we let

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:08.160
each side length, or each of these distances that we're looking for, be the

00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:12.400
hypotenuse of a right triangle, then we can as we've done so many times before,

00:00:12.497 --> 00:00:16.855
use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of that side. Conveniently, since

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:20.897
we're using graph paper, made up of these little tiny squares, we have right

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:24.731
angles all over the place. That made drawing these right triangles super simple.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.430
If you look at the opposite ends of one of these side lengths, we can just draw

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:32.131
lines along the lines that are already given to us by the graph paper. And the

00:00:32.143 --> 00:00:35.884
intersect to help us form the right triangle. Then, we just need to figure out

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:39.924
the length of each of these legs for each of these triangles. Let's look at leg

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:44.623
AB as an example for how to deal with the other three triangles on here. We need

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:49.074
to find out the length of either of the two shorter legs in order to find out

00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:53.343
the hypotenuse. So, we could just count one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:00:53.446 --> 00:00:58.133
Seven is the length of this side. We'll do the same thing for this side. This is

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:03.046
five. In looking at this modified version of the Pythagorean theorem, we can

00:01:03.058 --> 00:01:07.981
just say that the length of AB, this hypotenuse, is the square root of 7 squared

00:01:07.993 --> 00:01:12.753
plus 5 squared. Simplifying that gives us the square root of 74. Once we find

00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:17.613
the lengths of the legs of all of the other right triangles, calculating their

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:19.726
hypotenuses is also easy.

00:01:19.727 --> 00:01:26.427
And so, at long last, here are our final answers. The length of AB is the square

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.818
root of 74, BC, square root of 180, CD is the square root of 40, and DA is the

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.403
square root of 130.
