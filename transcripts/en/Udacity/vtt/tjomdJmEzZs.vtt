00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.500
So, here's the Python Standard Library. Now, if I scroll

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.810
down a bit, I will come across a set of

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.520
functions called the Built-In Functions. If I click on them,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.690
I'll find a bunch of functions which are always available

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.440
in Python. And one of those functions is open. If

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.020
I click on open, the documentation says that it opens

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.230
a file. Which is exactly what we did in our

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.330
program. And if I go on to read, it suggests

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.730
that open returns an object of the file type. Now this word object is extremely

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.560
curious. Where have we come across this word object before? let's investigate.
