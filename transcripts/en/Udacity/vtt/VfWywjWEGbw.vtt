00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.421
First, we distribute a negative 1 to each of the terms, and change their signs.

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:08.447
Next, we identify the like terms. And finally, we combine the like terms

00:00:08.447 --> 00:00:12.918
together. Throughout the problem, I just kept my 4m to the 5th. And my negative

00:00:12.918 --> 00:00:17.236
5m to the 4th. These didn't have like terms. But I need to make sure I list them

00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:21.680
in my answer. Negative 5m cubed and negative 5m cubed make negative 10m cubed.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.800
And positive 3 and negative 3 make 0. So here's my answer.
