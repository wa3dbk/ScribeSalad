00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.158
Okay let's see out memory ordering quiz solution,

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:06.681
this load is still sent to memory in

00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:09.378
cycle 1, and will come back in cycle

00:00:09.378 --> 00:00:13.452
41. The store, however, cannot proceed fully because we

00:00:13.452 --> 00:00:18.919
don't know what the value is until cycle 42 ,So in cycle 42, this store finally

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.614
figures out what the address and the value

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:25.330
are, so now this load can be considered done.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.310
Because we need to do things in order, that means that only cycle 43,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.373
this load can start going to memory, It's going to take 40 cycles to come

00:00:35.373 --> 00:00:41.020
back, so in cycle 83 the value comes back from memory; at that point.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.942
This store can finish at cycle 84, inside cycle 85

00:00:45.942 --> 00:00:50.650
that means that only then this load can go to memory,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.502
It's going to be cycle 125 by the time, it

00:00:54.502 --> 00:00:58.354
come back and finally the final store can be

00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:02.160
done in cycle 126. As you can see, it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.840
took almost three times as long in this case

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.870
to do this as it did when we were trying to do things out of order. So there

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.960
is a huge advantage in trying to reorder load

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.820
store instructions, but it caries a risk of having

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.020
to recover from basically loading the wrong value from memory

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.930
because we should have loaded the value from the store.
