a whole new approach to building software applications.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.360
Providing some of the flexibility that comes with building your own solution

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.790

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.620

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.600
the design thinking that goes into many future development projects.
