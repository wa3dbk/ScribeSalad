00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.370
So I'm going to call my main
function Island Counter and

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.800
I'm taking in the matrix here.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.280
Now what I first want to account for
is the none.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.262
So if my matrix is equal to none or

00:00:18.262 --> 00:00:25.513
if it is equal to the anti matrix.

00:00:25.513 --> 00:00:33.957
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:33.957 --> 00:00:36.535
In this case I just want to
return zero right way.

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:40.708
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:45.385
Now if this is not the case,
I'm just going to initialize my

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:50.700
islands variable to 0,
which is the number of islands.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.200
And I'm going to want to do two for
loops to loop through this.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.962
So I want to know the number of rows and
columns.

00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:08.962
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:18.130
So this is actually going
to be vice versa here.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.494
Okay, so I'm going to write my for loop.

00:01:22.495 --> 00:01:32.495
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:53.650
Now when I get here, I want to check
if the element is equal to one.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:03.650
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:05.586 --> 00:02:10.148
And if it is,
I'm going to increment my islands count.

00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:16.457
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:18.520
So now what I need to do here,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.790
is I need to do the breadth first
search I was talking about before.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.403
So I'm just going to have
a helper method to do that.

00:02:24.403 --> 00:02:32.891
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:34.284
Call it find points of island.

00:02:34.284 --> 00:02:44.284
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:47.420
So I'm going to go ahead and
define that down here.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.920
OK.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:57.920
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.211
So the first thing I want to do
is I want to initialize a queue.

00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:16.685
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:19.330
&gt;&gt; Why did you choose a queue?

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.700
&gt;&gt; Since we're using
a breadth first search here,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.570
I want to be able to use a queue so that
I can get the first element in the-.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.620
When I add an element to the queue,

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.690
I want to be able to get
the first element that I added.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.429
&gt;&gt; And I actually need to
import this method here and

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.478
this is from the collections framework.

00:03:40.478 --> 00:03:42.914
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:03:42.914 --> 00:03:43.712
&gt;&gt; That's a good catch.

00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:53.712
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:58.657
&gt;&gt; And then the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to

00:03:58.657 --> 00:04:01.245
append my Indexes here so
I know the locations.

00:04:01.245 --> 00:04:06.711
So I'm going to pin these to my queue.

00:04:06.711 --> 00:04:16.711
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.820
And now I'm just doing
a breadth first search here, so

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.683
while it's empty, we're going to keep
searching for other things around.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.724
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:31.490
So while the length of the queue

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.658
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:36.658 --> 00:04:38.629
Does not equal 0.

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:45.160
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.520
So what I want to do here is I want to
look at the elements around it.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.490
So you mentioned before that I needed
to check if they were actually there.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.438
So I'm going to write a helper
method to do that, too.

00:04:58.438 --> 00:05:01.816
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:05.270
Okay, so
now that I'm checking if this is empty,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.180
I want to do something
with this element here.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.930
But it looks like I'm
running out of space, so

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.800
I'm just going to draw
a little arrow over here.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.970
And just cut this little section
off here that I'm going to be using

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.229
to finish this method here.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.750
So what I want to do is
I want to be able to

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.400
get this element here from-, let me
make sure to go up a little bit higher.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.136
So I want to pop this
element off the cue.

00:05:34.136 --> 00:05:39.749
And then I want to be able to
access these two variables,

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:44.280
so I'm just going to
set them to a new one.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:54.360
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.489
Okay.
So now that I'm here,

00:05:56.489 --> 00:06:00.410
I want to check if this
element is equal to one.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:10.960
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.416
And if it is, I want to set it
to two as I mentioned before.

00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:21.420
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.630
So I'm going to use a helper method
right here to check if these

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.920
elements that are next to it,
actually next to it.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.220
And then if they are,
I'm going to add it to the queue.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.599
So, I'm going to call that-

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.851
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:40.900
Set up more space here.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.680
So this method is
going to be called append

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.507
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:49.700
If.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.320
And I'm passing in the queue.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.441
And I also need

00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:57.568
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:06:57.568 --> 00:07:01.159
The row, column, and

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.463
both of these coordinates here.

00:07:06.463 --> 00:07:07.820
Okay.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:13.356
So what I want to check
here is if the x value

00:07:13.356 --> 00:07:18.431
is greater than or equal to 0, or-.

00:07:18.431 --> 00:07:20.320
I mean not or.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.971
And.

00:07:20.971 --> 00:07:23.934
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:07:23.934 --> 00:07:30.686
It is less than the number of columns,

00:07:30.686 --> 00:07:37.438
and if y is greater than or equal to 0,

00:07:37.438 --> 00:07:44.406
and if y is less than
the number of rows.

00:07:44.406 --> 00:07:48.735
And then if all those
conditions hold true,

00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:54.300
what I'm going to want to do
is append this to the queue.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.168
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:07:58.168 --> 00:08:01.221
there, and so I'm going to want
to append this right here.

00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:06.988
And just to make sure I'm
appending it the right way so

00:08:06.988 --> 00:08:12.500
I access the first element,
I want it right here.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.280
So my helper method's going to work.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.900
So after I do all of that there,
method here.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.969
I'm running out of space right here.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.531
So all this information here is just
basically I'm calling this method on all

00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:23.698
the elements around it.

00:08:23.698 --> 00:08:27.897
So I'm going to append

00:08:27.898 --> 00:08:31.241
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:32.681
If.

00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:33.885
And so
what I need to do is pass the queue.

00:08:33.885 --> 00:08:39.860
Rows, columns, and
what I'm going to do is x plus 1 and y.

00:08:42.308 --> 00:08:45.170
So it's going to be the elements
to the right of it.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.682
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:08:48.682 --> 00:08:52.629
And then this is going to
be the element below it.

00:08:52.629 --> 00:09:01.793
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:09:01.793 --> 00:09:03.100
So left.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:13.100
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.276
And on top.

00:09:21.276 --> 00:09:22.780
That looks like it.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.110
Well, that went pretty smoothly.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.510
&gt;&gt; Yes it did.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:32.260
After going through all the necessary
steps before coding the solution,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.800
the actual coding is a lot easier than
if he were to have just jumped in and

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.770
coded from the beginning.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.699
&gt;&gt; The interviewee also made sure
to let the interviewer know what

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.560
he was doing when he was coding.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.810
But he didn't read out all of
his code as he was coding.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.550
We often see interviewees just reading
out their code as they code which can

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.859
get annoying and does not really build
understanding with the interviewer.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.900
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.420
This interview, we focused more on
explaining the purpose of the code

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.000
while he was writing.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.630
By talking out loud, you give your
interviewer the chance to jump in and

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.620
help if your logic is wrong.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.400
You also proved to your
interviewer that you're actually

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.520
thinking through all of your code.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.490
If you just write code you might be
spitting out a memorized answer.
