00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.940
Udacitask1.0 was a hit, but

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.060
list making applications are evolving,
and so has Udacitask.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.060
You now want Udacitask 2.0 to support
a variety of item types, text, quotes,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.940
lengths, tasks,
calendar events, you name it.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.302
For this project you are going to focus
on completing a prototype of Udacitask

00:00:20.302 --> 00:00:25.570
2.0 that will support three item types,
tasks, events, and links.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.690
But you want to keep in mind that
Udacitask 2.0 could support 10 or

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.170
20 item types some day,
organization is key.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.970
Keeping your code scalable and

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.900
organized gets much harder as
your projects get more complex.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.140
So it's best to anticipate
these challenges early on.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.280
In this project you will refactor and
expand on Udacitask with modules,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.850
while using Gems and Bundler to improve
your desk task style and functionality.
