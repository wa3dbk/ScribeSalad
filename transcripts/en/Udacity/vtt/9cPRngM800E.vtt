Thank you for sharing your responses. I

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.750
will be providing feedback on the forums periodically.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.640
Now there are several ways in which to solve this problem. One way is for us

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.090
to write a program that somehow keeps track

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.270
of time, say two hours, and it essentially

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.010
does nothing during that time. So the first thing we want the program to do is

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.930
Wait for two hours.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.930
And after we've waited for that amount of time, we

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.790
want the program to open up a web browser, which

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.330
plays let's say a YouTube video which is your friends

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.670
favorite song. So the second thing is to open a browser.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.940

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.870
Now because we want these two steps to happen multiple times

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.850
during the day. Because we want to take multiple breaks during the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.430
day. We want to put these two steps inside some sort of

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.310
loop. So let's say we want to repeat these steps three times.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.060

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.300
Let's build this. I encourage you to follow along.
