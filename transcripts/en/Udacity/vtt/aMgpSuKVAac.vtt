00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.508
Let me show you an interesting application of random numbers. You know what pi

00:00:03.508 --> 00:00:06.816
is. It's the area of a circle with radius one, and of course, there are

00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:12.190
formulas for computing pi to any desired precision, but that's no fun. We'll

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.000
compute pi by shooting darts. Specifically, we'll throw random darts into the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.812
square. Most of the time we'll hit the circle, sometimes we'll miss, and the

00:00:21.812 --> 00:00:25.966
ratio of the hits over the tries is going to be approximately the same as the

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:32.880
area of the circle, over the area of the square. The square has side lengths 2,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.815
so that's 4, and the area of the circle is of course the desired pi. So how do

00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:44.896
we do this in Java? We generate a random x between minus 1 and 1. A random y

00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:49.420
also between minus 1 and 1. Compute the distance from the origin and if that

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.470
distance was at most 1, then we had a hit. If that distance was larger than 1

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.350
then we didn't have a hit. So go ahead and complete the program that does this.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.256
The biggest challenge is to get the x and y to be random values between minus 1

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:06.260
and 1. Because nextDouble gives you values that are between 0 and 1. So you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.769
will need to be creative to adjust this range to the one that you want.
