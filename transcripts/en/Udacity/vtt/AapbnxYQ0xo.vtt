&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We've learned a lot of methods to solve systems of equations. We looked at

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:07.616
graphing, substitution and elimination. I hope you've gained a greater

00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:11.654
appreciation of how to solve these problems. With each of these methods there

00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:15.711
are some advantages and some disadvantages. When solving try and think about

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:17.738
what would work best for each problem.
