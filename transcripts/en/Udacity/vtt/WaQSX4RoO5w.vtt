00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
So in the last unit, we talked about the simple algorithms

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.190
for our three problems that have to go through an exponential number of solutions

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.900
to try all possible assignments of 0 and 1 to the vertices.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:21.260
And now I haven't told you yet what this super powerful computer down here in the left corner

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.840
is actually capable of and the ability that this computer here has

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.820
is that it can help us figure out the best possible 0 and 1 assignment to the vertices

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.250
without actually going through them.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.470
And the way this computer can help us is that it has a special instruction that a normal computer

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.990
or even the RAM model does not have and that instruction is called if-better.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.040
And I'm going to explain to you in a second what that means.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.170
So the if-better function basically works like a normal if-else instruction on the RAM.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.580
So the normal if-else instruction is if this part here which I haven't specified yet is true

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.950
then this part of the code not yet written is executed and otherwise this part down here is executed.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.780
The second property is that calling the if-better function will cost us polynomial time.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.280
So a normal if-else on the RAM just costs one time step or constant time

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.420
and calling this function here will cost polynomial time.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.620
And now here comes the special property of this function.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.250
Normally when you have an if, you would have to specify some condition here so that

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.910
if the condition is satisfied this part of the code is executed.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.300
And if it's not satisfied, then this part here is executed.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.740
Now the if-better is a function that will figure out by itself if it's better for us,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.140
and I'm going to show you in a minute what I mean by that,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.290
if it's better for us to execute this part up here or this part down here.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.270
It will always, if you will, guess correctly which part of the code to execute.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.940
Now, the first time you hear this, it takes a bit getting used to.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.190
So let me give you one example for our vertex cover how we could use this powerful function

00:02:02.190 --> 99:59:59.000
to solve vertex cover almost trivially.
