00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.310
As our builds become increasingly more
complex, we want to ensure that we don't

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.720
redo any work that has already been done
the last time we executed our build.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.980
This is especially important
during development,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.700
when we run our builds often many times
a day with just some minor changes.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.160
It would be a huge impediment
to the development process

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.570
if our build had to start
from scratch every time.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.080
We call the idea of only doing
the minimum amount of work necessary

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.840
incremental builds.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.240
For example,
let's consider an Android application.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.390
Building our app requires compiling
our code, generating source files, and

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.370
packaging static resources
into the final APK.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.470
If we were to say,
change one of our layout files,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.670
we don't want to have to
compile our code again.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.150
That would be unnecessary.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.890
Gradle accomplishes this by tracking
each task's inputs and outputs.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.620
Before each task is run, Gradle saves a
snapshot of the inputs used by the task.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.460
If that particular task doesn't have
any snap shots of its input yet, or

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.120
if the inputs have changed,
then Gradle will run the task again.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.269
Gradle additionally saves a snapshot
of the outputs created by this task.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.530
The next time Gradle goes
to run the same task,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.550
it compares the inputs to
the snap shot it saved earlier.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.390
If the inputs match,
Gradle then also checks the outputs.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.850
If the outputs haven't been messed
with since the last time the task ran,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.670
then the task can be skipped.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.700
If the outputs have changed or are
missing, then the task must run again.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.230
When Gradle determines that
no work needs to be done and

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.424
the task can be skipped,
the task is said to be up-to-date.
