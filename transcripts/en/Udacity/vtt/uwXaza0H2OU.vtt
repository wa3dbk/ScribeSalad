00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's write a function to solve the missionary and cannibals problem.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It takes a start state.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here's the normal problem: 3 missionary, 3 cannibals, and 1 boat on the start side.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Nothing on the other side, and it takes a goal state.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The goal state is not specified. It's just the opposite of that--3, 3, 1 on the other side.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Nothing on the original side.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The state is this 6-tuple, and we're trying to find a path from the initial state to the goal state.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In fact, we're trying to find the path with the least number of steps.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm not going to ask you to do this as a quiz.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If you're enthusiastic, you can stop the video now

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and go ahead and solve it on your own, but now I'm going to go ahead and show it to you.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Here's a solution that looks pretty much like the pouring water problem.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We check to see if the goal is None, then we fix up a nice goal.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We check to see if we've accidentally already reached the goal at the start.

00:00:52.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Then we just search for the shortest path.
