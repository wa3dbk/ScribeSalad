00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.460
Let's do some coding to get an idea
of what professor just explained.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.260
Starting with defining our symbols list,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.320
having symbols like SPY,
XOM, GOOG, and GLD.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.710
We then move ahead to
build our dataframe

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.910
df just like we did in
couple of lessons before.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.390
So df is our final dataframe.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.210
Now let's start computing statistics.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.090
First we compute mean.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.240
We need mean of stock prices for
each symbol.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.380
And dataframe.mean will do this for us.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.740
As professor explained,
it computes mean for each column.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.270
And our columns denote one stock each.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.470
So we get mean for
all stocks in just one line of code.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.040
So to compute the mean, we just called
the name of the data frame df.mean.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.078
Let's check the output.

00:00:49.078 --> 00:00:55.530
Note how Pandas prints the mean for
each symbol properly labeled.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.570
Also, here's the graph with all
the symbols and their data.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.170
Similarly, we can compute median and
standard deviation.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.590
Let's do it.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.340
We compute the median of the data
frame by calling the median function.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.430
Remember the difference between
the mean and the median.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.140
Mean is the average of a set of values

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.200
that is the total sum
divided by number of values.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.220
Whereas median refers to the value in
the middle when they are all sorted.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.950
Now let's try standard deviation.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.490
We compute the standard deviation
by calling the function std

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.920
over the data frame.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.850
Let's check the output.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.980
Mathematically, standard deviation
is the square root of variance.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.770
But more intuitively, it is a measure
of deviation from central value.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.070
Here, the central value is the mean.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.000
A higher standard of
deviation like here for

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.540
Google indicates that the stock
prices has varied a lot over time.
