00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.370
We've seen a variety of graphics and their visual encodings up to this point.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.470
But we haven't discussed which of these is most effective.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.440
How should we know whether to encode a quantitative variable,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.170
in color saturation, or rather than, say, position?

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.430
Fortunately, some passionate researchers have answered this question for us.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.800
In a 1985 paper, William Cleveland and

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.720
Robert McGill share the results of a series of experimental user studies.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.520
These studies were designed to compare the effectiveness of

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.890
display elements like position, length, angle, and others.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.600
They were trying to see how effective using codings were in terms of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.840
users being able to interpret quantitative information,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.290
that is exact numbers from the graphs.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.510
This paper was the first of its kinds to validate the ranking of

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.890
encodings using, empirical evidence and as it

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.000
turns out position along a common scale is the most accurate of the encodings.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.180
Color saturation or density on the other hand was less accurate.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.670
For the Gat Minor visualization, this is why the most important variables,

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.070
Income per person and Life expectancy were encoded using position.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.480
It's the most accurate of the bunch.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.060
The key takeaway here is that if you want to design effective visualizations,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.260
then you need to understand the rankings of visual encodings and

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.530
choose appropriate encodings in your designs.
