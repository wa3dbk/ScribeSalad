00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.530
Okay. So let's talk about another type of queue

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.460
called pull queues. This queue solves another kind of

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.380
problem. Let's say that you implemented a site that

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.810
requires humans to review comments. So the users of the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.560
site generate comments and these comments need to be

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.200
reviewed before they are published. Similarly to push queues, you

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.640
could create a queue. And then insert comments to

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.700
be reviewed into this queue as tasks. And external people,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.700
well in our case robots, could review the comments, perhaps

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.600
working from home in their spare time. So you have

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.110
your queue where you add comments as review tasks. Then

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.970
the different people would pull a review task from the queue

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.860
and work on it. So let's look at the difference

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.780
with push queues. Well in this case, App Engine is

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.380
not executing the tasks. They are instead executed by the

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.730
external workers. You can say that the task is pulled from

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.650
the queue by the external worker. That's why they are

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.950
called pull queues. The tasks that are pulled from the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.360
queue are leased by the external workers. The worker must

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.250
complete the task within the lease time in which case it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.130
can be deleted. But if the task is not completed

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.790
within the lease time, it is automatically returned to the

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.520
queue. If we compare a pull queues to push queues,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.300
the differences are. So pull queues do not have a URL,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.860
since your code is not completing the task. Each

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.100
task is leased by a worker for a certain

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.750
amount of time. A worker must delete the task

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.510
when it's completed, otherwise it is returned when the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.400
lease expires. External workers pull the queue using a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.540
REST interface. And there is no default queue for

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.840
pull queues, so you need to explicitly create them.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.040
That's it for pull queues. Let's have a quiz.
