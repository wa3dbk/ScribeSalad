00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.006
I've run through the basics of what the vertex and fragment shaders use for

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.590
inputs and outputs. Say you have a triangle with a shading normal stored at

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.734
each vertex. Which of the following are true? The vertex shader can output the

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:14.092
average position of the three vertices. The fragment shader can use the

00:00:14.092 --> 00:00:17.356
interpolated shading normal. The vertex shader can output a color for the

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:21.316
fragment shader to use. The fragment shader can use the position of the third

00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:24.719
vertex in the triangle. Check the box if this statement is true.
