Hi there.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.090
Welcome to this LinkedIn lesson.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.950
I'm Victoria and
I'm a project manager at Udacity.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.940
In this lesson, we'll be covering
how to transform LinkedIn from yet

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.690
another tiresome job material into
a creative platform to tell your

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.310
professional story.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.059
We'll focus on both the big themes and

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.380
the tiny steps to boost your
professional online presence.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.450
Based on our experience and the research
we've done with hiring managers and

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.090
recruiters, we'll cover
the purpose of LinkedIn and

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.770
provide you with tips on how to use
the platform to your greatest advantage.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.320
Specifically, this lesson will detail
the different components within

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.410
a LinkedIn profile, and
the best practices for each.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.990
We'll also provide you with
a strategy to connect with others

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.500
within your network.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.580
Don't have a Linked In profile or have
one and for less than excited about it.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.300
By the end of this lesson, you will
have completed Stella LinkedIn profile.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.060
You should also be feeling more
confident that your online presence

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.680
conveys an accurate depiction of your
professional experience and goals.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.410
So, how do you currently feel
about your LinkedIn profile?

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.720
What is one thing you like about it and
one thing you'd like to change?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.990
Feel free to post your
responses in the forum.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.990
Ready?

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.640
Let's get started.
