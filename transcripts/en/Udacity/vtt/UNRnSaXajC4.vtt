00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.290
In the last lesson,
we focused on access control, but

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.990
in particular what we called
discretionary access control.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.760
The idea there is that access
control is about checking

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.648
if the source of a request should be
able to gain access to a resource.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.450
We know that who the user
is because user comes and

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.648
authenticates himself or herself.

00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:22.240
So in discretionary access control,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.850
we said whoever creates the resource
is the owner of that resource.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.810
So the owner can also selectively
grant access to other users.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.260
For example, Bob may both be able
to read and write, and Charlie

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.910
can either read or write or maybe just
has read access or something like that.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.090
So the idea of a discretionary
access control model is

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.710
that resources have
owners who are users.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.520
And these owners get to decide,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.530
it's at their discretion, who else
should be able to share these resources.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.880
In this lesson, we're going to examine
if this model has any limitations or

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.980
any problems.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.830
Are there situations where it's
not going to do the job for us?

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.940
And if that is the case, then what other
kind of models do we need to develop

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.140
to meet those applications, or

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.240
those needs that arise when
we talk about access control?
