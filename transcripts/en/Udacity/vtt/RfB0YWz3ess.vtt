00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.680
So, we know this trinomial can be factored like this. And now, we want to see if

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.615
we can continue factoring this inside trinomial. So, if we wanted to continue

00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:12.725
factoring, which number should we use in our number puzzle? One of these numbers

00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:17.034
will be the top number, and then one of these will be the bottom number. Choose

00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:18.653
one from each row.
