00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.696
Let's look at the solution to our
consistency quiz where we have coherent

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:09.620
memory but an out-of-order pair of
cores, where branches are predicted,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.029
stores are still done strictly
in program order, but

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.994
loads can be reordered and
these two variables start at zero.

00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:21.574
What the programmer is kind of expecting
to happen is that I put put some values

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:25.095
in some data, then I set a flag,
and the other core waits for

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:28.840
that flag to be set so that it can
print the data that I produced.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.111
In program order, the only thing that
can really happen, is that we print 15.

00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:38.989
In the execution order,
that can also happen.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.335
If this core gets to this part
before we even start checking,

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:47.766
we might compute 15 in the data,
set flag to one, core one,

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:52.220
loops here, sees that the flag is one,
exits, brings 15.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.980
So, clearly 15 is possible.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.850
But the question is can
we get anything else?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.390
These are done strictly in order so
if anything else does get printed, it's

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.970
not going to be because this core did
the data right after the flag was set.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.170
The flag actually gets set after
the rights are complete but

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.120
here's what can happen.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.130
This loop here amounts to reading
the flag, testing if it's zero,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.970
and then branching based on that.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.520
This processor can easily predict
this branch in a way that says

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.590
we exit before it even gets
to check what the flag was.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.710
So at that point we will be here and
we will fetch the data to be printed.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.490
The data at that point might be zero.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.860
So what we do is we predict it goes out
and we fetch the data at this point.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.450
So it's kind of step one predict,
and leave loop.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.920
Step two, read the data, and
it's zero at this point.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.210
Then let's say core 2 finishes this, and

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.550
at that point out-of-order
processor does this load, remember,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.330
these are load,
they can be re-ordered, if we do this,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.170
we see that the flag at this point
is one so prediction was correct.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.170
And at this point,
we can print the data that we found.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.900
In this case, we will print zero.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.308
A similar outcome is possible for
data = 10, simply by moving this here.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.628
So, we can also print ten
if access number two,

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:30.539
which reads the data after the
prediction of the branch happens here.

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.985
And finally we could get 15 and
the data if we get it here, but

00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:35.920
we already knew we could get 15.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.870
Note that it's not possible
to get five or anything else.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.185
And the reason is that these writes on
the same core will happen in program

00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:44.687
order.

00:02:44.687 --> 00:02:48.560
It's incorrect for
a core to somehow read zero here.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.370
because the only way we read data here,
is if it was already written here.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.160
On the same core,
we have to obey the program order.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.280
That was never in question.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.420
So the data when it's
read here has to be 10.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.780
We can only increment it by 5 to 15,
we cannot read 0 here.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.140
So that's why it's possible
only to get 0, 10, or 15.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.870
So basically, the real problem is
that somehow, although we thought

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.780
we are waiting for the flag to be set
before we access the data, in reality we

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.610
managed to access the data at kind of
any point before the flag was set.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.900
And coherence, again,
didn't prevent this.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.220
What we need is consistency.
