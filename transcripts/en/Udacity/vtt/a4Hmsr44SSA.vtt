Good job.

00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:03.825
Now, as we noted before, loading an image is comprised of three steps. We

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:07.450
actually declare a new image object, then, we specify the function to be called

00:00:07.462 --> 00:00:10.850
when the image has been loaded and finally, we set the source of the image

00:00:10.862 --> 00:00:15.240
itself. Down here, we specified our onImageLoad function, which simply prints out

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.175
a statement to the console alerting us when this image has been loaded.
