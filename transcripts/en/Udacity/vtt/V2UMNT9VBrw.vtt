Now queries in monodb are based on the document model

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.730
as well. In order to find items of interest, we

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.130
want to specify a document that resembles those we're looking

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.750
for. So let's take a look at an example with

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.460
the autos data set. If we want to find all

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.770
autos that have a manufacturer of Toyota We construct a

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.840
query document like this. The general principle here is that

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.170
we construct the query document, having the fields and values for

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.490
those fields that we'd like to see in every document

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.350
in our results set. One additional thing I'll point out

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.650
here is, that we're simply looping through our results and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.290
printing out each one of them. Okay let's run this.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.210
Okay, so we can see that in the documents

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.860
we got back, we have a manufacturer value of Toyota.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.400
And if we were to scroll through this entire result

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.280
set, we'd see that all of them in fact do.
