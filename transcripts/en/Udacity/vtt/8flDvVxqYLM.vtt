00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.275
Well, first of all, this prompt doesn't match what we want the user to do

00:00:03.275 --> 00:00:07.115
anymore. That's a bit better. We also need to check more things about the

00:00:07.115 --> 00:00:12.834
value. If it's too low or too high, we keep asking. Too low would be that value

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:18.892
is less than zero. And too high would be if the value is greater than 100. If

00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:22.430
either of those is true, we want to keep going. Let's test this out and make

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.276
sure that the edge cases work well too. It's asking me to enter an integer

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:30.958
between zero and 100 inclusive. If I enter something like 101, it'll keep

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:35.592
asking. That's good. Now, if I enter something like negative one, it still

00:00:35.592 --> 00:00:41.079
keeps asking. That's also good. But it should accept zero and 100. Looks like

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.389
it accepted zero. Let's try running it again. Will it accept 100? Looks like it

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:50.609
accepted it. So this was the correct condition to check the user's input.
