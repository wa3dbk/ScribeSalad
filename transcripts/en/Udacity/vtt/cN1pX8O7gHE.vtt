00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.000
Both of these middle graphs show loudness decreasing as distance increases.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.270
This one shows loudness as a constant. It doesn't change at all as distance

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.198
changes. And this one shows loudness increasing as distance increases. So

00:00:14.198 --> 00:00:15.670
neither of those is right.
