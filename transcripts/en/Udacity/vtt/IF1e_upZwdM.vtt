00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.403
&gt;From here, solving for x is pretty simple. What I would like you to do next is

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:07.777
collect all of the terms with variables, so all of the terms with x, on the left

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:11.914
side of the equation, and all the terms with constants on the right side of the

00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:15.786
equation. So, please use paper and pencil to do this. In fact, I'd like you to

00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:19.554
use paper and pencil to solve all of these equations and write out all the

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.868
steps. And you can either choose to combine like terms on either side of the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.138
equation or you don't have to if you don't want to. And last but not least, I

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.004
would like you to fill in your final answer for x in the bottom box.
