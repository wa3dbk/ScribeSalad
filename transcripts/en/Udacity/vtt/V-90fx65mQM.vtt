00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.200
So in a typical TCP three-way handshake, the

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.180
client sends a SYN packet to the server,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.260
the server responds with the SYN-ACK, and the

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.915
client then returns with an ACK to the

00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:15.130
SYN-ACK, at which point the connection is established.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.070
The problem in a typical TCP three-way handshake

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.130
is that. The client can send a SYN and cause the server to allocate a socket

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.350
buffer for that TCP connection. But then if

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.190
the client never returns, the client can force

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.610
the server to allocate many, many socket buffers,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.910
simply by sending a lot of syns and never

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.090
returning. In fact, these could even be from

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.330
spoofed IP addresses. So in other words, the client

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.430
has absolutely no accountability, and no obligation to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.590
return to send the final ack, and yet can

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.670
cause the server to allocate resources. This is a problem, and the solution to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.030
this is called syn cookies. In the

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.140
TCP syn cookie approach, when the server receives

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.080
a syn from the client, the server, instead of allocating a socket buffer for the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.470
tuple associated with the connection. The server

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.840
keeps no state, and instead picks an initial

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.060
sequence number for the connection that's a function of the client's IP address,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.800
and port, and the servers IP address, and port, as well as a random knots to

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.670
prevent replay attacks. An honest client that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.440
returns can then reply with an acknowledgement

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.720
with that sequence number in the packet.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.400
The server can check that sequence number simply

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.280
by rehashing all of the information that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.610
it already has. Thereby determining that the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.820
acknowledgement here corresponded to the previous SYN-ACK

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.050
that it had sent the client without

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.210
requiring the server to store any state. Only if the sequence number matches the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.415
one picked by the server in the

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:05.790
syn-ack does the server actually establish the connection.
