Ultimately however, we're not interested in whether a particular Turing machine

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.189
recognizes or decides a language. Rather, we're interested in whether there

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.880
is a Turing which machine that can recognize or decide the language. Therefore,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.990
we say that a language is recognizable if if there is a Turing machine that

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.790
recognizes it. And we say that a language is decidable if there is a Turing

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.050
machine that decides it. Now looking at this someone might object, shouldn't we

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.060
say recognizable by a Turing machine and decidable by a Turing machine

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.090
well of course we could and the statements would still be true. But we don't.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.990
And the reason we don't is that we strongly believe that if anything can do it,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.870
a Turing machine can. That's the Church-Turing thesis. So

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.810
as it's absolute sense, we believe that a language is only recognizable,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.840
by anything, if a Turing machine can recognize it. And the language is

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.340
only decidable, by anything. If the Turing machine can decide it.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.400
And we use terms that reflect this belief. Now other terms are sometimes used,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.110
instead of recognizable and decidable. Some say that Turning machines compute

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.150
languages, so to go along with that, they say that languages are computable,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.030
if there's a Turing machine that computes them. Another equivalent term for

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.270
decidable is recursive. Mathematicians often prefer this word.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.340
And those who use that term, will refer to recognizable languages,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.880
as recursively enumerable. Some also call these languages Turing acceptable, or

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.150
semi or partially decidable. We should also make clear the relationship between

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.840
these two terms. If a language is decidable, then it's also recognizable.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.780
The same Turing machine works for both. It feels like it,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.370
it should also be true, that if a language is recognizable and its complement is

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.070
also recognizable, then the language is decidable. This is true,

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.670
but there's a potential pitfall here that we need to make sure to avoid
