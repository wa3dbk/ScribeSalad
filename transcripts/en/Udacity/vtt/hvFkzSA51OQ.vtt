Let's take a look at some other images. Here I have some circles. I've already

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.166
written the fractions below each circle. I want you to check the images that

00:00:08.178 --> 00:00:12.303
have the same shaded area as the one over here. Check the circles that have the

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:13.157
same area as one-half.
