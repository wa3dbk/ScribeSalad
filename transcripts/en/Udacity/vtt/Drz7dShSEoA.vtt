00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.864
For this one, I think we should use elimination. If I multiply the first

00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:10.176
equation by positive 2, I could wind up with a positive 12 x, which would be the

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:15.047
opposite in sign of this negative 12 x. This would let me eliminate the x

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:19.965
variables. 2 times 6 x is 12 x. 2 times negative 5 y is negative 10 y. And 2

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:24.302
times positive 3 is positive 6. So, I have the new first equation, and then I

00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:28.333
just rewrite my second equation right under it. So, elimination would probably

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.952
be the best here. We choose elimination over the other two because, with

00:00:31.952 --> 00:00:35.734
substitution, we don't have any single variable solved for. And I know if I

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:39.721
solve for these variables, I'd have to divide by coefficients, like 12 or 10.

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:43.627
That could create fractions in my substitution, which would make my math more

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:47.533
complicated. I know graphing would be more difficult, too, because I would

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:51.315
either have to create tables, or solve these equations for y and put them in

00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:52.477
slope intercept form.
