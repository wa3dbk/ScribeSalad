00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.959
Let's talk about the information we get from the problem. We see that the line

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:09.703
has a slope of 5, so that means m equals 5. The fact that it goes to the point

00:00:09.703 --> 00:00:14.631
2, 3 means that x1 equals 2, if we're using the variables from the point-slope

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:19.297
form equation, and y1 equals 3. Now we just need to insert these into the

00:00:19.297 --> 00:00:22.573
equation. We get y minus 3 equals 5 times x minus 2.
