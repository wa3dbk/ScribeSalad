00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:07.166
And as I said, this is a bit subjective. I think for x1, it's kind of very clear that this variable actually has to be set to true.

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:12.832
And the reason is the following: If you look at all of the clauses here, they are connected by "and"s.

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:20.132
So, if one of these clauses here becomes false, the whole Boolean formula here is also set to false.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:28.166
Now, here, x1 is in a very lonely position, so to say, because x1 makes up a whole clause.

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:34.432
So if we set x1 to false, then this formula here, the whole formula here will also become false.

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:43.032
So it's clear that x1 has to be set to true, and it's also easy to see that, because the variable just appears once.

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:48.866
And this can be done in polynomial time; it's rather easy, because you just go through this whole Boolean formula here,

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:52.132
or an algorithm could do it, then it finds a clause with just one variable.

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:57.632
And it knows if you have a clause with just one variable, then it's immediately clear how you have to set this.

00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:02.866
So for example, if we had not x1 here, we would also know that we would have to set it to false.

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:08.666
So what's the other variable where I think that it's rather easy to see if it should be set to true or false?

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:17.732
Well, x2, if you look around it--so here's x2, here's not x2, not x2, not x2. So it appears a couple of times.

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:24.299
It appears as x2 and as not x2. So without trying any other assignments, I think it's not that easy to see.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.266
X3 is the same. So here we have x3, here we have not x3, here again we have x3, not x3.

00:01:31.267 --> 00:01:38.599
That's also not easy to see. So what about x4? Well, the thing with x4 is this variable appears only once; namely, here.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.066
There's no x4 anywhere else. And that is why, in my opinion, it's very easy to see what to do with x4.

00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:50.399
The thing that makes SAT hard is when variables appear in different forms, right?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.699
So it appears here as x1, and here it appears as not x1. So if we set x1 to true, this clause here becomes satisfied.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.832
But we get one less variable to satisfy the clause over here.

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:09.666
And vice versa: If we set x1 to false, then this clause here becomes satisfied, but we get one less variable over here

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:15.032
because x1 is now set to false, so we have to either set x3 to true or x5 to true.

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:21.599
So if a variable appears just once, we have nothing to lose; we can just set x4 to true, satisfying this clause here,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.499
and it has no secondary effects on any of the other clauses.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.632
And of course, an algorithm could also do this very easily. The algorithm just looks at each variable

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:35.066
and counts how often does that variable appear? And if a variable appears just once, it knows how to set it.

00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:40.299
So here we have x4, we would set it to true. If we had not x4, we would set it to false.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.432
So let's try a bit more challenging example, actually. We have found two very easy pre-processing rules for SAT.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:52.766
If there's a clause with just a single variable, and of course if the Boolean formula is written in conjunctive normal form,

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:57.966
then we know how to set that variable. And second pre-processing rule that we found out for x4:

00:02:57.967 --> 00:03:04.999
If a variable just appears once in a whole formula, then we also know how to set that variable.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.933
So now let me give you one more example, which is going to be a bit more challenging.
