00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.330
Most modern malware use packing, and

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.580
there are many packing tools
we call packers available.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.400
There are many,
many ways to obfuscate malware code.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.010
Furthermore, there are hundreds of
thousands of malware samples released to

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.600
the internet every day by attackers and,
like I said, most of them are packed.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.620
This means we cannot manually
analyze all the malware samples.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.600
Instead, we need automatic approach to
unpack malware and analyze malware, and

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.320
such approach has to be universally
applicable to all the malware samples.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.580
An approach that we can take,
is to combine static and

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.990
dynamic analysis to do
fine grain analysis.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.310
In particular, with static analysis we
look at the packed malware code, and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.230
we get a set of instructions
in the packed program.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.140
And then, we run the malware, and

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.090
the dynamic analysis, we can
identify instructions that are not

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.360
in the statically identified
set of instructions.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.990
Meaning that, these are new
instructions that we did not see in

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.520
the packed program.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.490
These must be instructions that have
been unpacked just before execution.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.100
In other words, by identifying
instructions that we can only see one

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.840
time, we have identified part of
the program that had been packed.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.240
Once we identify the unpacked code,
we can then apply other anti-malware

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.880
techniques, including signature
scanning, to identify the malware logic.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.190
For example, even though after packing,
each malware instance looks different,

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.340
the malware code,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.020
meaning original instructions,
once unpacked remain the same.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.170
Therefore, after unpacking, we can still
use a signature to identify the malware.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.660
For example,
the instructions that have been packed

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.920
can be the logic that the malware
uses to do key logging, and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.260
a signature base approach can
identify this part of the malware.
