For pairs of sets of data, like we have in this situation, there's a special

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:08.132
sort of notation that we use to help us get ready to graph. So, in this column,

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:12.256
I have a set of values that d could equal. And then, in the column next to it, I

00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:16.221
have a set of values that n will equal, whenever d equals the values to the

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:20.274
left. To show which values in either column fit together, I write them inside

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:24.345
parentheses together with a comma in between. The reason this helps us with the

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:28.422
graphing is that traditionally, the number that comes first corresponds to the

00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:32.094
horizontal value, or the horizontal coordinate of the point that we're going to

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.346
draw. And the number that comes next corresponds to the vertical value of the

00:00:36.358 --> 00:00:41.110
point, or the vertical coordinate. So, thinking about how ordered pairs

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:46.270
translate into graphing, where does the point 5,115 belong?
