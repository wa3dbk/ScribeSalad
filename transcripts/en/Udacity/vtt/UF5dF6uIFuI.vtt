Maybe you have the stereotype that women don't like hockey. Well I'm here to be

00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:09.070
the exception to the rule for your stereotype, because I love hockey. Wait, let

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.886
me clarify that. I'm a Detroit Red Wings fan. That's right, I have only one

00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:16.370
team that I'm in favor of, and that's the Detroit Red Wings. Now when I was

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.458
living in Michigan in the Detroit area, I would run into other Red Wings fans

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:23.876
all the time. Everywhere we went somebody had on a t-shirt, they had on their

00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:28.422
hats. They had on their jerseys. And it was awesome. But now that we're talking

00:00:28.422 --> 00:00:31.315
about the Red Wings, that's going to bring us to our next topic. Let me set the

00:00:31.315 --> 00:00:35.376
scene. Throughout the years as a Red Wings fan I've had the great opportunity

00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:40.700
to watch my team win multiple Stanley Cup championships, and it's been awesome.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.820
And throughout those years we've also seen a few pesky teams that prevented my

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.845
team from moving forward in the playoffs. One of those teams was the San Jose

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:51.510
Sharks. Now, I really had no opinion of them other than that they were a team

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.595
that sometimes got in the way. Fast-forward a few years and I find myself

00:00:55.595 --> 00:01:00.683
living in enemy territory with the San Jose Sharks and their fans. It turns

00:01:00.683 --> 00:01:04.282
out, unfortunately, that a lot of the fans don't like the Red Wings, or Red

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:09.732
Wings fans. Now, how do I know that? I know because I've experienced first hand

00:01:09.732 --> 00:01:14.199
what it's like to be treated as an outsider. I'll never forget the time when I

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:17.301
finished teaching my general psychology course, ran down to my office, and put

00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:22.426
on my Wings gear, and went down to catch the bus to watch the game. I got on

00:01:22.426 --> 00:01:27.195
the bus, and I realized that I was in a sea of teal, all Sharks fans. And

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:31.144
immediately they all started booing me. Some people had some off color remarks

00:01:31.144 --> 00:01:36.068
about my team. And they were yelling me go back to Detroit. Well, I can tell

00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:38.966
you from that experience it was obvious that I was a part of the out group, and

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:43.756
not a part of the in group. As you can imagine, the bus ride was a little

00:01:43.756 --> 00:01:48.797
uncomfortable. There were a few people who were kind of nice to me. I think

00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:52.083
they felt badly because I was getting picked on, but for the majority of the

00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:56.822
ride people were booing me. Here's the interesting part. When I got to the

00:01:56.822 --> 00:02:01.005
arena I saw a lot of Detroit Red Wings fans. They were wearing their jerseys,

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:05.186
had their hats on, and we smiled at each other, we high five. We yelled, go

00:02:05.186 --> 00:02:09.299
wings, and here I had total strangers, but I felt a part of that in-group. And

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.295
I did not feel a part of the San Jose Sharks, that would be the out-group.
