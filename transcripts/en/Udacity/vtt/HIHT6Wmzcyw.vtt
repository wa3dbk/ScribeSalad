00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:50.789
about. &gt;&gt; That sounds right David. There are sort of several other things to

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.930
note here. What is the last sentence that has two verbs in it? Decided and

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.030
go. You'll see in a minute, how we can deal with sentences or

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.450
stories that have multiple verbs in them. Second, you are right in

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.940
that it is not always very easy to decide which is the best primitive action for

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.940
capturing the meaning of a particular verb here.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.300
So the verb here was pushed, and the reason David propelled or

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.340
moved object is because in propulsion the body is in some sense in

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.990
contact with the particular object that is getting moved. Now we are not sure

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.880
inherently detailed specification of each of one of these primitive actions. But

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.790
I can tell you that the readings at the end do give them in detail
