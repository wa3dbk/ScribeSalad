00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.480
The end of this string is at the point 40, 30, and the link to this string is

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.235
50 centimeter. Great work if you found these two answers. Now, for the end of

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:15.389
the string we just want to have a coordinate pair. The x distance is 40 units

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.024
or 40 centimeter, and the y, or vertical distance is 30, 30 centimeter. The

00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:27.992
length of this string is actually the hypotenuse of this right triangle. So we

00:00:27.992 --> 00:00:32.930
can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the length of the string. We'll

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.890
have a squared, which is 30, plus b squared, which is 40, equal to c squared,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:47.050
our hypotenuse. When we square these two numbers we'll get 900 plus 1600. Then

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.426
when we sum these numbers we will get 2500 equal to c squared. Now we just want

00:00:53.426 --> 00:00:58.360
to take the square root of both side of our equation to solve for c. Taking the

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.960
square root of both sides, will only keep the positive root, since we're

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.562
dealing with a distance, so c equals 50 centimeter. Now the much faster

00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:11.468
approach, to solving this, would be to understand that we have a 3, 4, 5 right

00:01:11.468 --> 00:01:18.440
triangle. The ratio has just been multiplied by 10. So, this side is 30, this

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.949
side is 40. And this length of our string, is 50 centimeters. If you solved it

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:28.710
using that 3, 4, 5 ratio, amazing work.
