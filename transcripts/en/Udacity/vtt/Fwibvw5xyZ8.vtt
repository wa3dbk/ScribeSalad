00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.000
So we have one logarithm set equal to another logarithm, and they have the same

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.867
base, this means we can set. These two arguments are numbers equal to one

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:14.750
another. So what do you think are the values of x? Maybe there's two. Maybe

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.284
there's only one that will work for the original equation. Or maybe none of

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:22.610
them work and there's no solution. Type your answer in here.
