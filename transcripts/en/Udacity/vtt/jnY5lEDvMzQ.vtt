Here I've written just 1 last Python program.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You've mastered all the others; this one should not be too tricky.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I have this procedure, tsif, and if our magical procedure says that it halts,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
then we take this then branch.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Otherwise, we take this else branch.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 lines long.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What I'd like you to do is check this box if halts (tsif) returns True

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and check this other box if halts (tsif) is False. Check all that are true.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It should be relatively direct, a 50-50 chance even if you're guessing, right?

00:00:33.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Try it out. Give it some thought.
