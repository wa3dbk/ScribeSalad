Pattern finding, just like we did in the last quiz is a big part of what makes

00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:09.350
math so interesting. Now that we know that each day we make 23 more units total,

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:14.134
what's the best way to find out how many we'll have by the end of day 14, which

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:18.732
is when the expo is? Should we complete the table down to 14 days? Should we

00:00:18.744 --> 00:00:23.697
find a mathematical relationship between days and total number made? Or, last

00:00:23.709 --> 00:00:27.706
but not least, should we make an estimate about how many wipers will be made by

00:00:27.718 --> 00:00:31.516
the end of day 14? This a little bit subjective, and more than one of these

00:00:31.528 --> 00:00:35.058
might actually work, but please pick what you think would be the most.
