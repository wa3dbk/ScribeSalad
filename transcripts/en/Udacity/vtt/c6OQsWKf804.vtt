00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.794
So we all know that we encounter stressful situations throughout the day, week,

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:08.154
and even our lifetime. In fact, throughout one day we may experience different

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:12.502
levels of stress. For example, perhaps you oversleep and you're going to be

00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:16.082
late for work. Or you're stuck in traffic and you're going to be late for an

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:21.466
exam. Even worrying about a sick pet can cause stress. You might find it

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.651
interesting to know however that not all stressful events are threatening or

00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:29.392
bad or frightening. In fact some events that are supposed to be pleasurable or

00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:34.290
fun can also produce stress. To that end in the 1960s two psychologists

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.792
invented a scale called the social readjustment rating scale. And we're going

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:41.690
to go back to Lauren to look a little bit more closely at that scale.
