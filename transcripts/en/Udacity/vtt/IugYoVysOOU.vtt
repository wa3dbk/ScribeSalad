00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.608
First, we subtract 6 from both sides, so I'm left with negative 3 x, make sure t

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.298
carry the negative sign down with the term and negative 30 on the right. Here's

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.815
where I want to be careful. I'm dividing by a negative 3, the coefficient in

00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:18.291
front of x. When I divide by a negative, my in equality sign must flip over, or

00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:22.996
reverse direction. So, x could be any number greater than or equal to 10. Just

00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:27.447
like with equations, we can check to make sure if we are right. Let's plug in

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:31.980
any number greater than or equal to 10 into our original inequality to see if

00:00:31.992 --> 00:00:36.556
the condition is true. I'm going to plug in 10. And when I do that, I can see I

00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:41.089
get negative 24 is less than or equal to negative 24. That definitely checks.
