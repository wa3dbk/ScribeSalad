00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.220
One of the main things you
get out of using Analytics

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.080
is that you can see which parts
of your app your users are using.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.950
When auto-tracking is enabled,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.610
Analytics tracks usage of all activities
that are ended on the screen.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.160
Analytics uses the term,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.110
screen to mean an activity
that's displayed on the screen.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.520
So here, this activity is rendered
as the Show Dinner screen.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.740
You can name the screen specifically, or

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.590
you can let Analytics use the activity
class name as the screen name.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.050
Here's what it looks like, if you
use the class names as screen names.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.550
But here's how it looks,
if you assign you own screen names.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.570
You specify screen names in
the tracking config file by using,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.850
you guessed it, a screen name tag.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.950
The name attribute is actually the name
of the class, complete with package.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.850
It's not the name that shows
up in the Analytics dashboard.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.320
The value of the tag is the name
that shows up in the dashboard.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.370
Here we've got, Show recipe.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.520
And here we've got, Show recipe.
