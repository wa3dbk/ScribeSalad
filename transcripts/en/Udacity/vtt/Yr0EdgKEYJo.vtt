00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So this completes this unit. Congratulations! I'd say this was nontrivial.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I didn't derive every piece of math for you. But you've learned a number of things.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If X is normal with parameters µ and σ², then aX+b will yield parameters aµ+b and a²σ².

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You also learned if you combined X and Y, that the combined thing adds up the means

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in this case two µ's and adds up the variances as well.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So we did some very basic math on normals.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We got a feel for how they changed as we turned them into problems and manipulate them.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'll leave it at this. This was possibly the most insightful and deep probability consideration.

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You now go back to statistics, and we worry about confidence and other things.
