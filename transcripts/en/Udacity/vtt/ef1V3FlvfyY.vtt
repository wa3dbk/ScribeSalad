00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The next concept I want to talk about is conditional probability.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is the one we're going to need to use to prove that the one-time pad is perfectly secure.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Here's the definition of conditional probability.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If we have two events--we'll call them A and B--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and they're in the same probability space,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the conditional probability of B given that A occured

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is written like this: it's the probability of B given A--so we use the bar

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to indicate conditional probability--and it's defined by this formula.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's the probability of A intersected with B

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
divided by the probability of A.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
To get an intuition for that, let's look at these sets.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Here's our universe omega. That's all events.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Our question is given that we know A occurred,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
what's the probability of A.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The fact that A occurred means the rest of our probability set doesn't matter.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We're only considering the outcomes where A occurred.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That's the set for A.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We want to know what was the probability that B occurred.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Those are the elements in this intersection--the times when B did occur

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
divided by the size of the sets A,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which is the probability of A. That's the intuition behind this formula.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Let's see if it makes sense for our example as well.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The question is given that we have a valid coin toss,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
what's the probability that it's heads.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'll remind you the model we had.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It said the probability of heads is 0.49999 with four 9s.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The probability of tails is 0.49999.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The probabiilty of edge is 1 minus the sum of those,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
which is 0.00002.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We define valid as the outcomes where it lands on heads or tails not on the edge.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Given that you know a coin toss is valid,

00:01:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what's the probability that the outcome is heads?
