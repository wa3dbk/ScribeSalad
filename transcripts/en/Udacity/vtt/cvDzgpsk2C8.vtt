We've seen a lot of different parabolas in this lesson so far. So I've written

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.457
down the equations for a few of them here, and then also the corresponding

00:00:08.457 --> 00:00:12.845
vertex for each one. Thinking about the relationship between a vertex of each

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:17.267
equation, and the equation itself, could you write an equation in the same form

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:21.808
as these over here? For a parabola whose vertex is at the general coordinates h

00:00:21.808 --> 00:00:26.798
comma k? One more note, for simplicity's sake, assume that this parabola is just

00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:31.653
a shifted version of y equals x squared. The only thing that's different about

00:00:31.653 --> 00:00:35.807
it from this original graph is that the vertex has moved to h comma k.
