00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.533
Eventually, you'll be able to picture this in your head. We know the rise is the

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:08.842
change in the y values. So we went down 3, or negative 3. And then run is the

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:13.253
change in the x values. So we went 3 units to the right, from 4 to 7. If you can

00:00:13.253 --> 00:00:17.882
picture this stuff in your head, that's amazing. If you can't, that's okay too.

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:22.243
Understanding what rise and run mean can really help you understand the slope

00:00:22.243 --> 00:00:22.850
formula.
