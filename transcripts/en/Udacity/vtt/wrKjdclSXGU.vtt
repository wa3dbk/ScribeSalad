00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.880
Hi, my name is Lorenzo.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.620
I'll be your instructor in this
course as we explore the design and

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.120
implementation of web APIs.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.460
Throughout this course, you'll work on
several mini projects that each focus on

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.850
a specific concept you'll learn.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:14.990
At the end of this course,

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.330
you'll use all the skills learned to
create a final object called Meat and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.680
Eat, a social application for meeting
people based on their food interests.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.770
By building the back end of this
application you will gain some insight

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.440
into how these social applications
work underneath the hood.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.000
In addition you will learn some tips
when it comes to designing API endpoints

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.580
for clientside consumption of your code.
