00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:03.910
Back-end programmers often collaborate
with other types of programmers, and

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.250
they work in teams.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.893
Each company and
team will be different, but generally,

00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:11.550
back-end programmers may sync with
front-end programmers to support

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.850
any front-end features
that require storing or

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.890
retrieving data, like someone's name,
birthday, and favorite food.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.155
They may also link with mobile
programmers to make data usable

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.430
in a mobile application.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.980
Finally, they may also connect with data
analysts to create usable structures for

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.630
client data.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.840
Back-end programmers play
an important role in teams.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.300
In the next lesson, we will learn
more about mobile programming.
