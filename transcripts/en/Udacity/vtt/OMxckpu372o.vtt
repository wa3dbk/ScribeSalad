00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.392
Now that the rational zero test has given us eight possibilities for zeroes at

00:00:03.392 --> 00:00:07.666
this function. Why don't we test some of them out? Now, of course, figuring out

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.203
the value of the function at any of these values for x will give us useful

00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:15.000
information. But right now, I'm really only interested in which ones of these,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.150
when plugged into our function, give us f of x 0. Or rather, f of whatever

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.404
value we plug in equals 0. Here's how we're going to go about doing this. I've

00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:27.515
made a list of the values of the function at all the possible zeroes we had,

00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:32.262
and I'd like you to evaluate all of these function values. All you need to do

00:00:32.262 --> 00:00:35.800
for this quiz is, starting at the top of the list, work your way down, and as

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.222
soon as you find a value of the function that equals 0, write a 0 in the box

00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:45.658
next to that value. You can leave all the other boxes blank, and remember, you

00:00:45.658 --> 00:00:50.179
can stop after you have found just one zero. The top most one.
