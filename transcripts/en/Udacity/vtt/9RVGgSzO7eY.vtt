00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.052
We've used the LCD to add and subtract fractions and even simplify complex

00:00:05.052 --> 00:00:10.740
fractions. Let's use this LCD one last time to solve equations like this one.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.164
This is an example of an equation with a rational expressions. These two

00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:19.074
fractions in particular are the rational expressions. We have a polynomial

00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:24.816
denominator here x. And a polynomial in the denominator here, 2 x. Before we get

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:29.238
started solving this equation, let's think about what values of x would not make

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:33.535
this equation true. If x equaled one of these numbers, it wouldn't make the

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:35.889
equation true. Which one is it?
