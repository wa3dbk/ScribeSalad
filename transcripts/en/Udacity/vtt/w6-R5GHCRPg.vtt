I think we're really on a roll with this whole finding inverses thing. So let's

00:00:03.996 --> 00:00:07.582
just keep it up. In fact, I'd like us to start with the equations that you just

00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:11.196
came up with. The ones that were the inverses of the ones we started out in the

00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:14.951
last quiz. I'm going to give them new names though. So now I'm going to call

00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:20.700
them the functions p, q and r. We have p of x equals x minus 1. q of x equals

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.598
4x plus 9 and r of x equals the cube root of x. What is the inverse of each of

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:27.819
these functions?
