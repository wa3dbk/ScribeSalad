00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's one way to define factorial.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There are lots and lots of ways to solve this, so we're going to define

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a procedure and its input is the number "n."

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What we want to do is compute this functionÃ¢Â€Â”we're going to compute

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
"n" times "n" minus one times "n" minus two.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We are going to need a variable to keep track of the results as we go,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
as well as a variable to keep track of how many times we go.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We're going to define a procedure that computes the factorial of "n."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What we need to do is multiply all these numbers, so we're going to have

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a variable that keeps track of the results so far.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We'll start by initializing that to one, so we'll call that "result" and we'll

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
set its initial value to one.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We're going to keep multiplying by "n" until we get to the end.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We're going to have our "while" loop where the test condition is as long as

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
"n" is greater than equal to one.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We're going to start with "n" as the value that was passed in.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We're going to subtract one each time we go through the loop

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
until we get down to one, and keep updating the result.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The result keeps updating, so we want the result to be the previous

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
result times "n."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We also have to change the value of "n" to keep reducing "n" as we go.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We subtract one from "n" every time through the loop.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The result is multiplied by the current value of "n"Ã¢Â€Â”"n" is decreased by one.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We keep going until we get to "n" is equal to one.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We're not quite done yet.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We want to return a "result," and the value that we want is stored

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in this variable "result," so we "return results" here.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's try that in the Python interpreter.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now we'll see what happens when we have the input 4Ã¢Â€Â”our child

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
playing with the blocks.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We see the results as 24.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
They're 24 different ways to arrange the four blocks.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Factorials increase pretty quickly, so we could also use the factorial

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
procedure to figure out the number of different ways to arrange a deck

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
of playing cards.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If we have a deck with 50 cards, there are 52 ways to pick the first card,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
51 ways to pick the second, and so forth.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
When we run this, we see that the factorial of 52 is this really big number.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
That's why you can have so many different card games.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Every time you play, the arrangement of the cards is going to be different.
