00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.950
Let's get started with
the serial version.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.650
First of all, we have the three
ID actions, synchronousDownload,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.110
this is the first button,
simpleasynchronousDownload,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.940
this is the second button.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.120
And asynchronousDownload.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.840
This is the one that will
use completion block.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.580
So let's get started
with a synchronous one.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.400
And we need to do four steps.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.620
These are the four steps that we need
in order to download this image.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.850
So first of all,
we need to get the URL for the image.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.790
Then once we have the URL, we will need
to obtain the NS data for the image.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.380
And we don't really care for NS data.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.560
What we really need is a UI image.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.720
So we have to turn this
NS data into a UI image.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.410
And finally, we're going to display it.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.330
So, let's just insert the code.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.600
Okay, so this is the source code.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.100
As I said previously,
the first steps you get the URL, and

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.995
there is a catch here.

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:04.810
NSURL may return an.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.860
So, this actually won't be a URL,

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.500
it's going to be an optional
with a URL inside.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.530
Then, we have to turn
this URL in to a NSdata.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.610
We have to fetch this
image from the URL.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.480
And we're using NS data contents of URL,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.650
which only accepts a URL,
not an optional.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.670
So we have to unwrap it.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.040
Once we have the NS data,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.770
we need to turn this NS data into
something that we can use, a UI image.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.560
Again, just as before,
the method that we're going to use,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.060
does not accept an optional.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.150
So we have to unwrap it.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.860
And provide the NSData.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.810
So, this is not very nice,
what we're doing here.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.790
Having all these unwrapping's.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.500
But I want to have it line by line, so
you can easily spot who's the culprit.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.270
Start thinking who might
block In this code.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.060
And last but not least,
we have to display the image.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.090
So, once you have this code written
down, let's run the simulator,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.169
and make sure if it blocks or not.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.790
It should, and indeed it does.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.700
As you see when I click here,
it should just blink.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.080
Instead, it remains inactive for

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.540
a certain time,
while the image is being downloaded.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.990
And while that happens, you can't
do anything, the GUI is blocked and

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.580
it's blocked for
a user perceivable amount of time.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.740
So, congratulations you have just
been rejected from the app store.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.060
We cannot deliver code that behaves
like this, under no circumstances.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.170
Fortunately, after all the wax on,

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.250
wax off of the last lesson,
we now have all the tools to fix this.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.430
However, before we do it in the next
video, see if you can refactor this

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.440
code, and put everything inside
of a single if let statement.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.450
It is not good practice to have all
these exclamation points into your

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.570
Swift code.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.470
And besides, it's also unsafe.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.860
So, before you move on
try to refactor this.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.940
Put it into a single if let statement,
and we'll continue on the next video.
