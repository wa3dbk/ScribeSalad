I have more sugar at home than my recipe calls for. My recipe only calls for 2/3

00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:08.780
of a cup of sugar. If I had 1 cup of sugar at home, I could use 2/3 to make one

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:13.050
full batch of brownies, and then I'd have 1/3 of a cup left over. So, I know I

00:00:13.062 --> 00:00:18.144
can make more than one batch of brownies. If I only had 2/3 of a cup of sugar, I

00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:22.534
can make exactly 1 batch of brownies. But I'll have extra leftover, I'll have a

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:26.572
3rd of a cup of sugar that I can still use. If you said more than 1 batch of

00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:27.709
brownies, nice work.
