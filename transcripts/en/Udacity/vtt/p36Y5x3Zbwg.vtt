00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.990
Okay, you've got Android Studio up and
running, awesome work.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.370
Now, you're going to participate in
an important programming tradition.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.940
Making a hello world app.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.890
This is the basically the first step
towards becoming an Android developer.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.590
And at the end of the lesson, you're
going to take this hello world app and

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.690
you're going to change it
into the birthday card app.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.480
So, you might be wondering what
exactly is a hello world program.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.420
Well, typically in
programming languages,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.020
one of the easiest things you could do
is print out some words to the screen.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.980
So therefore, usually the first program
that will make it in a programming

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.290
language is a program that
will do exactly that.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.250
Print some words out to the screen.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.920
It's kind of like when you're studying a
new human language, how you learn words

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.100
like thank you or please or
excuse me where's the bathroom?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.910
A sort of your first building
blocks of that language.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.500
Okay, let's build the hello world app.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.260
A quick note before we get started.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.930
This video was recorded April 6, 2015.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.500
Now, my suggestion to you is that you
don't follow along with the video.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.529
Instead, go ahead and
watch the video through once.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.770
After you're done with that,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.190
we've provided some text instructions
on the instructor notes.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.840
From time to time, Android Studio is
updated, which means that menus or

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.400
screens can look a little bit different.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.960
And while the video
might be out of date,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.520
the text instructions will be
updated a lot more regularly.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.030
Okay, so, if you've closed
Android Studio, go ahead and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.200
reopen Android Studio.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.270
You should be starting at this screen.

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:24.112
I'm going to go ahead and
click on this aptly named,

00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:26.389
start a new
Android Studio Project button.

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:28.152
All right,
that should take you to this screen,

00:01:28.152 --> 00:01:30.400
where we have a couple
of different options.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.750
The first one is the application name.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.790
This is the name that you'll see in
the app bar at the top of the app

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.490
as well as the all app
screen of the device.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.020
Preemptively, I'm going to go ahead and
they name this happy birthday.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.500
Okay, right below this
we have company domain.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.400
And if this looks similar to
a web address, you're right.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.360
Normally if you owned a web address,
you type it in here.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.220
Now, at one point in my life
I owned lylaujiwara.com.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.880
So, if I was making an app for
myself, instead of a demo app for

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.918
all of you, I will go ahead and
change this to lylafujiwara.com.

00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:07.019
Now, you might be wondering why.

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:10.901
Well, if I was planning to
distribute my app on Google Play,

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:17.060
this package name down here is something
that I need to uniquely identify my app.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.040
Meaning, that across all of the people
in the world who are making apps,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.050
this needs to be completely unique.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.030
Now, if we look a little bit
more at the structure of this,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.010
the package name is actually
the company domain reversed.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.860
So, instead of lylafujiwara.com,
we have com.lylafujiwara.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.220
Followed by the application
name with no spaces.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.540
So while there might be a couple of
different app developers that make

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.620
a happy birthday app, you're not
going to have a bunch of app developers

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.870
that all own lilafujiwara.com and
are making a birthday card app.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.010
And in the way that the Internet is
set up, if I buy lylafujiwara.com,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.120
that means I should have complete
control over what is shown there and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.620
nobody else can buy that domain name.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.570
And if I own it and it's specific to me,

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.900
then, that helps ensure that this
package name is completely unique.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.370
So, I know that you only know
about package names right now.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.180
You might not know what a package is.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.280
We'll talk about that
more a little bit later.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.520
But the thing that you just need to
keep in mind right now is that a package

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.970
name needs to be unique so
that Google Play and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.580
your phone has a unique way
to identify your application.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.760
Okay, but you're not me and
you don't own this domain.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.610
And since we're all
practicing together and

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.900
I want us all to have sort
of the same set up for

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.270
this app, I'm going to change
this to android.example.com.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.930
And you should go ahead and
use the same company domain name

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.560
because I know that some of you won't
actually own website domains yourself.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.650
Also, it will be back our code.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.660
And if you look below, you should see
that it says com.example.android.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.930
Again, that's the reverse
of Android example com.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.880
And that it says happy
birthday after it.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.190
Okay, so the next thing that you
can change is the project location.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.890
This is where all the files
that have to deal with your app

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.790
will be saved on your computer.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.280
Now, usually Android Studio
will create a folder for

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.130
your Android Studio projects.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.930
And the default is to just put
your app inside this folder.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.850
And you can see that the name actually

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.380
matches the name of the folder
that it will be in.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.720
This is a pretty good default location,
so unless you have any strong reason to

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.570
change it,
I'd go ahead to just click next.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.260
Okay, now this is a fun screen.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.750
It let's us pick what phones and

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.490
devices that we're going to
actually make our application for.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.520
Now, you're making an app for
a phone and a tablet.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.560
And you're not trying to make an app for
TV wear or glass.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.720
So, we're going to leave
these all unchecked.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.760
The drop down right here shows us the
version of the Android operating system

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.070
that our application will support.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.780
We're going to go ahead and scroll up.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.110
You can see that the first public and

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.840
widely used release of
Android was called cupcake.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.650
With this release,

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.030
Google started a convention where they
would continue to go alphabetically.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.990
But name each operating system
off of desserts or sugary treats.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.880
Cupcake was followed by donut and
eclair.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.430
And this is why you'll see words like
ice cream sandwich, honeycomb, and

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.670
KitKat in the dropdown menu.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.060
Now below this dropdown, you'll see
this handy help me choose link.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.620
This graph shows some helpful
percentages of how many people who have

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.350
Android phones use the different
operating system versions.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.550
Looking at it,
we can see that most users,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.355
at least of the time of this recording,
are using the deliciously named KitKat.

00:05:17.355 --> 00:05:18.387
The percentages,

00:05:18.387 --> 00:05:22.255
show the percentages of people in
the world using Google Play who will be

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:26.327
able to use our app if we pick one of
these as our minimum supported version.

00:05:26.327 --> 00:05:28.986
So if you pick the newest
version of the operating system,

00:05:28.986 --> 00:05:31.699
which is Lollipop,
at least at the time of this recording,

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.045
only users with new phones would
be able to download your app.

00:05:35.045 --> 00:05:39.715
And that would mean you'd only have
about 0.1% of all of the phone users

00:05:39.715 --> 00:05:42.105
actually able to download your app.

00:05:42.105 --> 00:05:44.330
So you might be asking,
why not make an app for

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.545
all phones by picking the oldest
version of the operating system?

00:05:47.545 --> 00:05:50.530
Here's a picture of the first
commercially available Android phone.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.280
The T-mobile G1,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.180
which is also known outside
the United States as the HTC Dream.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.270
It was released in 2008 and
ran Android 1.0.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.890
Obviously a lot has changed since then.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.440
For example, apps like Google Wallet,
which let you pay for groceries with

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.480
the wave of your smartphone,
require a Near Field Communication.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.480
A Near Field Communication or NFC, was
actually a type of hardware that didn't

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.220
make it into Android phones until 2010.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.780
So if you're making
an app that requires NFC,

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.020
there's no reason to even try
supporting older phones like this

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.200
that are running older versions
of the Android operating system.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.120
Anyway, for the purposes of your app,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.100
I want you to use API 15
which is ice cream sandwich.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.450
This should work for
about 90% of the phone users out there.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.520
All right, go ahead and click next.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.020
I want to interrupt here for
an important update.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.920
Since filming the original video,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.030
the activity templates have
actually been updated and changed.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.540
So, your screens are going to look
a little bit different than what you're

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.190
seeing in the video right now.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.750
If you're using
Android Studio Version 1.4 or newer,

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.890
you're going to see
these screens instead.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.860
And instead of selecting blank activity,

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.880
what I want you to do is select
the empty activity template.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.600
This will generate the correct files
that will allow you to follow along with

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.360
the rest of the course.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.610
On this screen, you're given a bunch of
starting templates you can choose from.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.582
Depending on what you're trying to make.

00:07:08.582 --> 00:07:10.150
You're going to go ahead
choose blank activity,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.620
which is already selected,
because it's the sublist one.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.240
And I'm going to click Next.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.157
Finally, this screen gives you
the opportunities to name a couple of

00:07:18.157 --> 00:07:20.825
different files that are going to
be automatically generated for

00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:21.694
your application.

00:07:21.694 --> 00:07:26.060
As you'll soon see, an application is
composed of all the picture files,

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.440
sound files, XML files, Java files, and
more that are required to make the app.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.315
Basically, there are a lot of files that
work together to make your application.

00:07:34.315 --> 00:07:36.680
We'll talk about this all soon.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.490
For now, take a look at the layout name.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.070
You've been working on XML layout files.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.000
So this is the name of the file we'll
be editing in just a little bit.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.620
I'm actually not going to
change any of these defaults.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.840
So you can go ahead and click finish.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.460
Now, depending on your computer speed,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.950
it might take a moment
to set everything up.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.380
If you look down here,

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.470
you'll actually see a little loading
circle as well as a loading bar.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.340
And we can see a loading
circle down here as well,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.100
meaning that it's continuing
to think about things.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.050
So, take a break.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.200
Go ahead, stretch.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.500
And get some tea.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.550
I mean coffee.
