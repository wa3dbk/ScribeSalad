00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.980
Now, we kind of cheated here. Because I told you there's just

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.720
these, those two strategies. But there's actually a bunch of other strategies

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.550
you can play against tit for tat. And it's worth thinking through,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.830
how do you compute a best response to some finite-state strategy? So

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.000
tit for tat is a finite-state strategy in that it has these

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.630
two [LAUGH], these two states. And the strategies expressed in terms of

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.650
transitions between those two states. But in general, if we have some

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.640
kind of finite-state strategy, like tit for tat, how do we figure

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.320
out how to maximize our own reward in the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.410
face of playing against that strategy? So in this

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.810
picture here that I drew, the states are labeled

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.874
with the opponent's choice, the finite state strategies choice, okay?

00:00:37.874 --> 00:00:38.792
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:42.100
&gt;&gt; The edges, that's in black, the edges and

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.270
labeled in green here, are labeled with our choice.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.100
So, for example, if we're in this state of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.160
the, sorry, if our opponent is in this state.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.001
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.140
&gt;&gt; We have a choice. We can either

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.130
cooperate or defect. On this round.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.950
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.310
&gt;&gt; So, the green arrows tell us how that will impact the state of the

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.060
opponent. And then these red numbers, I

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.560
just added the information about well I know

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.540
that if the opponant is about to cooperate and I choose to cooperate. I can

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.040
just look up in the pay off matrix that that's a -1 for me. Right? Agreed?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.430
&gt;&gt; Agreed.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.920
&gt;&gt; So I just annotated all these edges, all these choices with these

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.510
extra numbers. So, one of the things that's cool about this is unlike

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.890
just the payoff matrix representation that we had before, our

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.490
choice, it impacts the payoff, which is the same as

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.540
that, but it also impacts the future decisions of the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.050
opponent. And that gives us this structure here and also

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.620
says that maybe this is a slightly harder thing to

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.720
figure out because of the fact that we can't just

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.400
maximize our, the number. We actually have to think about

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.520
where that's going to lead us in the future as well.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520
&gt;&gt; So two things then. One,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.040
I was always fond of saying that the matrix was all that you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.900
needed. But that really only made sense when you were just playing once.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.050
&gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.100
&gt;&gt; Right? And, two, I look at this and it's a finite state machine

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.990
but you know what else it looks like to me? It looks like an MDP.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.930
&gt;&gt; Excellent. It is indeed an MDP. Now,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.320
it's a, in this case, my opponent's finite

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.740
state strategy is deterministic, so it's a deterministic

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.350
MDP, but it is. It's a discounted MDP.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.590
Gamma's playing the role of the discount factor.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.960
The entries from the payoff matrix are playing

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.330
the roles of rewards Our action is playing

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.460
the choice of our action, and the opponent's

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.530
internal state structure is playing the role our

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.620
states. So it is, it's an MDP, and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.010
so how do we figure out what an

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.780
optimal strategy is against a finite state strategy?

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.560
&gt;&gt; We solve the MDP.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. So any, any method for solving an MDP can then be used

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.680
to actually compute the strategy, so what is the strategy going to look like? It

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.468
is going to be a mapping from states of the opponent to action choices for us.

00:02:40.468 --> 00:02:43.300
&gt;&gt; Right, but that's fine because a state

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.020
does not have to be your state, it's

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.200
just what matters. What matters in this case

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.900
is what they opponent is going to do.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.030
&gt;&gt; Right. So now what are the strategies

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.382
that can be meaningful against tit for tat?

00:02:56.382 --> 00:02:56.780
&gt;&gt; So

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.790
if we cooperate then we're going to stay in

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.140
this state and it's always going to be the

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.170
right thing to do to cooperate. So always

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.060
cooperate is one. If we always, if we defect,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.910
now we have a choice again so we

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.760
could defect from this state which would cause us

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.610
to defect forever, so always defect is another

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.360
one. But what's the other thing that could happen?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.450
&gt;&gt; Well, we could tit for tat ourselves.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.929
&gt;&gt; Well, sort of. I mean, so, we could defect, so we could

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:26.190
defect against cooperate, but cooperate against defect. Which

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.954
would actually cause us to do D-C, D-C,

00:03:29.954 --> 00:03:36.220
D-C. So those are the only, oh I see. No, you're right. I'm not sure how to

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.580
say it. But the policy is, defect when

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.440
you're in this state, and cooperate when you're in

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.130
this state. But the effect of that is to go back and forth against tit for tat.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.530
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.700
&gt;&gt; Basically, take this loop here.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.860
And those are the only policies that matter. And in this case, we

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.060
worked out that. Always cooperate is good against tit for tat if it has

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.070
a high discount factor and always defect is better if you have a

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.542
low discount factor. But, we can get that for real by solving the MDP.

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:03.570
&gt;&gt; Right and that makes sense and the reason that those are only

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.520
3, let me see if I get this right, the reason those are the

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.690
only 3 that makes sense because if you think of this as an MDP

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.870
then it has no history, so when you are in C there are only

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.210
2 choices and when you are in D there are

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.197
really only two choices so if you look at the way

00:04:16.197 --> 00:04:18.510
you've drawn it. You either stay were you are in

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.459
c or d, or you take the loop. And those are

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.650
really the only three options because the rest of them

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.250
would require you remember what you did, you know, a time

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.110
step or two ago, and there's no way to do

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.990
that in an MDP, at least not as you've written it.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.490
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a way to do it, it just would never be better

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.974
than doing it this way. So an MDP always has a mark off deterministic

00:04:37.974 --> 00:04:39.550
optimal policy.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.010
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.240
&gt;&gt; So we only need to consider those.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.140
&gt;&gt; I think that was the same thing that

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.000
I was trying to say, but with different words.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.510
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ok.
