00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.349
We know the b represents the y-intercept. We can see the y-intercept was 3 or

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:08.924
positive 3 and here the y-intercept was negative 1 just like in our equation. So

00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:13.548
the only thing that changed between these two equations was the y-intercepts and

00:00:13.548 --> 00:00:15.462
we can also see that on the graph.
