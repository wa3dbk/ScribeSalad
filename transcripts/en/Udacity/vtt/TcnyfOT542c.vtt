00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.314
So for the next part of the course, we're
going to talk about one of the ways that

00:00:03.314 --> 00:00:09.466
most people use math really frequently,
and that is with money. Now even though

00:00:09.478 --> 00:00:13.057
these dollar bills came out of my pocket,
we're not going to talk about my personal

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:17.708
financial situation. Instead, we're going
to talk about the financial situation of a

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:22.466
pretend startup called Gleaming Glasses.
Now this story may not be entirely fact

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:26.597
based, but the same principles and the
same math, that we'll talk about in

00:00:26.597 --> 00:00:30.639
regards to Gleaming Glasses, apply to
businesses in the real world too. My

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:34.296
friend Grant kept getting tired of having
to clean his glasses. It was really

00:00:34.308 --> 00:00:39.013
tedious and frustrating. He'd have to take
his glasses off of his face to clean them,

00:00:39.107 --> 00:00:42.526
which means that he could never really see
how clean he was getting them in the first

00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:47.467
place. One day while in the car, Grant had
an epiphany. If windshield wipers could

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:52.112
clean his windshield so well, why not just
make windshield wipers for glasses? But

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:56.602
Grant had a problem, he didn't have very
much money. So Grant decided that he would

00:00:56.614 --> 00:01:01.030
pitch his idea to a venture capital firm.
Basically, a venture capitalist is a

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:05.340
person who invests money in brand new
companies that don't have enough money on

00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:09.665
their own to do what they want to do.
Grant's glasses wipers idea was so awesome

00:01:09.677 --> 00:01:14.625
that he received $3,000,000 from a venture
capital firm. Now, what matters isn't just

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:18.975
how much money Grant got initially from
his funders though. What he really cares

00:01:18.987 --> 00:01:22.076
about at any given time is how much money
he has left over.
