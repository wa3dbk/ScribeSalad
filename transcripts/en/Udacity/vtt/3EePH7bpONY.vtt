So, now that we've come to a close in this first lesson, we hope you can see

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.910
that psychology answers all of these questions and more. How deep, rich, and

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.100
broad psychology is as a discipline. In fact, it's as much about lab coats and

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.590
children, courtrooms, learning and memory. Our personalities and how other

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.790
people influences as much as it is about cultures and therapists. So, in the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.610
coming lessons, we're going to focus in more detail on some of the kinds of

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.140
questions that psychologists ask and then attempt to answer. And, in doing so,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.180
we hope to stimulate you to ask your own questions about human nature. Who

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.574
knows? Maybe one day you'll be providing us with answers as a psychologist.
