00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.944
Take a look and examine the legs of the model. I expect you'll see some odd

00:00:02.944 --> 00:00:05.878
shading on them. If you make the headlight brighter, the effect will become

00:00:05.878 --> 00:00:08.811
more obvious. Moving the spot like this is likely to shift these patterns

00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:12.182
around. The shadow mapping algorithm works by seeing the world from the lights

00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:16.010
point of view. The depth image form is then checked during normal rendering.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.971
The depth of the surface visible at a point is compared with the transformed

00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:23.140
depth of the shadow map buffer holds. And that's where all the trouble begins.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.870
The pixels in the Light's image of the world don't exactly match-up with those

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.924
in the Camera's view. These cause some form of what's called Surface Acne,

00:00:29.924 --> 00:00:33.820
where little dark dots or patches appear in areas that should be fully lit.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.194
Take this example. The Light's view of the surface says that it's 3.80 meters

00:00:37.194 --> 00:00:41.500
away from the light. The Camera's view of the surface says that the location is

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.382
3.81 meters away from the light. Since this value is slightly higher than the

00:00:45.382 --> 00:00:49.233
Light's view. The surface is considered in shadow. The surface is something

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:52.692
that should be impossible. It shadows itself, as the depths don't compare as

00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:56.605
well as we would like. Here's a demo showing the problem, as well as a partial

00:00:56.605 --> 00:01:00.056
solution. On these surfaces, you can see patterns of acne, where the geometry

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:03.530
is shadowing itself. One obvious solution is to add some tolerance value,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.578
called the shadow bias. If the cameras computed distance along the lights view

00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:11.710
plus this bias is less than the lights depth, then consider the surface lit.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.270
Unfortunately, a simple bias leads to another problem called Peter Panning.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.090
Just like Peter Pan the object starts to look as if it's detached from its

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.361
shadow and sometimes as if it's hovering above its true location. In the 35 or

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:25.369
so years this algorithm has been around, many different solutions have been

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.058
proposed to this problem. There are other problems with shadow mappings. Such

00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:32.598
as the edges of the shadows looking pixelated. And solutions such as percentage

00:01:32.598 --> 00:01:36.288
cluster filtering and cascaded shadow maps. I won't explain these here except

00:01:36.288 --> 00:01:39.330
to say that 3JS has both of these solutions built in.
