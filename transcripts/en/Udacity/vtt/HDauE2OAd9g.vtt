00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.830
Inbound marketing refers to the
activities that you do and the content

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.270
that you create that drives people to
come to you and engage with your site,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.680
your product, or your social channels
rather than having to go out and

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.379
get people's attention by ads or
other outbound marketing activities.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.880
You're earning the attention
of your customers and

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.200
drawing them in by producing
interesting content.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.600
Then you want to personalize your
content to the needs and wants of your

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.620
target audience, and your going to
want to have multi-channel mindset here.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.780
With inbound marketing you're going to
need to connect with your users,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.180
where they are, and where they want
you to connect with them whether

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.090
that be by using your blog,
publishing things on social media,

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.340
your SEO search results, or
even emails you send out.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.380
Now one thing that's really important
with inbound marketing, and

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.130
frankly with all of your marketing
efforts is making sure you're publishing

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.090
the right content to the right people
in the right place at the right time.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.720
This intersection will allow your
marketing efforts to be helpful and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.540
relevant rather than annoying and
repetitive.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.069
Let's go to Greg to talk about his
thoughts on inbound marketing.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.850
&gt;&gt; My name's Greg Brauner.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.140
I'm Head of Marketing, at Udacity.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.250
I've been in marketing for
about 15 years.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.810
Inbound marketing is a set
of activities that you take

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.910
to engage with your audience to get
them to come to your site directly.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.780
These are things like blog posts, social
posts, things on Facebook, LinkedIn, and

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.010
Twitter that you engage
direct with your audience and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.420
get them to come to your site.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.985
So the content attracting
the user to the site is going

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:26.835
to have to be relevant.

00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:30.405
So for example in Udacity's case we
provide an education platform and

00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:32.745
an education service for
you to come and learn from us.

00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:35.243
If we were to post things relating to
education that show us thought leaders

00:01:35.243 --> 00:01:37.732
or knowing exactly what we're talking
about in the education space, or

00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:39.995
relevant to topics that
they're interested in they're

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:41.135
more likely to come to us.

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:44.140
So being an educational platform when
we send out things that are related to

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.640
the continuing education for

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.120
them, things that we're
launching that are new,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.495
things that are really relevant to why
they came to use in the first place.

00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:52.630
If we start out saying things about cats
and muscle cars it's really not what

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.510
they want to hear from us and
they'll ignore us pretty quickly or

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.070
wonder what the heck
we're doing over here.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.320
So when you look at creating different
types of content what you really want to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.030
understand is what type of content your
audience really wants to engage with.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.130
There is everything from webcasts
to info-graphics to memes,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.930
but you have to pick the right one for
you and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.850
your audience because they're going
come want to consume in a certain way.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.770
The best way to do that is back
to AB testing is to go ahead and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.730
send out two different messages.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.220
Send out an info-graphic one month and
a meme the next month and

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.420
a vine the third month.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.850
See what gets the highest engagement,
and

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.480
then from there you can refine
your marketing plan and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.540
determine out what kind of inbound
content you want to spend time on.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.010
So when you look at creating content
you want to make sure you're hitting

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.880
the right people with the right content
at the right place at the right time.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.010
Look at Facebook versus Twitter to
get an example of how you engage your

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.140
audience differently.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.930
On Facebook you can post
long form content and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.010
engage in a very deep
discussion with your customers.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.060
On Twitter it's a shorter medium right?

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.350
So you only have a 140 characters so

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.700
you have to really be thoughtful
about what you post, and try and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.510
get them back to your site and
engage with you there.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.920
So when you look at good
quality content and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.960
creating quality content you want
to do it yourself if you can.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.750
You can control the message,
the theme, the colors, the images, and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.940
it's something that really
ties to you and your company.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.780
If you buy content or

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.380
syndicate someone else's content you
don't always get what you really want.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.940
I think Virgin America right now is
doing an amazing job with their content

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.100
creation and their marketing.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.600
It's unique, it's original,
it's definitely to their brand.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.960
I encourage you to check out their
billboards, and their website.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.720
They've done an amazing job
in creating a fun airline in

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.622
a space where it's really
not a lot of fun to fly.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:11.560
When you look at creating a blog and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.780
a readership there what you really
want to do is have a contact calendar.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.640
Look out a month or two months of what
you want to write, what you want to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.290
talk about, and then figure out
how to get that content created.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.410
So again we're talking
about original content.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.220
What you want to have is
someone creating it for

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.620
you in a way that tells your story.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.750
That's the best way to create any
type of sort of blog following.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.640
I would say when you look at publisher
and social you really have to pay

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.580
attention to what channels
you want to engage with and

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.130
have time to engage with.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.010
When you look at LinkedIn or
Twitter or Facebook,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.830
which are the three kind of big ones
right now they all have their different

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.420
ways people want to interact, and
they want to hear back from you as well.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.430
So example on Twitter don't just post
stuff and never go back to it again.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.330
You want to actually engage
because people will retweet you.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.110
They'll talk to you, ask you questions.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.090
Make sure if you do engage in
social you have time to nurture and

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.760
engage that community in the way
that they want to talk to you,
