00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.510
If tunnel mode is used, then the ESP
header is added after the new IP header.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.180
And a packet payload,
which now contains the entire original

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.260
packet plus the ESP trailer,
is then encrypted.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.593
Therefore, even the original IP header
data, including the original source and

00:00:17.593 --> 00:00:20.850
destination IP addresses, are encrypted.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.100
Similarly, the message
authentication code is computed

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.130
over the entire original packet
plus the ESP header and trailer.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.020
Therefore even the header
information of the original IP, for

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.050
example, the source and destination
IP addresses are authenticated.
