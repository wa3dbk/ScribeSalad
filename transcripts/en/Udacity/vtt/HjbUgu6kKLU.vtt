00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.172
Alright. So here's our cake challenge. One half of a cake was eaten. If 3 10ths

00:00:04.172 --> 00:00:08.332
of the remaining half of the cake was eaten, what fraction of the original cake

00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:12.680
is left? You're going to need to combine what you've learned so far. Think about

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.908
if you need to add, subtract, multiply or divide. Also think about how much cake

00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:21.096
you have to start. This is a tough problem. So, take your time and work slowly.

00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:25.076
Patient problem solving can often pay off in the end. Make sure your reasoning

00:00:25.076 --> 00:00:29.074
through each step, and use diagrams to support your reasoning. You can put your

00:00:29.074 --> 00:00:30.850
answer in this box here. Good luck.
