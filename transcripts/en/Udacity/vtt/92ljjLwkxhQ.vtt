You know that merging and branching both have to do with commits, but

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.939
what kind of relationships does each of these ideas have with the commit.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.870
Branches are really just labels that refer to commits, so

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.790
we have this new kind of relationship, through first year relationship.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.010
So this has to be branch.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.890
Let's make sure this really makes sense.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.560
Does diff really have an operates on relationship with branch?

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.700
Well, yes.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.210
You can diff two commits or

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.430
you can diff two branches, which is basically just diff into two commits.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.360
But they're sort of different ideas,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.640
similarly you can run log on a branch or on a commit.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.760
So this must mean that merge goes here.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.440
So let's check this one, does merge operate on commits?

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.900
Well, yeah, merge takes two commits and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.470
sort of smushes them together into a new commit.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.700
So I think operates on is a pretty good description there.
