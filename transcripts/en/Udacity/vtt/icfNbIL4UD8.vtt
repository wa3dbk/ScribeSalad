Alright, so for the first one, 4 to the negative 1. I know right above it I have

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:09.057
4 to the 0 or I have 1. To lose a power or to drop down I need to divide by 4. 1

00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:13.580
divided by 4 is 1 4th. For the second one, 4 to the negative 2, I just take 1

00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:17.899
4th and divide it by 4. Remember dividing by a number is the same thing as

00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:22.812
multiplying by the reciprocal. 1 4th times 1 4th. Or 1 16th, and finally 4 to

00:00:22.824 --> 00:00:27.961
the negative 3. So I need to take 1 16th and divide it by 4. And remember,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.659
dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. So I have 1

00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:37.478
16th times 1 4th, or 1 over 64. Nice work on that quiz.
