00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.908
So, we saw that six frames per second was usable, but not very fast. In fact for

00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:08.876
video games, the minimum rate is often, 30 frames per second or even 60 frames

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:12.885
per second. These numbers are not arbitrary, but are tied to the hardware

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:17.458
itself. Most monitors these days, at least in America, refresh at 60 Hertz,

00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:21.630
which means display the image 60 times a second. This is called the refresh

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.716
rate. This value is part of the monitor itself, not something that varies. This

00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:29.556
value of 60 Hertz gives an upper limit on the frame rate, the number of new

00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:33.490
images per second. However an application can certainly have fewer frames per

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.292
second. So, for example, say it takes us a tenth of a second to compute and

00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:41.510
display each new image. This would mean our frame rate is 10 frames per second.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.196
The display itself may refresh, that is, send it's stored image to the screen 60

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:49.755
times a second. But most of those images will be the same. In fact, each

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:54.373
computed image will be refreshed 6 times on the screen. In the film industry,

00:00:54.373 --> 00:00:58.716
the frame rate is 24 frames per second. However, the refresh rate can be 48 or

00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:03.672
72 hertz with each frame, repeatedly projected two or three times. It surprises

00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:07.516
people that the frame rate of film is so low compared to computer games with

00:01:07.516 --> 00:01:11.748
rates like 60 frames per second. I won't go into the details in this course, but

00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:15.276
the key reason that film can have such a comparatively low rate, is that film

00:01:15.276 --> 00:01:18.876
captures what is called motion blur. When a frame is captured by the camera,

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:22.890
objects moving will be slightly blurred. This gives a smoother experience and so

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.394
a lower frame rate is possible. A fair bit of research has been done in the

00:01:26.394 --> 00:01:30.202
field of computer graphics to rapidly create frames with motion blur, since they

00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:34.535
look more realistic. See the additional course materials for more on this topic.

00:01:34.535 --> 00:01:38.692
However, a film is not interactive. A faster frame rate in an application also

00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:42.039
allows a faster reaction time, giving a more immersive feel.
