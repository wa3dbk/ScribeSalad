00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.340
Before we move into writing the code for
pitch perfect, I want to cover a softer

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.340
pattern that'll be really useful
in your time as an iOS developer.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.920
Let me introduce the MVC pattern to you.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.420
We're going to build the pitch perfect
up using this pattern, so knowing it

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.930
will be really handy to figure out
where we are, and where we need to be.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.790
The model view controller pattern
hails back from the Mac development

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.200
days of the 80s.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.020
And it's still as useful
today as it was then.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.420
You'll see it called model view
controller or MVC for short.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.280
We can think of our pitch perfect
cap as having three parts.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.880
The view, which the user sees
with the buttons, the model,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.360
which is what was stored to recorded
audio file, and the controller,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.320
which we used to store and retrieve data
from the model and show it in the view.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.290
Think of the data your app contains.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.220
For pitch perfect this
is just an audio file.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.730
But as you progress as an IOS developer,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.040
you will build ever
more complicated apps.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.570
Which you need to store a lot more data.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.690
All of the costs involved
with storing and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.630
maintaining this data can be
referred to as the model.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.560
On the other side of
the diagram we have the view.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.720
The view is what the user sees on screen
and how they interact with the app.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.600
The view does not know anything
about the data itself or

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.080
the model as we call it here.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.090
It only knows how to display
the subset of data that it's given.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.590
It is just your user interface.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.980
In between them, and in charge of
providing the view with data and

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.810
the model with any
actions from the view.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.260
Is the Controller.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.660
When the user action happens on
the view, the Controller is notified.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.250
If needed, it updates the Model.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.360
When the Model is changed
by some external event,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.150
it notifies the Controller,
which can update the View if needed.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.390
Maybe you're thinking.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.650
Why not just embed all
of the model data code.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.600
Inside the view.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.780
What's often the case that you need
to have multiple different views.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.500
To show some parts of the same data.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.940
What would you do then?

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.850
Copy and pasting the code would
quickly turn this project

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.350
into what one of my colleagues
refers to as copy pasta.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.680
Great to eat but
horrible to have in your code.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.230
Having a division in
responsibility between the model.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.720
The view and the controller in between
makes your code easy to maintain,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.930
easy to understand, and reusable.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.910
As we start building pitch perfect
together, you're going to see the model,

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.060
the view, and the controller parts,
and how they communicate.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.880
Students have found it really
handy to have this pattern and

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.180
thought in the back of their minds.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.540
As they are developing for iOS.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.298
It helps to keep your app structured and
easier to develop.
