00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.005
So the ideal number of keys per bucket is simply n over b.

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:11.119
If every bucket has n over b items, then the items are all evenly spread between buckets.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:13.482
So this is largely a function of this hash function.

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:18.860
Did we do a good job choosing a hash function that will evenly distribute all the keys among the buckets?

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.992
If we pick a bad hash function, maybe we end up with all the items in 1 bucket,

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:27.606
and this is bad because any lookups into that bucket might have to look at all n items,

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:31.290
or we could end up with no items in a bucket, and that's a waste of a bucket.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.605
Ideally, a hash function distributes all input keys evenly across buckets,

00:00:35.605 --> 00:00:38.680
so every bucket ends up with roughly the same number of items.
