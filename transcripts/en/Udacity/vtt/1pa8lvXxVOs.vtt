00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.980
But what about policies in
commercial environments?

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.250
First of all, when you go work for
a company, they might do a background

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.030
check on you, but they don't clear
you at secret or top-secret levels.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.330
So clearance is really not common when
it comes to these types of environments.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.060
However, there are other requirements
that may arise in these kind of places.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.250
If we talked about,
we go back to our payroll.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.050
If you are a payroll
department employee,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.290
then you can access applications
that have to do with payroll.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.338
But others should not
be able to do that.

00:00:36.338 --> 00:00:41.320
So one requirement could be that data
is accessed by certain applications and

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.800
only certain users be able to gain
access to certain kind of applications.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.270
Requirement may be that non-payroll
department people don't have

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.610
access to the payroll application.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.720
Other requirements that
arise in these commercial

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.680
environments is conflict of interest,
is pretty common.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.910
So if you're a law firm,
have two customers, and

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.570
there's some competitive
relations in between those, and

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.490
a lawyer working on one case
should not have access to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.235
data that belongs to the other company,
when those two companies compete.

00:01:14.235 --> 00:01:19.280
Separation-of-duty typically is good for
reducing the likelihood of fraud.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.350
So if one person can do multiple things,
it's easier for them to commit fraud.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.280
In commercial environments, clearance
is not there, BLP's not very useful,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.820
but perhaps, the need for
mandatory access control is there.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.790
So we want to look at some models
that may make sense in this setting.
