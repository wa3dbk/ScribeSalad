00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.170
When we visualize data, it's usually a lot

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.550
easier to draw conclusions. And we can see a

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.260
clear upward trend in the relationship between hours slept

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.740
and temporal memory. Based on this data, we can

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.040
say that in general, the more you sleep

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.450
the better your temporal memory score. This isn't to

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.100
say though that sleep causes a higher temporal memory

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.540
score. This is just the trend that we can

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.320
see from this data. We don't really

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.310
know if a higher temporal memory score translates

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.880
to a better test result. So we can't

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.560
say this second option. This third option is

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.850
the opposite of the relationship we see here.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.120
And we definitely do see an upward trend

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.540
in this relationship. We'll get more into visualizing

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.440
data later. But for now, the point is,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.274
data comes in all forms. As raw data, or visualized,

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:03.570
or in certain numbers that summarize the data. We should make good

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.900
decisions on what methods we should use to draw sound conclusions from our data.
