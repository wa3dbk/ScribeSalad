00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.280
Let's look at the solution to
our prefetch instructions quiz.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.330
Let's look first at this interloop and

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.910
the prefetch distance for
fetching elements of the b array.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.800
We were told that each iteration takes
ten cycles if there are no misses.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.620
And we want to eliminate misses.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.000
So if we do prefetching correctly, there
will be ten cycles per iteration here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.200
The miss penalty and the memory
latency are 200 cycles, which means

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.660
that we should be issuing a prefetch for
a b element, and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.500
200 cycles before we reach it,
corresponds to 20 iterations.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.880
So we will prefetch twenty
iterations ahead of time, and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.440
we will do it,
because if we do it this way,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.980
the prefetch will arrive just
in time for b to get its value.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.810
Now we need to figure out
what to prefetch here, and

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.720
whether we should be
doing the prefetching.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.760
We should not be doing the prefetching
if, by the time we reach

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.720
the axis to the element of a,
know that this should be i plus 1, or

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.640
something larger, this eliminates
that element from the cache.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.230
So the question is,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.000
how much cache stuff does each
iteration of this outer loop bring in?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.170
And the answer is, it brings 1000 eight
byte elements here, and an element of a.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.940
So if we prefetch with a distance of 1,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.740
what we get is that our prefetch
is done after 200 cycles.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.790
There are 10,000 cycles here, so

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.448
it's in time to be accessing the next
iteration of the outer loop.

00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:44.950
The question's just does this element
get kicked out before we can use it?

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.740
And the answer is no, because 8 times
this 1,000, ends up being 8,000.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.769
The cache is 16 kilobytes.

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:56.981
So basically if we prefetch
here the element of the a array

00:01:56.981 --> 00:02:01.633
that we prefetched will still be
there when we eventually get to

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:05.989
the next iteration of the outer
loop where we get to use it.

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:09.169
So, the answer is we should
prefetch with i plus 1,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.930
and we should not be selecting this.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.450
Note that we should not be
prefetching with i plus 20 here.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.520
If we do that, there are 20 loops in
between when we prefetch and when we

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.780
actually use it, and each of these loops
is bringing in 8,000 bytes worth of b.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.160
So if we prefetch that early, then
20 times 8 is larger than our cache,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.580
and the element we prefetch will
be kicked out from the cache.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.980
So that would be an example
of premature prefetching.
