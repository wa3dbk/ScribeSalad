00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.635
Now we're using the t distribution, and our sample mean falls right here in the

00:00:03.635 --> 00:00:09.702
middle. We want to find the price that corresponds to a t statistic of negative

00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:18.643
2.064 and positive 2.064. In other words, what value is 2.064 standard errors

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:26.445
above 1700? Where one standard error is s divided by root n. Try and calculate

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:29.190
the confidence interval, and this will be a good review of lesson eight as

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.303
well. And remember, 1700 should be right in the middle of these two values.
