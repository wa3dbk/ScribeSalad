When solving the equation, we want to multiply these terms, and then combine

00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:08.224
like terms on the same sides of the equation. Negative 4 times x is negative 4x,

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:12.386
and negative 4 times negative 4 is positive 16. This is one of the most common

00:00:12.398 --> 00:00:16.655
mistakes in algebra, forgetting to multiply a negative by another negative when

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:21.750
distributing. Be careful with that. Next we combine like terms, so, negative 4x

00:00:21.762 --> 00:00:26.668
positive 2x make negative 2x. Here I'm going to try and keep my variable

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.969
positive. I'm going to add 6x to both sides. Adding 6x to both sides leaves me

00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:37.143
with 8 equals 4x plus 16. Subtracting 16 from both sides gives me negative 8

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:42.135
equals 4x. And then my last step is just to divide by the coefficient, or the

00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:46.572
number in front of the variable, which is 4. This leaves me with x equals

00:00:46.584 --> 00:00:49.270
negative 2. Great work if you got negative 2.
