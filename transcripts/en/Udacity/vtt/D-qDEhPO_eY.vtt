00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
For this quiz, I just want to make sure that you understand

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the definition of the clustering coefficient.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So I'd like you to compute the clustering coefficient for a node in this graph.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, this graph is inspired by the flight graph for a major imaginary airline in the United States.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And it has flights that go between Seattle, Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Atlanta,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Raleigh-Durham, Philadelphia, and Providence.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This is just kind of a random selection of big cities in the US, but with emphasis on places I've lived.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
As usual, I've drawn edges between cities. In this case, if there is a flight between them.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And what we'd like you to compute for this example

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is the clustering coefficient for Chicago with the airport code ORD.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So compute that quantity and write it in the box.
