00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.000
So let's go through some of
these Gestalt Principles.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.210
The first is the Law of Past Experience.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.230
Early apps and
mobile platforms took advantage of this

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.260
by sowing you digital versions of
things from the physical world,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.320
like notepads, stop watches,
and weekly planners.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.890
The lines on the paper of a notepad app

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.170
are sometimes referred to
as skeuomorphic details.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.800
They're ornamental decorations that
can make the UI feel a little more

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.280
comfortable and familiar to the user.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.810
As mobile devices became more and
more prevalent, it became less and

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.920
less useful to incorporate
these kinds of details.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.870
People became more and
more comfortable using apps that

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.240
didn't exactly look like their
real world counterparts.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.280
And how about the Law of Proximity?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.670
Returning to the example from our quiz,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.000
these boxes representing text are close
to these circles that are likely images.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.370
They're closeness tells us instinctively
that they must be related.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.218
The text is probably the label for
the image.

00:01:00.218 --> 00:01:03.410
Even without knowing what each
item says, we won't mistake

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.190
the relation between this and
this with something like this and this.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.820
We can also recognize that these
three items are close to each other

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.300
while the others aren't.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.530
This helps us further visually
deconstruct what's going on in

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.020
this screen.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.890
Finally, we can take this a step
further with the Law of Similarity, and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.370
recognize that each of the items in
this list must represent similar things

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.340
because they look basically the same.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.070
The cool thing is, all we did here to
set up these relationships was use

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.110
white space to our advantage.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.480
Adding more space between elements
separated them both visually and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.860
conceptually.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.120
Tightening the space between
elements help them feel more related

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.780
to one another.
