00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.480
Now the final tool I want to show you today, is going to

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.220
help you track down a lot of your compute performance problems,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.370
so this is actually the profile tabs on chrome dev tools,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.140
clicking this option will give you three options or more depending on

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.460
what chrome decides to roll out in the future. The first

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.530
one you need to take a look at is, Collect JavaScript

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.370
CPU Profile. By hitting the Start button, what actually occurs is,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.310
Chrome is recording all of the application and JavaScript code that's running

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.740
right now. Hitting Stop actually gives us this beautiful chart

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.530
that allows us to see where my JavaScript was going.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.790
Now, this is actually broken up into two areas. On

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.410
the top here, you can actually see a generalization of spike

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.680
of CPU time utilized, and on the bottom, these beautiful,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.750
beautiful colored line is actually what we call a flame

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.900
chart. Scrolling my mouse cursor actually allows me to zoom

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.220
in, and what you see is a treasure trove of information.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.700
This flamechart doesn't just show us pretty rainbow pictures

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.700
on the screen, but it actually represents a inverse call

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.190
graph whose horizontal size represents how long a function

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.540
took to execute. So for example you can see the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.940
animate function was called here, and then it called

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.680
the run function, then the draw function, then another draw,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.270
and then another draw. And eventually we keep going up

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.450
and up and up the chain. Of course, hovering over

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.830
shows you the total time that these events took.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.390
And then where, in the name, shows you who actually

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.910
called that function. Now you can see we have

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.040
pillars of function calls. Basically, that's the call graph going

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.280
through. But between them we have this really interesting

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.680
little program bar that no one seems to understand what's

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.420
going on there. What you're looking at here, is

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.840
that these tall pillars actually represent a frame of computation.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.670
So this is actually a request animation frame where the page

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.120
is updated, scripts are run, everything's drawn to your screen. And then

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.240
when it's done, it relinguishes control back over to Chrome. What

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.350
you see here in the program bar, accounts for the time that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.890
the browser takes before it comes back and gives control to

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.250
the game again. So you can see here that we're actually giving

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.120
about 12 milliseconds for Chrome to do it's job, and then once

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.850
we get back it takes about two milliseconds for up to update

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.440
the scene, do any important calculations, and move onto the next frame.
