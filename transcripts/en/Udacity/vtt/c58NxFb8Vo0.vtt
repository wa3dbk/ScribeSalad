00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's take a look together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Could we have seen 0 tokens so far?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
No, when we've seen 0 tokens the red dot has to be really far to the left.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Currently, the red dot suggests that we've already seen an E and a +.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The + alone takes up 1 token, so we can't be here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Alright, but could we have just seen 1 token?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well, since we've seen an expression and a + and the smallest expression is itself,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
1 token, we need to have seen at least 2, so we can't be here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
However, we could have seen just 2 if the input so far was INT +.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We've seen 2 tokens and one of our states would be exactly this one.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
INT reduces to, or can be rewritten from, E using one of the rules in our grammar.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The + is a terminal, so it always stays the same.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Here's where we are.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
How about 3?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Well, this is a little trickier.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In our grammar, if we had seen 3 input tokens, our red dot wouldn't be right here

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
after the +, it would be over one more.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Something a little different would happen.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's very hard to have a string in the language of this grammar,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
where after 3 tokens you've just seen a +.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But surprisingly, 4 tokens does.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Let's make a little room and take a look and see why.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
E can be rewritten by INT. E can be rewritten by INT.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This + stays the same.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So the 3 of these together, E + E are themselves--one more E.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So conceptually from the parsers point of view,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
what we've seen so far is an E and a +, assuming we've done all these rewrites

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
over here on the left, and we're looking for a little more input.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So in fact, we could have seen 4 input tokens INT + INT +

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and been in this parsing state.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This might seem a little counterintuitive but remember the glory of parsing,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
or the glory of context-free grammars, is that a very concise grammar notation

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
stands for an infinite number of strings.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Even this very simple grammar has an infinite number of strings in its language,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
so it shouldn't be surprising that longer strings than 2 can have very concise parse states.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
5 tokens isn't going to work for the same reason that 3 tokens didn't work.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The dot would have to be in another place.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
However, if we were to add a few more INTs, this trick that I've done here

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
of reducing INT goes to INT goes to INT--if I had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 tokens,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I could also be in the same state.

00:02:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So 2, 4, 6, 8--the pattern repeats.
