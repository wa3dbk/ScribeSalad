00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now I'm going to show you how these translation tables work.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm going to define a variable called "table"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that's using the string.maketrans function, which makes a translation table,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and I'm going to tranlate from the characters 'ABC' to '123.'

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I can give any number of characters here--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the characters I want to replace and the ones I want to replace them with.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I should say that this is using the string module,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so somewhere we have to say import string before we start doing any of this.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You only have to do that import once, of course.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now I'm going to define a formula f to be a simple formula A plus B equals C.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Then I'm going to call the translate method of the formula f and pass it this translation table.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That will evaluate to the string 1 plus 2 equals 3.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It has taken each of the elements in the table,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and they correspond A to 1, B to 2, C to 3,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
substituted those into f and given me back a brand new string.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now if I go ahead and evaluate f.translate of table,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
which is 1 plus 2 equals 3, then that will give me the result True,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
because 1 plus 2 is 3, and that's a legal Python expression.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now what I want you to do is to define for me the function "valid,"

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
which takes a filled-in formula like 1 plus 2 equals 3, filled-in formula f,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and returns True or False. True if the formula is, in fact, valid.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
If it represents a true equation like this.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And False if it represents an invalid equation like 1 plus 3 equals 3.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Or it should also return False if it represents a error like 1 divided by 0 equals 3.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
That wouldn't return True or False, that would signal an error,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and I want you to handle that within the code for valid.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'll give you a hint,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
which is you should consider using a try statement.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Try, do something, and then you can say "except ZeroDivisionError" something.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
What that does is it executes the main body in which you can test if evaluating

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
this expression f is true or not and return appropriately,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
but if evaluating the expression f causes a zero division error,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
then this clause will catch it, and then you can do the appropriate thing here.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
You should also think about if there's anything else that can go wrong

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
within the execution of valid.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Here's my version of the solution.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I'm defining valid, takes filled-in formula f, and it's going to return True.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The main part is if we evaluate f and if that's true, then we should return True,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
but I also had to check for the zero division error

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and even to be a little bit more sore here,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I ended up checking for arithmetic error, which is a super class of zero division error.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It covers a few additional things like overflow of really big numbers.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
You didn't have to do that. I would've been fine to just catch the zero division error.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
If there is such an error, then you should return False.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But I did one more thing here, and it looks kind of complicated.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I'm using a regular expression search, and let's look at exactly what's going on

00:04:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
in this confusing part of the clause here.
