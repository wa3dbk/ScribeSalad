00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.530
All right, I'm going to give this a shot.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.780
Let's start with number of critical resources. We've

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.930
got HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that seems

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.200
like there are three critical resources. Okay. Total

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.340
critical bytes. We've got 5 Kilobytes for HTML,

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.830
4 for CSS, and 2 for JavaScript, so

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.460
that's going to be 11 total Kilobytes. And

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.190
then minimum critical path length or round trips.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.090
Let's see, hm. Is it going to be two or three?

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.100
Can the browser download both the CSS and JavaScript in parallel?

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.250
&gt;&gt; It's two. The browser can download both files in parallel. Note that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.010
the number of critical resources and

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.220
the total number of Kilobytes has increased,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.410
but the critical pathlength stayed the same. Now as an exercisem imagine that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.970
each round trip took one full second because you're on a really slow connection.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.750
How long do you think it would take for us to render something on the screen?

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.760
&gt;&gt; 2 round trips. 1 second each. 2 seconds or so.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.992
&gt;&gt; Yep. Now, imagine you're on the latest,

00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:05.610
super fast fiber connection, with 50 millisecond round-trip time.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.190
&gt;&gt; Seriously, now you're asking what's 2 times

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.500
50 milliseconds. Yeah, it's going to be 100 milliseconds.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.010
&gt;&gt; It's a good exercise. Now you have a good approximation

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.420
for how long the page will take to render. And it

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.180
only took a minimal amount of analysis.
