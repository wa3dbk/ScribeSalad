00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.525
Now, before we get into some of the minute details of using our physics engine,

00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:08.429
let's take a minute, and go through our wish list of what we'd like our physics

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.271
engine to do for us. And why it makes our lives a lot simpler. The first thing

00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:18.044
is, that we like to be able to create physics objects for each of our game

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:22.796
entities that needs them. We'd also like to be able to update the physics

00:00:22.796 --> 00:00:26.444
engine each frame, or rather, we'd like to be able to allow the physics engine

00:00:26.444 --> 00:00:32.134
to update itself, and take care of most of the work for us. We'd also to be

00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:36.226
able to fire off collision events between different physics objects, and then

00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:41.410
respond to them arbitrarily. And finally, we'd really like to be able to pull

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.700
updated position information for each of our game physics objects, each frame.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.220
That means effectively, that we can use the physics engines calculations to

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.174
feed position information into our rendering engine for drawing next frame. So

00:00:55.174 --> 00:00:58.956
to accomplish all of this for grids, we decided to go with a physics engine

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.806
called Box2D.
