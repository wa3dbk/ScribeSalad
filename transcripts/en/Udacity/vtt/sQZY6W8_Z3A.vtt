00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So the answer is we only need about 115 guesses.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So that shouldn't take too long, as long as there's a quick way to tell if a number is prime.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And to compute that result, we computed the log of 10 to the 100.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You could do that in Python by using the math library

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and computing the log of 10 to the power of 100 where the base of the log is math.e--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that's the constant for the natural log.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That would give you a result about 230.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We'll divide that by 2 to get the expected number of guesses we need.
