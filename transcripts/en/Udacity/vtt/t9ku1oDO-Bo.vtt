00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.188
This second answer here is correct. If we know we have a point a,b on this

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:08.093
function, then the point b,a will lie on this function, we can tell that from

00:00:08.093 --> 00:00:14.990
the graph right here. We have the point 0,150 and the point 150,0. These points

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.902
just have their coordinates switched from one another. The same is true of all

00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:23.309
these other points we have graphed. If we take a point on the red line and

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:27.582
simply switch its coordinates, we end up with a point on the purple line. That

00:00:27.582 --> 00:00:31.182
is really cool. Just looking at these two equations, you might never have

00:00:31.182 --> 00:00:33.430
expected that kind of close relationship.
