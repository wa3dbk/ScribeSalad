00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.048
There were a total of ten visits. Let's count them. We removed the last

00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:07.024
element, we had to read the element for that purpose, but there was no gap to

00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:11.445
be closed up, because that was the last one. Now before we can insert it at the

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:15.563
beginning, we have to move these four elements out of the way. Each of those

00:00:15.563 --> 00:00:22.201
moves involves reading the element and writing it back to the next position.

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:27.647
That's two visits per element and there were four elements to be moved. And

00:00:27.647 --> 00:00:32.942
finally the removed element has to be written back to the location zero. That's

00:00:32.942 --> 00:00:36.714
one more visit for a total of ten visits. The point that I want to make is that

00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:41.546
insertion into an array list. Doesn't work by magic. Under the hood, the other

00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:46.524
elements do get moved out of the way. Now you've seen quite a few algorithms

00:00:46.524 --> 00:00:50.172
for arrays and array lists, and many times you can solve your problems by just

00:00:50.172 --> 00:00:55.541
using one of those existing algorithms. But there are also situations where you

00:00:55.541 --> 00:01:00.470
need to understand the algorithm so that you can adapt them to new situations.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.300
Sarah's going to give you an example where you have to do just that.
