00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.849
Here's a summary of the various three.js settings for magnification,

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:08.237
minification, and anisotropy. The minimal settings are listed first. The higher

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:11.892
quality ones, further down. Quality does cost more GPU processing time, so you

00:00:11.892 --> 00:00:16.248
have to decide what settings you can justify. The norm nowadays is to have

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:20.103
linear magnification and the best quality mipmap filtering on. I should note

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:24.594
that anisotropic sampling does not exist on older GPUs. Though it's an

00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:27.792
extension in Web GL. Each vendor has its own secret sauce as to how they

00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:31.779
implement this algorithm. So rendering quality can vary. The maximum

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.650
anisotropic sampling rate can also vary from GPU to GPU. Calling the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.884
getMaxAnisotropy function gives the maximum rate possible on the GPU running

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:45.139
the program. This is usually a power of 2 and usually no higher than 16. You

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:48.605
can set the value higher if you want. Three.js will use the highest level

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:52.508
available on the card. More samples cost more processing power so, again, you

00:00:52.508 --> 00:00:56.580
need to decide what rate is reasonable. There are yet still better sampling

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.344
methods possible, anisotropic filtering is not the ultimate answer. I went into

00:01:00.344 --> 00:01:04.936
perhaps excessive detail on this aspect of the GPU, but for a good reason. This

00:01:04.936 --> 00:01:08.219
whole process of sampling and filtering comes up again and again throughout all

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.503
of computer graphics. If you take too many samples you're wasting time and

00:01:12.503 --> 00:01:17.558
possibly causing other problems. Too few and you can get artifacts. Where the

00:01:17.558 --> 00:01:20.873
samples are taken and how the samples are combined or filtered, can also make a

00:01:20.873 --> 00:01:25.260
huge difference. Many processes can be though of in these terms. Did I

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.789
tessellate the surface enough to capture its essence? Should my computation

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.460
happen in the vertex shader or the fragment shader? Should my shadow buffer

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.450
have a higher resolution, or should I use a different algorithm? When I think

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.375
of computer graphics and rendering as a whole, I think of it primarily in terms

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:44.406
of sampling and filtering. Give the demo a try. It will show you the valid

00:01:44.406 --> 00:01:48.278
levels for your GPU. If you only see a value 1, it means your GPU does not

00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:50.814
support anisotropic filtering.
