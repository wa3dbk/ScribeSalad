00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.300
So for this quiz, the question is, given the variables

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.490
that are defined here, and you'll see the variables already defined

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.970
in the code in your web browser. Your goal is

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.890
to write Python code that prints out the distance, in meters,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.000
that light travels in one processor cycle. Do the first

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.085
variable as speed of light, and we've assigned to the variable

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.860
speed_of_light the number of meters that light travels in a

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.270
second. It might be hard to remember that. So we also

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.050
have a comment there. We haven't used comments yet but they're

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.420
a very useful thing to add to our programs. We can write

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.925
a comment by starting with a hash symbol, that's usually the

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:38.320
Shift+3 on most keyboards. Everything from the hash to the end of

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.190
the line is a comment. That means it's ignored by the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.310
Python interpreter, but it's useful for the programmer to be able to

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.990
see it. So we'll have a comment here that says that's

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.970
meters per second. We can put anything we want in our comments.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.290
They are not interpreted by the Python interpreter. But it's a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.230
good idea to have comments that are helpful for us to remember

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.880
what we did if we need to go back to the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.220
code a few months from now and understand it. It's also a

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.790
good idea if someone else is reading the code, the comments

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.478
will help them understand it. So

00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:09.678
the second variable, we'll call cycles_per_second,

00:01:09.678 --> 00:01:13.025
and we'll give that the value 2 billion 700 million. And

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:16.157
I'm going to give it a decimal point so when Python does division,

00:01:16.157 --> 00:01:18.910
we'll get exact results. And we'll also give a

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.266
comment for this one to indicate that this is the

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:27.140
2.7 Gigahertz speed that the processor in my computer

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.610
has. So now, given those two variable definitions, your goal

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.630
is to write some Python code that prints out

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.620
the distance, in meters, that light travels in one processor

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.400
cycle. And we can compute that by dividing the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.300
speed of light by the number of cycles per second.
