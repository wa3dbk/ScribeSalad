00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.320
You did your PhD here.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:02.900
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.390
I had the privilege of working with you.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.280
And, there are certain areas that
you are very passionate about in

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.730
cyber security.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.250
I remember you sent me your book,
What Google Knows About Us.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.800
Is that interest still to
occupy some of your time?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.879
&gt;&gt; So, I'm focused really
on four varying areas.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.510
Usable security,
which I think is of critical importance.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.080
Security data visualization, the idea
of being able to present information to

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.409
humans, to find insights
that machines can't.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.890
Online privacy, critically,
critically important.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.800
And, where I'm spending a lot of
time today, is cyber conflict.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.080
Typically, what we learn in the
classroom is more system-level security.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.930
An individual system protecting
an operating system,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.720
or protecting a specific device.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.735
But, we need to think bigger,
and scale up.

00:00:55.735 --> 00:00:59.380
How do you protect a city from attack.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.830
That's where we're putting
a lot of though into it now.
