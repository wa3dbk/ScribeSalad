00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.080
Welcome back.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.952
In this session we're going to take a
look at our first Ruby Data Structures.

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:10.320
These data structures will allow us to
store more complex and interesting data.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.320
Up until this point we've seen how
we can use variables to store single

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.700
pieces of data.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.680
A single number, string, or bullion.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.690
Here's a string variable.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.500
This variable stores a single adorable
puppy named Kareem Abdul Jabark.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.100
He's lonely.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.080
In this session, we'll see how we
can cure our puppy's loneliness

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.400
by storing a collection of other dogs,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.070
together in the same variable,
using what's known as an array.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.310
See?
Now he has a couple of friends.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.270
We will also see how we can
use Ruby hashes to store

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.900
more detailed information
about each dog.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.226
Dogs are more than just a name.

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:53.910
We can add in an age for each dog.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.130
Let's also give them a breed.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.240
We now have a collection of dogs,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.560
where each dog consists of
multiple pieces of information.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.740
By the end of this session we'll
be able to use Ruby arrays and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.240
hashes to store this type
of complex data in code,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.820
whether we're working with dog data or
real product data.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.340
Let's get started.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.650
Hip, hip, array.
