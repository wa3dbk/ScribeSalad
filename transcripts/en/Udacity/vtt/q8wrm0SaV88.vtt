00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.490
The third important aspect of approaches to design, is how they are validated.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.858
As I just said, typically that means some kind of review,

00:00:09.858 --> 00:00:14.600
walk through, inspection by a team.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.430
It could also be the case that the tools that you're using,

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.850
to represent the design can do some checking for you.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.300
Some issues arise with design validation.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.110
And a key one is the independence of the validators.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.920
The problem here is that if you have the design team, doing its own validation.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.500
They may be blind to particular issues.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.940
If they didn't think about them when they were doing the design,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.690
they may not think about them when they're inspecting the design.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.290
Bringing in independent val,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.690
validators can help with the effectiveness of the design review.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.090
Second issue that arises is the,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.980
dependence of the design validation on the design method.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.960
For structured design, there's a complete set of

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.520
rules associating metrics with each of the design artifacts.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.860
On the class resource page,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.310
there's some guidelines that I've written up concerning the things that you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.439
can ask about during a object oriented design review.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.150
A third key issue with validation is when do you do it?

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.110
One strategy is to do it as you go along.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.140
That is, on a daily or weekly basis, review what you have and make adjustments.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.130
An alternative is to wait until you get to ma,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.010
major milestones, have design reviews and make your changes at that point.
