00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.400
A KWIC index system accepts as input a sequence of text lines.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.530
Each line is a sequences of words and each word is a sequence of characters.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.790
You can think of the lines as containing titles, something like titles.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.670
A line may be circularly shifted by removing its first word and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.220
appending it to the end of the line.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.010
Thus, a line consisting of four words will have four circular shifts,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.700
including the original.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.340
The idea being, that we can index into the list of

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.900
lines using each of the words that comprise the line.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.370
The quick index system outputs a listing of all the circular shifts of all

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.370
the lines in alphabetical order of the key word used to shift the line.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.450
The idea is that if you want to look up any of those titles,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.380
you can use any of the words that comprise the title to find it
