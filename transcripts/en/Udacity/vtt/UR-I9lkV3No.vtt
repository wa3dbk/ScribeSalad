Okay, I want to add a new attribute to our form.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This attribute is called action, and this controls where a form submits to.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'll give you an example.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Right now we have our tag form, and it looks like this,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and it has a couple inputs in it, and we have our closing tag,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and this is basically the structure of our document right now.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm going to add a new attribute to form called action, and it looks like this:

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
action equals, and then a URL of where we want the form to submit to.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We can put any URL in here, and when we click submit on our form,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
it will send the data there.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Okay, so for your quiz, what I'd like you to do

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is add an action attribute to your form element

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
whose value is http://www.google.com/search.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I want you to type some text in the box, click submit,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and tell me what happens.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Is it nothing?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Does the URL change with what you entered?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Does your browser go to Google search results?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Does it appear as though you've written an entire search engine?
