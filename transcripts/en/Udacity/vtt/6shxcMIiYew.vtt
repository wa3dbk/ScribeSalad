00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.961
There's one x intercept whose x coordinate is negative 3, and there's one whose

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:07.580
coordinate is 5. We can see this from the equation as well based on these

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.296
factors. We know that at the x intercepts the value of this function is 0. So

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:16.175
these are the two x values that make either of these factors 0, which then

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:20.708
makes the entire expression equal to what would be on the left hand side, 0.
