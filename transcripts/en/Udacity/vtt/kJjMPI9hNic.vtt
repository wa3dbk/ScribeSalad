00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.404
We know the line should be solid, because we have a greater than or equal to

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:09.136
symbol. Another way to confirm or think about this is to try a test point on the

00:00:09.136 --> 00:00:13.717
line. If we plug in x and y, we should get a true statement. If x is 0, and if y

00:00:13.717 --> 00:00:18.623
is 3, then we can see we get 3 is greater than or equal to 3. Because we can be

00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:24.099
greater than or equal to, this is a true statement. So this point works. And any

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.504
of these points along the line will satisfy the inequality. That's why we keep

00:00:29.504 --> 00:00:30.178
it solid.
