00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.110
This is a fairly simple exercise. You're given a program

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.000
that draws two triangles to make a square. Similar to

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.320
how this was done earlier. Back-face culling has been turned

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.820
on, which has caused one triangle to disappear. Your job is

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.790
to determine the problem and fix the triangle's representations so

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.830
that both triangles appear. Here's the method you need to fix.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.320
You can ignore the material culls at the top and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.290
the mesh and screen culls at the bottom. The problem has

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.990
to do with the geometry culls here in the middle. By the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.300
way, in Three.js Back-face culling is turned in by setting the side

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.640
variable in the material. So, here in the Material Creator we set

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.669
side to Frontside, which means that only the front faces are visible.
