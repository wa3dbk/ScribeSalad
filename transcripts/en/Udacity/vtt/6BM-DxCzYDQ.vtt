00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now I want you to define the function two pair,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which takes ranks as input, and if there are two pair

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
within the ranks, then it should return

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a 2-tuple of the highest and lowest rank,

00:00:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and if there aren't 2 pairs, it should return none.
