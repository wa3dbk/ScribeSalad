00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Obviously, the data carries a lot of information.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'll now teach you how to visualize the data,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
using a simple trick called a scatter plot.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For that, I want you to take a piece of paper and a pen or a pencil

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and arrange the data in a graph where the x axis is the size, and the y axis is the price.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In a scatter plot, each data item becomes a dot.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If we graph different sizes horizontally and prices vertically,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the very first data item can be graphed as follows.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You draw a line that's vertical at size 1400.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Every house on this dotted like is of the same size--1400.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You draw a horizontal line at the price of $98,000, just below $100,000.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Where these two lines meet you have your very first data point.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This dot corresponds to the very first house in your list of data.

00:01:06.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's do the same for the second house.
