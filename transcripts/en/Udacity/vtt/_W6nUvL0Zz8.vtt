00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.890
In the last lesson, we saw the uniform kernel or the Parzen window kernel.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.140
Another kernel that is used often is called the Gaussian kernel.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.790
The Gaussian kernel can be written in this form,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.500
where uT is the transpose of the vector of values of u.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.360
D being the dimension of the space.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.640
The kernel density estimate is then given by this expression here.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.130
It is very similar to our previous expression,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.450
except now we have used the Gaussian kernel, instead of the Parzen, Render,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.050
or the Uniform kernel, to make the density estimate.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.520
Remember, the kernel density, is an estimate of the shape of the distribution,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.900
using now here, the sum of Gaussians surrounding each data point.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.990
We are now going to investigate what happens if we change this parameter h.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.020
The h in this case is called the bandwidth for the kernel density estimate.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.580
Let's now switch to the IPython notebook,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.530
to see what happens when we change the bandwidth.
