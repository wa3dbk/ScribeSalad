00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.030
After we completely factored, here's what we end up with. Looking at the

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.757
denominator, x can equal 0, 2, or 1. So I'll write those values in this box to

00:00:08.757 --> 00:00:15.832
tell us about the domain. X can equal 0, 1, or 2. Great, that takes care of

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:20.130
half the problem. Now onto the range. Let's look at our horizontal asymptote.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.080
If there is one at all. First though, I need to multiply out what's in the

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.390
denominator and the numerator. So we have a form that we can use for long

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.049
division. In the numerator I'll have x cubed minus x. And in the denominator,

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:37.485
we have 2x to the 4th minus 6 x cubed plus 4x squared. Great. Now we can

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:41.733
divide. Setting up our long division problem. I need to see how many times 2x

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:47.306
to the 4th goes into x cubed. Well, that's just 0 times. I could carry on with

00:00:47.306 --> 00:00:50.583
my long division. But I know already that we're going to have a horizontal

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:55.065
asymptote at. That y equals 0. Now the question is is this an asymptote that

00:00:55.065 --> 00:01:01.380
the function crosses or not. To find out let's plug in 0 for y in our function.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.908
I know that this equation will be satisfied if the numerator is just equal to

00:01:04.908 --> 00:01:09.693
0. As long as the denominator is not undefined. At whatever value of x we need

00:01:09.693 --> 00:01:14.235
to do this. So let's just set x times x squared minus 1 equal to 0. Two of

00:01:14.235 --> 00:01:18.972
these factors x and x minus 1. Are also in the denominator, so I'm going to

00:01:18.972 --> 00:01:23.770
cross them out. But we still one left over, x plus 1. This means that x equals

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.060
negative 1, the graph of our function crosses through the horizontal asymptote.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.964
Since the horizontal asymptote, then, is not restricting our range, the range

00:01:31.964 --> 00:01:37.010
is just all the real numbers. So we can write a none in this box. Awesome, that

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.829
was a super complicated quiz, so if you got through it, great job.
