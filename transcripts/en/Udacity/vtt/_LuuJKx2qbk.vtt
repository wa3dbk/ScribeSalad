00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.900
In the old days,
games were written to run on

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.860
one particular model of computer or
gaming hardware.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.533
These days,

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:10.401
people will play games on any device
they can cram a microcontroller into.

00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:13.891
There's still dedicated gaming hardware,
like handhelds and

00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:18.550
consoles, but there's also mobile phones
running primarily Android and iOS.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.965
There's desktop computers running Mac,
Windows, and Linux.

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:22.769
And, of course,

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.570
there's the bane of middle school
productivity browser based games.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.420
With this wealth of gaming platforms,
the issue arises that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.170
all these platforms use different
programming languages and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.840
different systems for drawing,
networking, input, and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.730
pretty much everything else,
including in what form that these

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.120
applications take when they're
actually distributed to end users.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.640
For instance,
Android apps are written in Java and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.490
get packaged into an APK archive for
a distribution.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.260
iOS apps are written in a completely
different language, in Objective-C or

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.240
more recently in Swift.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.260
iOS apps then get packaged into
an IPA file for distribution.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.000
Web apps are a really complicated and
diverse beast.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.515
But the code that actually runs
the game on the client side needs to

00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:08.285
be in JavaScript or a language
that compiles down to JavaScript.

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:11.965
Then to distribute your web app to the
servers that are going to run it there

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:15.765
are a ton of different ways to do it,
one of which is a web archive file.

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:19.615
Desktop apps can be even more diverse
and can be written in any language that

00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:22.125
runs on a desktop computer,
which is pretty much all of them.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.980
For distribution, there are a ton
of options, including EXE files for

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.620
Windows, JARs that are executable jars,
DMG disk images for

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.620
Mac or really anything else.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.786
As an indie developer, you would
like to make cross-platform games so

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:40.254
that you can distribute your awesome new
game on as many platforms as possible.

00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:44.900
But you also don't want to write your
game three or four or five times over.
