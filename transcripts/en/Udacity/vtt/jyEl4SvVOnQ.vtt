00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
As I was describing it before, for each node we do this test to find the shortest distance so far.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That's a heap operation--there's n things in the heap, so this is a logn operation.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So this altogether is going to get run once for each node--so this part of the algorithm

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
actually takes time and logn.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For each of the edges in the graph, we do this distance reduction operation,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which also is a logn time operation--so that becomes for each edge a logn or mlogn.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now, both of these have to get done so we actually add these together nlogn and mlogn,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and into the assumption that the graph is connected, this m has to be at least as big as this n--

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
because this term dominates--so that gives us a total running time of Î˜(mlogn).

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Just I'll mention as an aside, there're some very clever data structure work that's been done

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
by Fredman and Tarjan, the same Tarjan as before, that allows this actually to be decreased

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
using a very special kind of heap that allows the running time to become nlogn+m.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We need at least m just to visit all the edges. So this is a pretty remarkable result.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I've implemented this in the past. It didn't run so fast for me.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
These are asymptotic results in that the overhead in keeping this fancy heap type

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
structure updated was more than--well, I wasn't able to implement it so it was efficient enough.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But the heaps that we were talking about the overhead is pretty raw

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and we get this kind of running time, the elapse should be pretty efficient.
