00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.630
The answer is the first and the third.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.440
The first is just
the Frobenius-Hall theorem, and

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.610
in fact this condition is equivalent
to there being a perfect matching.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.760
A vertex cover of size L always exists,
just pick L.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.030
Remember that the vertex cover
is just an upper bound, so

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.940
this does not imply that
there's a perfect matching.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.409
Lastly, if there is a matching that
admits an alternating Hamiltonian cycle,

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:30.222
then there have to be half as many
matched edges as there are vertices,

00:00:30.222 --> 00:00:31.791
which is the size of L.

00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:34.194
Note that the implication
does not work the other way.

00:00:34.194 --> 00:00:37.395
There are plenty of perfect matchings
that don't admit alternating

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:38.450
Hamiltonian cycles.
