00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.930
Since our app will have notes and

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.990
notebooks, we'll probably
need those two entities.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.570
Let's start with the notebook.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.540
We will need the following attributes,
name and creation date.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.291
Name will be a string.

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:17.540
And creation date will be a date.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.620
Once Xcode turns notebook into a class,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.970
it will also turn each of these
attributes into properties.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.685
We can also configure
the attributes over here.

00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:34.375
Optional specifies if this property
must always be present or not.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.095
Should a notebook always
have a creation date?

00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:38.555
I'd say yes.

00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:43.195
Validation rules allow you to provide
Core Data with constraints for a value.

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:46.095
For example,
if you have an attribute called salary,

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:48.265
it should always be greater than 0.

00:00:48.265 --> 00:00:53.030
Therefore, you should set salary
to have a minimum value of 0.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.430
Core Data will make sure that you never
save a value that is less than 0.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.560
Now, go ahead and
create your own entity notebook.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.370
Now, let's move to the note entity.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.580
It will have the following attributes,
creation, date and text.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.570
Should a note always
have a creation date?

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.220
Yes, so we'll set it as optional.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.740
Text, should it always have a text?

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.750
Well, it might be empty.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.280
So, I'll leave it as optional.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.780
This transient checkbox,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.280
here, means that the property
will not be saved in Core Data.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.110
I wouldn't use this.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.280
So, we'll forget about it.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.330
Now, go ahead and create your own note.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.950
There's one thing missing here.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.560
One notebook will have several notes,
and a note will have only one notebook.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.510
It's important to make sure that our
data model includes this information.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.830
We'll do this in the next
video with relationships.
