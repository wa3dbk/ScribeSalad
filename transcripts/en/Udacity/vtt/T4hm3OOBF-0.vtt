00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.370
3JS tends to create what are called canonical objects. This is where you create

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.698
an object centered around the origin and then apply a series of transforms to

00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:10.970
move it into position. This is fine so far as it goes, but is sometimes awkward

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.064
when you want to perform particular kinds of modeling. For example, if I want to

00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:18.480
make a model where I want chains of cones to build a tree, I might rather say

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.950
where I want each end of the cone to be located. This sort of modelling where I

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.346
run a program to generate an object is called procedural model. I want to orient

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:29.100
the cone, given the top and bottom locations. That'll be your task. In the

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.908
cullen routine the top and bottom variables are vector three positions given the

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:36.198
ends of the cone. You'll see documentation for the other variables in the code

00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:39.490
itself. Your task is to implement the internals of this method. Actually, I

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.270
decided to simplify a major piece for you. Mainly because it has a special case

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.820
having to do with a cross product. I implemented this function myself. So your

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.120
job is to create the proper length cylinder and feed this method its axis

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.156
direction and center. When you get the answer right, you'll see this on your

00:00:53.156 --> 00:00:56.298
screen. I gave a lot of test cones here, and in fact, a few of these revealed

00:00:56.298 --> 00:00:59.610
some bugs in my own code when I was writing it. If you ever design a component

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.660
like this, they will be used by others. I highly recommend that you try to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.263
create as many different types of test cases as you can.
