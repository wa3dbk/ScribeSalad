To draw a straight line, we only need 2 points. We have point a and we have some

00:00:04.224 --> 00:00:08.349
other point, then the shortest path between them, is just a straight line. If we

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:12.428
had just 1 point on its own, we wouldn't know what direction to draw the line

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.731
in, unless we had another point that we knew we needed to aim toward. If we want

00:00:16.743 --> 00:00:20.843
to check that this actually the line that we were looking for, however, we need

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:25.750
1 more point that supposedly lies on the line, to check that this is the correct

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:30.257
line. So, we need 3 points, if we want to check our original line. So, maybe

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.650
this point right here, is the third point that I had in addition to these two.

00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:39.171
We can see if the original line I was starting to draw goes through this point

00:00:39.183 --> 00:00:43.680
as well. And voila, we have one continuous beautiful line. Let's say, for

00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:48.355
example, that I had 3 points, and I thought that they all lay on the same line,

00:00:48.457 --> 00:00:53.005
because I thought that I had done my xy table correctly. Unfortunately, when I

00:00:53.017 --> 00:00:57.380
bring my ruler into the picture, there is no way that I can get a line that I

00:00:57.392 --> 00:01:01.517
would draw along my ruler to contain all 3 of these points. So clearly, one of

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:05.412
my coordinates must be messed up. So, a lot of the time, just to be safe, it's

00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:09.460
great to have 3 points that you think satisfy your equation, just to make sure

00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:10.586
your graph is correct.
