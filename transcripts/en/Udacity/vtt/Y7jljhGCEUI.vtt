00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.531
The vertical asymptote is the line x equals 1. This is the value of x that

00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:09.422
makes the denominator of a rational function eguals 0. X can equal one for f of

00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:13.518
x equals four over x minus 1 because well, there's a vertical asymptote right

00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:18.712
there. Its all starting to make sense and come together. If I draw in the line,

00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:22.072
x equals 1, we can see that yes in fact, it does not look But the curve of the

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:27.507
rational function is going to touch this line at all. It's just going down to

00:00:27.507 --> 00:00:31.910
negative infinity here, and coming back down from positive infinity over here.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.080
Never touching this line.
