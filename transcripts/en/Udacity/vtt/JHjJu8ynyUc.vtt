00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.380
These next few videos will explain the final project. And give

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.430
you guidance before you get started working on it. Now, if you're

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.780
enrolled in the full course experience you should complete the project. And

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.720
learn how your project's going to be evaluated. If you're enrolled in

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.780
the free courseware, you can still complete the EDA project to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.530
showcase your skills. But you won't be submitting the project to Udacity.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.190
Now, you might be wondering what should go into your analysis and

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.450
how it should be formatted. We provided an example that is linked

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.310
in the instructor notes. The example is an analysis

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.000
of the diamond status set. And you should pay careful

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.340
attention to how observations and questions are interspersed through

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.170
out it. It's almost like a stream of consciousness of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.240
an analysts thoughts. And you should do the same

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.720
exact thing when conducting your own analysis. Now, if you

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.040
haven't already, go to the Instructor Notes. Download the example

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.700
and the instructions to complete your analysis and get started.
