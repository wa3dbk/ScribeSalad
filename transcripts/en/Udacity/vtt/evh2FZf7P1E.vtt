00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. Let's figure out what the answer is.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, there's a couple of things that I want to try to illustrate with this example.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
One is that up to this point, our shortest path has been the shortest number of hops,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and there's a one hop path from A to B, which also happens that it's actually fairly expensive.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Paths that have a shorter total distance like 13 that actually consist of hops, and in fact,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the shortest of all in larger lot of hops goes like this--4+3 is 7 equals 8+2 is 10+1 is 11.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, let's take a look at how we can do this systematically

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so we can actually build an algorithm that can find answers like this.
