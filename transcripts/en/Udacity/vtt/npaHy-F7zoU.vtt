00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] One useful property of XOR is that we can use it to share a secret,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and that means we can take a secret, divide it among a group of people

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
where each person in that group does not gain any information about this secret,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but by combining their shares they can determine the secret.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here's an example: Alice has some secret X, and she wants to keep a backup copy of X.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What she does is first she generates some key,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
selected randomly and uniformly from the key space.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Then, she computes S, which is K XOR'd with X,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so that means S of I is equal to KI XOR'd with XI.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Then, she gives K to Bob and S to Colleen.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This means by combining K and S, Bob and Colleen can produce the secret X.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Either one by themselves has no information.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
K just has a sequence of random bits,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and Colleen just has X XOR'd with a sequence of random bits which provides no information about X.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This works fine as long as Alice trusts Bob and Colleen not to collude

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and to give back the values of K and S when she asks for them,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but what if she's worried that they might collude?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
She decides to share the secret among more people.

00:01:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
How many key bits will Alice need to share a 100-bit long secret among 4 people?
