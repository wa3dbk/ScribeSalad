00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.825
By now, you should've gained everything
you need to know to understand the full

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:05.790
Kernighan-Lin Algorithm.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.230
Recall the setup.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.630
You're given a graph and
a partition of its vertices, v1 and v2.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.510
You'll try to improve this partition by
swapping two subsets of the elements,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.260
x1 and x2.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.950
So how do you choose x1 and x2?

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.080
Here's the KL procedure.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.270
First, compute the internal and
external costs for every vertex.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.440
Next, mark all the nodes has unvisited.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.090
Then, carry out an iterative procedure.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.510
I'll fill this condition in momentarily.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.080
Go through every pair
of unmarked vertices,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.470
and pick the one with the largest gain.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.690
Mark that pair as visited.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.820
Now go through and update all the
internal and external costs as if a and

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.720
b had been swapped.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.260
Note that you aren't
actually swapping a and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.190
b, just updating the costs
as if you had done so.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.730
Then repeat this procedure until
you visited all the vertices.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.180
At this point, the algorithm has
computed a sequence of gains.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.880
That is, this is the first
part of the algorithm, and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.130
the output of the first part
is the sequence of gains.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.390
Now, for the next part of the algorithm,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.752
let's define something
called the cumulative gain.

00:01:13.752 --> 00:01:16.825
That's Gain with a capital G.

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:22.285
A capital G Gain is the sum of all the
little gains up to a certain point, a j.

00:01:22.285 --> 00:01:23.005
Kernighan's and

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:28.277
Lin's idea was to keep all the swaps
that maximized the cumulative gain.

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:32.647
If this cumulative gain is non-zero,
then you have a candidate x1 and

00:01:32.647 --> 00:01:36.257
x2 subsets that actually
improve the partition.

00:01:36.257 --> 00:01:40.767
You can then swap these two subsets and
update the overall cost.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.647
Now for the last detail.

00:01:42.647 --> 00:01:46.347
You'll repeat the entire procedure
we've just described, parts one and

00:01:46.347 --> 00:01:49.207
part two, until there is no more gain.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.490
In other words, if this condition is
false, then the algorithm terminates.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.290
Oh, boy.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.100
That was a lot of steps, but
hopefully the general idea is clear.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.190
Now the main issue with
this algorithm is its cost.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.880
Its sequential running time is
big O of v squared times d.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.380
Where again,
d is the maximum degree of any vortex.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.620
There are actually some more complex
variations of this algorithm that can

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.910
reduce the per iteration cost
to big O of the number of edges.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.960
Anyway, for more of my notes
on analyzing the overall cost,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.470
