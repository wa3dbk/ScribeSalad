00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is over here in the middle.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's between the two old means--the mean of the prior and the mean of the measurement.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's slightly further on the measurement side,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
because the measurement was more certain as to where the vehicle is than the prior.

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The more certain we are, the more we pull the mean in the direction of the certain answer.
