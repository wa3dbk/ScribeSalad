00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.916
Declarative memory is a broad term which can include both episodic and semantic

00:00:04.916 --> 00:00:09.950
memory. An easy way to remember declarative memory, is that you declare or

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.514
communicate your memory to another. For example, in 1492 Columbus sailed the

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:19.635
ocean blue. That is a declarative tidbit that some of you may have learned in

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:25.002
school. Two other distinctions in the types of memory are explicit memory and

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:29.890
implicit memory. Some psychologists refer to declarative memory as a type of

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.642
explicit memory. Again, this is our ability to consciously recall facts and

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:40.286
events. So we would say in some cases, that semantic and episodic memories are

00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:45.204
types of explicit memory. We're able to describe and recall events and things

00:00:45.204 --> 00:00:49.935
that we've learned in the past. Now let's go take a closer look at implicit

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:50.630
memory.
