00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We also have a question on SOAP and when to use it? Why you do use it sometimes?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Just clarifying everything about it.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I thought I was clear about on this lecture but maybe I completely misspoke.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We don't use SOAP ever at Reddit or Hipmunk and--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, I'll just say some of the providers use SOAP for Hipmunk

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because we integrate with lots of lots of people.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's a nightmare. SOAP is awful. It's a Microsoft technology, so don't use it if you can avoid it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I think the question was like "Why would you use SOAP over XML or JSON?"

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I don't know. You wouldn't. Use XML or JSON. It's a lot easier.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Everybody can parse it. You don't have to do all these complicated Microsoft stuff.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Don't use SOAP.
