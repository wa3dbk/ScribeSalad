00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.040
In order to display your sent memes
evenly across the collection view,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.760
you'll want to set the size
of the custom meme cells, and

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.250
the spacing between them.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.660
To accomplish this, we use the class,
UICollectionViewFlowLayout.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.180
Here I've opened the class reference,
and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.030
you can also find a link to
it in the instructor's notes.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.412
I encourage you to take some time
to read through it carefully.

00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:24.030
The UICollectionViewFlowLayout class
has three properties it will need for

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.040
laying out our sent memes.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.890
Minimum line spacing, minimum
inter-item spacing and item size.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.990
To implement
a UICollectionViewFlowLayout, first, add

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.110
a flow layout object to your collection
view controller using this line of code.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.180
Open up the assistant editor so
that you can see the storyboard file.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.980
And then connect the flow layout outlet
to its representation and store reward.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.440
You can see here that it's
marked with a little yellow box.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.350
Next, set the spacing between items
by setting the minimum inter-item

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.790
spacing property, like this.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.310
You can see that the variable
space is being set to 3.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.610
Similarly, use the minimum line spacing
property to set the spacing between

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.160
rows.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.380
Naturally, you don't need to use 3.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.080
Use whatever spacing
you think looks best.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.860
Last but not least, set the item size.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.450
The item size is the size
of your cells and

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.230
I encourage you to set the item
size to be dependent upon

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.070
the size of the main view,
which is dependent upon screen size.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.040
That way your layout will work for
multiple screen sizes.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.060
To access the size of the main view,
you can use this, self.view.frame.size.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.234
Here I’m accessing the width property
and you can do the same for height.

00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:41.960
So let's see how our layout looks.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.240
Okay, so apart from this one image, the
layout in portrait looks pretty good.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.440
Let's see what it looks
like in landscape.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.190
In landscape you can see that we've got
a little extra space between items.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.160
And I'm going to leave it up to
you to figure out why that is and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.230
get this layout looking
the way you want it.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.470
I'll give you a hint.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.110
One solution involves accessing
the height of the main view,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.050
kind of like the way we
accessed the width here.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.919
And that ought to give you a good
start on collection view flow layouts.
