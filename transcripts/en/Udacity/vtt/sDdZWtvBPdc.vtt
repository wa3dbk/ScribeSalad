00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.632
Now that we understand what the constants in the vertex form actually stand for

00:00:04.632 --> 00:00:09.042
and what role they play in creating the graph of an equation, let's continue

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:13.592
practicing completing the square, so you can get more and more equations into

00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:17.959
vertex form and then graph them easier. So tell me where the vertex of the

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:22.656
parabola Y equals -6X squared plus 20x minus 15 is. To figure this out, please

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:27.336
use complete in a square to put this in Vertex form and then tell me the Vertex.
