00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
It's okay to use such an algorithm if the stakes are low.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.900
It's also okay if no better algorithm is available, I mean if you need to solve your problem,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.720
better have a suboptimal solution than no solution at all.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.560
Only if you don't know better, that was probably the only answer where I would argue with you

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.260
because even if you don't know better algorithm for a problem, you should ask around.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.790
So, for example, when you're working on a problem like shortest tour,

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.540
there are lots of specialized solutions, specialized algorithms, special cases,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.630
so better talk to an expert before settling for a suboptimal algorithm,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.110
but of course I realized that this quiz is a bit subjective

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.440
and you might object to some of my answers.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.090
For example, saying that the stakes are low is something that is rather dangerous

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.350
because sometimes even a small improvement can be worth a lot of money or save lives,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.800
so you have to be careful with this one, and also here if it's a high-stake problem,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.420
well, maybe it's worth putting some thought into it and designing your own better algorithm

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.280
especially if it's not one of those famous problems here,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.420
chances are that maybe nobody has looked at it closely enough.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.460
In any case, and I think you remember my point from the beginning of this unit,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.570
using a randomized algorithm without any guarantees or detour in sight is always a gamble.

00:01:08.570 --> 99:59:59.000
So you need to think about if you want to take that gamble. It might be okay, it might not be.
