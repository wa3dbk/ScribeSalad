00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.980
Let's multiply two polynomials
together with this process.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.390
Start with the coefficient here.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.580
Write the values of
the polynomials here.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.800
Multiply them together and

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.390
I'll do the interpolation,
since that computation is a bit tedious.
