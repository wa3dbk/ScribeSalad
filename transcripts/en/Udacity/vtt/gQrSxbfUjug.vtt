00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.550
After we have built our system, verification and validation

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.970
is that phase of software development that aims to

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.000
check that the software system meets its specification and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.800
fulfills its intended purpose. More precisely, we can look

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.250
at verification and validation independently. And validation is the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.100
activity that answers the question did we build the

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.420
right system. Did we build the system that the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.030
customer wants? That will make the customer happy. Whereas verification

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.730
answers a different question which is did we build the system

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.410
right. So given a description of the system that is the one

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.280
that we derived from the customer through the collection of requirements

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.130
and then design and so on, did we build a system that

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.150
actually implements the specification that we defined? And when we look

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.600
at verification there's many, many ways of doing verification and in fact

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.430
in the mini course number four we will cover verification extensively. The

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.100
only thing I want to mention here is the fact that verification

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.110
can be performed at different levels. In particular, it can be

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.810
performed at the unit level in which we test that the individual

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.520
units work as a expected. Can be performed in the integration level

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.525
in which what we test is the interaction between the different units.

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:07.630
So we want to make sure that the different modules talk

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.720
to each other in the right way. And finally, there is system

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.440
testing in which we test the system as a whole and we

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.170
want to make sure that all the system, all the different pieces

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.010
of the system work together in the right

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.160
way. And this is also the level at which

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.360
then we will apply validation and some other

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.770
testing techniques like stress testing or robustness testing and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.890
so on. And as I said I'm not going to say anything more on this topic because

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.760
we will cover verification, and validation, and testing in

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.667
particular in great details in mini course number four.
