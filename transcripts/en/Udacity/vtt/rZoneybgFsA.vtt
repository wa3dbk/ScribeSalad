00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.809
This first example is pretty much the same thing as we already saw, right?

00:00:03.809 --> 00:00:07.250
Every thread is going to be reading from s of i -1 and then writing

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.780
the result in the s of i, for it's own value of i.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.579
And there's nothing in this statement to guarantee

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.578
that all of these reads complete before any of these rights complete.

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:20.964
And since they can be one thread's s of i sub 1 is another thread's s of i,

00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:24.394
then there's absolutely the potential for a collision here.

00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:28.862
The correct way to write this, as before, would be something like this.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.630
Where we go ahead and insert a syncthreads

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.582
and a temporary variable to separate the read and the write.

00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:35.933
So what about this second example?

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.413
Here, what this if statement does is it basically insures

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:44.477
that only the odd threads are going to try to read from s of i sub 1 and write to s sub i.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:48.917
You think about this, thread 1 is going to be reading from location 0

00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:51.423
and then writing to location 1.

00:00:51.423 --> 00:00:52.820
Thread 2 does nothing.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.424
Thread 3 reads from location 2 and writes to location 3.

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:05.007
Thread 4 does nothing, thread 5 reads from location 4 and writes to location 5 and so on.

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:07.387
So in this case there are no conflicts so this code

00:01:07.387 --> 00:01:10.824
is actually correct even without any additional internal sync threads.

00:01:10.824 --> 00:01:13.524
Our final example is, again, not correct.

00:01:13.524 --> 00:01:15.560
It's similar to the first one.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.134
Every thread is going to read from locations I - 1, I, and I + 1.

00:01:20.134 --> 00:01:24.337
It's going to do a little math, and then it's going to store the result in location i.

00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:30.517
Clearly to make sure that all of these reads happen before any of these writes,

00:01:30.517 --> 00:01:32.545
we're going to need a sync threads.

00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:34.658
So to make this code correct, we'd have to do something like this.

00:01:34.658 --> 00:01:36.623
We'd have to use a temporary variable,

00:01:36.623 --> 00:01:41.798
do all of the reads, sync, do the write, sync, and then do the printf.

00:01:41.798 --> 00:01:43.994
The writes have to complete before this printf is done

00:01:43.994 --> 00:01:46.078
to make sure that the printf prints the correct value.
