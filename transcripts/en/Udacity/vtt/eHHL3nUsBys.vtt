00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.920
Now we turn to another problem
that we'll be able to tackle

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.120
with the dynamic programming paradigm,
chain matrix multiplication.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.810
&gt;&gt; We are given a sequence of
matrices of sizes m0 by m1, m1 by m2,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.120
and so forth.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.889
And we want to compute the product
A1 through An efficiently.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.660
Note how the dimensions
here are arranged so

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.750
that such a product is always defined.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.830
The number of columns in one matrix
always matches the number of

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.630
rows in the next.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.610
First, recall that the product of a m by
n matrix with an n by p matrix produces

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.050
a matrix that is m by p, and that
the cost of computing each entry is n.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.730
Each entry can be thought of as the dot
product between the corresponding row

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.350
of the first matrix, and
the corresponding column of the second.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.690
Both these vectors have n entries.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.900
In total, we have about m
times n times p additions, and

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.810
as many multiplications.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.660
Next, recall that matrix
multiplication is associative.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.350
Thus, as far as the answer goes, it
doesn't matter whether I multiply A and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.760
B first and
then multiply that product by C.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.660
Or if I multiplied B and C first and
then multiplied that product by A.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.390
The product of all these
three will be the same, but

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.810
the number of operations may not be.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.910
let's see this with an example.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.340
We will take matrices with
these dimensions here and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.340
count the number of multiplications
using both of these strategies.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.470
If we multiply A and B first, then we
spend 50 times 20 times 50 computing AB.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.718
This matrix will have 50 rows and
50 columns, so

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:48.509
its product with C will take 50 times
50 times 1, for a total of 52,500.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.930
On the other hand, if we multiply B and
C first, this costs 20 times 50 times 1.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.390
This produces a 20 by 1 matrix.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.940
And multiplying it by a costs
50 times 20 times 1, for

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.400
a total of only 2,000,
a big improvement.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.580
So it's important to be clever
about which order we choose for

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.930
multiplying these matrices.
