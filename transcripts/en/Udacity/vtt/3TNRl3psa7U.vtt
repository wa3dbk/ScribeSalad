00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.150
Welcome to the lesson one assignments. I'm Andy Brown

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.770
and I'm a Udacity course designer. I've been working with

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.740
[UNKNOWN] Isabelle to design these lessons, these end of lesson

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.255
assignments and our intention was that they be taken in

00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:17.670
order. Lesson one, assignment, lesson two, assignment. But you

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.400
don't have to do it that way. These assignments will

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.940
take a little while. For this lesson, we expect maybe

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.500
an hour and a half, if you're doing it thoroughly.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.360
And depending on why you're taking this class, you may not need to do that.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.480
If you're a designer who is just interested

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.700
in seeing what's going on in the world

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.730
of design, you probably don't need to do all of this. But if you are a

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.790
developer and you do want to increase your

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.570
design skills, the only way is through practice.
