00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The mean is obviously 25.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In fact, every element over here is 5 times as large as any element over here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, how does this affect the variance?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Well, when we compute the differences from the mean, they're going to be 5 times as large.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
When we square them, they will be 25 times as large.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
As a result, the variance is 25 times as large as over here--it's 50.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And we can quickly check this.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Obviously, there is no difference for 25 in the middle.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
20 and 25 are 5 apart--the square of this is 25.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Same for 30. 15 and 25 are 10 apart. The square is 100.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We add those up--we get 250--and now we divide by 5 to get back our 50.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The standard deviation is 7.071,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and that's exactly 5 times as large as the standard deviation over here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If this is 25 times as large as this one,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
then the square root of it will be just 5 times as large as this one.

00:00:55.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can easily verify that this is the square root of 50.
