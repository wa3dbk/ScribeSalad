00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.120
One benefit of the algorithm
we've developed is that it

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.990
is highly generalizable.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.740
It does not depend on working
only in three dimensions.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.290
In fact, just by changing the word
plane in our algorithm to the word line

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.800
we can immediately use the code to solve
systems of equations in two dimensions.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.780
On the other hand,
this algorithm will allow us to work

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.450
with higher dimensional
systems of equations too.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.020
Recall that a two dimensional
plane in 3 dimensions

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.700
is defined by a single linear
equation in 3 variables.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.510
If we move to end dimensions a similar
notion is called a hyperplane.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.580
Which is defined by a single
linear equation with n variables.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.220
The geometry of higher
dimensional objects,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.500
even though we can't visualize
them in three dimensional space,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.530
is analogous to the geometry
we've studied so far.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.600
As with lines and planes, a hyperplane
in n dimensions is an (n-1)-dimensional

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.270
object and it can be specified by
a normal vector and a base point.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.870
Also like lines and planes
the coefficients of the variables in

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.920
the equation have a normal vector for
the higher dimensional hyperplane.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.420
And we need at least n
different hyperplanes and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.060
n dimensions in order to obtain
a unique intersection point.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.480
Most importantly Gaussian elimination
works just as well on systems of

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.400
equations in more than three variables
as it does with just two and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.560
three variables.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.580
Similar to the line in
plain classes we created,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.990
let's now create a hyperplane class.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.920
To make it, I almost literally copy and
paste my code for the plain object

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.250
just replacing all instances of
the word plane with hyperplane.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.920
The only other change I need to make
is in the initializer function.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.760
Here, since the hyperplane could
live in an arbitrary dimension.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.480
I'm adding an optional parameter,
dimension, to the list of arguments.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.450
If both the dimension and the normal
vector are missing in the initializer

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.430
call, then I can't figure out which
dimension is being asked for, so

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.770
I raise an exception.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.953
Otherwise, I either set the normal
vector to be all zeros in the given

00:02:01.953 --> 00:02:02.747
dimension or

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:06.808
I set the dimension to be the dimension
of the normal vector given.

00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:08.300
And that's pretty much it.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.810
Going back to the linear system class

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.680
after importing the hyperplane class
from my hyperplane module, and

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.190
without changing any of the code
in my linear system class.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.209
I can now build a linear
system out of hyperplanes and

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.049
as long as the dimensions of each
hyperplane in a system are the same

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.571
it will work as expected.

00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:30.542
Here I have a system of lines,
here I have a system of planes, and

00:02:30.542 --> 00:02:36.110
here I have a system of four dimensional
hyperplanes in five dimensional space.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.090
And running the code I obtain
parameterizations of the solutions for

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.540
each of the systems, or I'm told that
the system doesn't have a solution.
