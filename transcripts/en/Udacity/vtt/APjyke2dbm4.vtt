00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.664
The one I think is best is option A. One thing to think about when you look at

00:00:04.664 --> 00:00:08.060
the module[UNKNOWN] things and try to decide which is best. If it's a good

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.834
module, we should be able to give it a name. It should be conceptually

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:14.988
corresponding to something we're thinking about, and if you look at the modules

00:00:14.988 --> 00:00:18.646
here, the way A is defined, all of the things in A are thing that you can do

00:00:18.646 --> 00:00:22.450
before a query comes in. These are things that you're doing based on just

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.286
building the corpus of the web. All of the things in the second module here are

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:29.798
thing that you can do only after a query comes in. And it makes a lot of sense

00:00:29.798 --> 00:00:33.744
to divide those two phases. In version B, I've grouped lookup in the first

00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:38.010
module, and lookup is used by both lucky search and ordered search. It's not

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.090
used by any of the functions that build the corpus. So it doesn't really make a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.656
lot of sense to have it here. If we have it here, the interface between these

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:49.496
two modules is going to be much more complex than it would be if we put lookup

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:53.604
in the second module. So that's why I prefer option A to either of the other

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:57.026
two. Option C doesn't really make much sense to have lookup be all its own

00:00:57.026 --> 00:01:01.250
module. There are certainly other options, and I would encourage you to discuss

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.019
them in the forum, if you have another suggestion of how to modularize this.
