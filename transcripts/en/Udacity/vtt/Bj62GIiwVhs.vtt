00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.980
Okay, now that we have seen how register renaming works, let's try it ourselves.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.010
So let's have a register renaming quiz. Okay so

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.300
we will have a RAT here that will tell us where the values for R1, R2,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.680
R3, R4, R5, and R6 are. And over here we will have a sequence of instructions as

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.790
they're fetched. And then we will need to write in what's renamed. Okay. So

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.250
here we have the initial state of the RAT which is simply R1 is mapped to P1,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.500
R2 to P2, etc. And here are our instructions. In order to help you get started,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.740
I'm going to rename the first instruction. So after renaming,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.880
it's still a multiplication. R2 and R2 are P2 and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.420
P2. R2 is where we should put our value and, remember,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.160
we need to rename it in the RAT, so it's going to be in P7.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.940
So this is what this rename instruction looks like. Read the registers.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.160
Physical registers P2 and P2, and put the result in P7. Now it's your turn.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.330
You need to both tell me what's renamed and also update the RAT accordingly.
