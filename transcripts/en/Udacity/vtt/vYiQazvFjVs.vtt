So far, we have discussed disorders that affect both thought and behavior.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.589
However, there're some disorders that actually take on bodily or physical form

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:14.414
and actually mimic diseases. This is called Somatic Symptom Disorder. Somatic

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:18.836
Symptom Disorder used to be called hypochondriasys and is occurs when a person

00:00:18.836 --> 00:00:23.459
complains of multiple physical disorders that cause distress and distruption of

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:30.334
a person's life. And persists for at least 6 months. According to the APA,

00:00:30.334 --> 00:00:34.736
there are two main criteria for diagnosis. First, one or more distressing

00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:40.410
somatic systems that disrupt daily living. And second, excessive thoughts,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.310
feelings or behaviors related to bodily symptoms. Approximately 5 to 7% of US

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.441
adults experience Somatic Symptom Disorder. A very similar disorder is known as

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:56.494
Illness Anxiety Disorder. And it also involves a preoccupation and anxiety over

00:00:56.494 --> 00:01:00.200
having illnesses. But without any of the actual symptoms.
