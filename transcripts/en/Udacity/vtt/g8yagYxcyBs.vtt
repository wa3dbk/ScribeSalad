The answer is this equation right here, which goes with this triangle, a squared

00:00:04.097 --> 00:00:07.955
plus b squared equals c squared. These other two right triangles are a special

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:11.990
kinds of right triangles and the equations right here that show the proporions

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:16.079
between their side lengths are particular to them individually and they don't

00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:20.988
apply to all right triangles. But, now we do have a super important piece of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.257
information that we can use, not just to talk about these three right triangles,

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:29.576
but also the one in Grant's situation and any other ones moving forward. This

00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:33.845
equation, a squared plus b squared equals c squared, relating the side lengths

00:00:33.857 --> 00:00:37.744
of any right triangle together is called the Pythagorean theorem. Julie

00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:42.139
mentioned this way back in the very first lesson of this course. So, no big deal

00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:45.555
if you didn't remember it or its name. We'll keep using it in the future,

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:45.969
though.
