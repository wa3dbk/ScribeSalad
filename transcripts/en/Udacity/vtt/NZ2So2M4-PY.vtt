00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.580
So I think my experience has been that

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.760
human beings are hard wired to receive things in

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.570
story form. So if you can craft a narrative

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.060
behind what you are doing, it makes it easy

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.670
to, it makes it it makes it more compelling.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.530
And you know, it doesn't have to be you

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.360
know, like a coming of age story or anything

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.560
like that. It could simply be like like there

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.980
was this problem, there exists this problem. Here's

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.540
what people previously did, here's why it's not any

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.910
good. We did this, here's what we found

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.670
and like that's the end. So there's this sort

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.420
of like there's this narrative arrow that goes

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.810
through it. and, so that's one and number 2,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.210
I guess the other tip that I would have

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.550
is think about your audience. Who is your audience?

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.280
Are your audience is your audience technically oriented, or

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.190
are they not technically oriented? Is your goal basically, is

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.490
your, are you trying, is it a bunch of

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.430
people that you're trying to recruit to come and join

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.519
you, in which case maybe you want to show

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.890
them like cool demos. Or are they you know, just

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.420
just like a, a room full of your hard-nosed science

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.090
colleagues who are just going to brutally scrutinize whatever you present

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.880
to them in which case, you may want to do something else.
