For the x intercept we let y equal zero. So I get 4x is equal to negative 12 and

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:10.505
then I divide both sides by 4 so x is negative 3. For the y intercept remember

00:00:10.505 --> 00:00:15.835
we are somewhere along this y axis so we haven't moved left and we haven't moved

00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:21.048
right. So the x cordinate must be zero. So when x is zero y is equal to four.
