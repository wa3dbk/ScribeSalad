00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:09.379
Pennies divided by 10, it's 43, because we have 435 divided by 10. That would

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:17.115
be 43.5. The 0.5 is erased. We're left with 43. Now that means we have ten

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:23.824
times 43 of 430 accounted for. And the remainder is 5. In general the remainder

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:31.242
by 10 is always the last digit of a number. That's a useful fact to remember.
