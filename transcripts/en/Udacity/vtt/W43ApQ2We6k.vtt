00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I have magically deduced that you're answer is 3--tada. All right, now I'll show you how I did it.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I will not leave you in suspense for very long.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
All right, so see if we can work out what's going on here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This region here, this county is going to have to get some color

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and it's ultimately not really going to matter which one it is.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So I'm just going to call it that. G is going to have a color that's different from H, so we'll call it that.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, we noticed that this region touches both of these two regions

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so it has to have a different color than both of them.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This region touches both green and blue but not pink, so it has to be pink.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And d touches both pink and blue, so it has to be green.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And now we got these three regions and what do we know about these three regions.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, these two can't be green and they have to be different from each other,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
so one of them is pink and one of them is blue and that means this one is going to have to be green,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but we don't know about these two.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So here's what I'm going to do, so I'm marking this sort of both pink and blue right there.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This going diagonal lines are--this one's pink, this one's blue,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and this going diagonal lines--this one's pink and this one's blue.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Regardless, it's going to turn out not to matter.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So now you don't have to assign number to green, pink and blue--0, 1 and 2,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but notice that we have G-A here and G-A, no matter what numbers you assigned,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
they're going to be the same color.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So this has value of 0. It didn't matter what color C is, C*0 is going to end being 0.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So what we're left with is D+F+H, so D+F+H and notice that each of them are different colors,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
so no matter what numbers you assigned to those three colors,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
we're going to have exactly one of each.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The colors get assigned number 0, 1 and 2, so the sum is going to have to be 3.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So that's the trick
