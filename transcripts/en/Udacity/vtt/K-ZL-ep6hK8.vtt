Cool coffee beans,
you've made your first app, but

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.620
don't take my word for it.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.580
Make sure that it runs on your phone.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.990
So now I've taken you through three
steps to show you how to take a drawing

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.420
to an app.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.950
Let's recap a little.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.010
The first step was to choose your views.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.360
A great place to start with this step
is to circle the different views.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.470
And then decide which view
tags you need to use.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.930
Katebin Kanal taught you about two
view tags, imagery and text views.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.610
And they also mentioned
a view called a button,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.760
which we'll be using in the next lesson.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.100
As you begin to feel
a little bit more ambitious,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.222
you can discover new views
in the documentation.

00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:38.880
All right once you're done choosing
your view, you move on to positioning.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.690
And the question you need to be
asking yourself at this stage is what

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.390
view group should I use.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.780
Now, view groups have a lot
of control over how and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.010
where you position your views.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.650
If the views are aligned horizontally or
vertically,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.120
you probably want to
use a linear layout.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.240
And if the views are aligned
relative to one another,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.450
then you probably want to
use a relative layout.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.220
Now once you're made this decision,
if you're using a linear layout,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.720
you're going to think about things
like orientation and layout weight.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.030
Layout weight in particular is a little
bit complicated but pretty powerful.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.210
It allows you to sort of equally
distribute your views across the screen

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.130
which is a really great feature.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.505
If you're using a relative layout,

00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:18.430
you'll will be thinking of how to
position your views relative to their

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.000
sibling views, and to their parent view.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.770
Now, this will be done using
the align parent attributes, and

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.630
attributes like to left of and
to right of.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.180
Step three is the fun step,
where you get to style your views.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.410
During this step you'll look at things
like the text, and the color, and

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.560
the font, and
decide what you want them to look like.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.920
Will the text have a background color,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.620
how will the pictures
fill up their space?

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.290
Once you know the attributes
you're going to change,

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.170
then you need to now the correct
value you're going to change them to.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.350
Finally, you'll look at the more subtle
spacing issues between elements.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.220
And you can tweak the spacing
between elements using padding and

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.390
layout margin attributes.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.890
Once you're able to master these steps,
you should be able to take any

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.700
simple drawing that you come up with,
and turn it into an Android app layout.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.340
Good work.
