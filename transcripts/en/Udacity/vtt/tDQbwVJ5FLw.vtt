Thanks Greg for the introduction. One's ability to find meaning in a stressful

00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:08.285
event or situation can be an important predictor of one's overall physiological

00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:14.530
as well as psychological health. Sometimes in life we're exposed to devastating

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.934
situations. Such as a loss of a loved one, a natural disaster, like a tornado

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:24.795
or an earthquake. Or even a life threatening or debilitating disease. How does

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:28.735
one handle that or cope? What type of attitude would you have if you found out

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:32.705
you had late stage cancer? It turns out that how we look at the situation can

00:00:32.705 --> 00:00:37.782
be important for our health. That is, if you're able to step back and look at

00:00:37.782 --> 00:00:41.076
the big picture and find meaning in the situation, you actually may have a

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:45.770
better overall health outcome than those who can't do that.
