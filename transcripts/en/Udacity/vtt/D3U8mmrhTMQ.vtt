00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's start with door 3, and here the answer is 0.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You already saw when the curtain was lifted that there is no car.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
How about door 1, and that is a really tricky question.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For reasons that I'll explain in a minute,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
it's actually 2/3 or 0.667. It's entirely non-intuitive.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Given that this is the case, what do you think is the number for door 2?

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Of course, this is 1 - 2.3, which gives me 1/3 or 0.333.
