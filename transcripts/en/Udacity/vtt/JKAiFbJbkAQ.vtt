If you're familiar with Android Studio,
I'm sure you've at least seen some doc

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.060
Gradle files lying around
in your projects, or

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.590
noticed the Gradle
logo on some toolbars.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.590
Throughout this lesson
we'll learn how Gradle and

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.990
Android Studio work together
to build and deploy your apps.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.440
We'll also talk about how Gradle makes
it easy to create variance of your apps,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.530
like debug and release builds,
and paid versus free versions.
