Welcome to Unit 1! We're really excited to have you join us in this course.

00:00:04.102 --> 00:00:07.875
I'll be teaching Unit 1, and Dave will follow with Unit 2.

00:00:07.887 --> 00:00:09.747
Now what we're going to cover today

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:13.626
is the fundamentals of the GPU programming model and how to write your first CUDA program,

00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:16.786
and in the rest of the course, we're going to build from this foundation

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:20.329
to cover the most interesting and exciting topics in all of parallel computing.

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.199
So let's get started.
