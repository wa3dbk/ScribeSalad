00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.500
Now all of these examples, we're accessing a live

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.400
site. But you can also setup Port Forwarding to

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.960
allow your mobile device to access a local server

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.690
on your development machine over USB. Let's take a look.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.750
To do this, you want to make sure you have

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.050
a server running on your local development machine. In

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.840
this case, I'm going to use Python's simple HTTP

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.740
server on Port 9999. Now to verify that it

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.310
is actually working, I'm going to access that on

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.810
the local machine and it's working fine. If I

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.650
want to now access that same page on my

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.160
mobile device, I need to set up Port Forwarding. I

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.000
can go back to the Chrome Inspect page, click on Port Forwarding and set up a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.740
port forwarding rule. In this case, port 9999 on local host or

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.080
IP address 127001. I enable Port Forwarding and click on Done.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.490
When I refresh this page, you'll see that Port Forwarding is

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.510
now running on Port 80 80, and 99 99. At this point,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.150
we're all set up. So let's try it out. I'll open a new tab, navigate

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.630
to localhost 9999 on the mobile device. And voila, the page is ready to go.
