00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
As I said earlier, one of the biggest mistakes startup make is confusing strategic alliances

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.080
and joint partnerships for what you need on day 1.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.750
In an existing market, you actually might need these guys, but in a resegment

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.710
and in certainly a new market, these are needed for early evangelist and so you need to think through.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.060
When do I need joint partnerships and when will I be hitting mainstream customers

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.480
because remember most these partnerships tend to fail.
