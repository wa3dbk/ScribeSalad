00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.590
So supposed this is
some example data and

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.040
we are going to create a bunch
of one nearest neighbor models.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.790
We first have to select, randomly, some
of our data, to go into the first bag.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.940
So I'm going to circle
some of theses points,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.900
randomly, that represent
our first model.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.640
So we randomly selected
some of these points.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.740
Now let's show what
that model looks like.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.770
So this zigzagging orange line here

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.170
represents what that one nearest
neighbor model would look like.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.030
And, yes,
to me it looks like it's overfitting.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.230
But that's just our first model.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.430
Then we draw some more data,
and we have another model.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.220
So our other model, Model 2,
is somewhat overfitting as well.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.210
Well, let's consider
now a ensemble model

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.880
where we combine
the results of these two.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.720
And at each point where we query,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.940
remember what we do is we take
the mean of the two models.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.270
So, you can see already,
as this blue curve is a bit more smooth.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.920
And the individual models,
we're beginning to get something better.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.730
But let's add some more models.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.110
So I've drawn over here a couple
more one nearest neighbor models.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.680
And you can see each one of them
individually as sort of over fit.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.050
But if we now sample at each
individual spot across here and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.340
take the average across all of them we
get something that's much more smooth.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.510
So here's what our ensemble looks like.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.680
And as you can see,
it's much more smooth.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.370
Of course, I hand drew it.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.675
So you could accuse me
of smoothing it by hand.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:34.350
[LAUGH] Anyways, the point here
is that you can build an ensemble

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.020
that is much more smooth than any of
the individual learners by themselves.
