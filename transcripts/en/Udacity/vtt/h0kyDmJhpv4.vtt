00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Congratulations. You made it to the end of the unit. What have we learned?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, first of all, some problems require search.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What I mean by search is you need to put together a sequence of steps,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
starting from a start and keep going.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You don't know how many steps it's going to take, and you're trying to optimize some factor.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
There are different kinds of search. We just scratched the surface, believe me.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's a gigantic field with all sorts of different algorithms

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and different types of applicability for these different algorithms.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
There are many complications we didn't cover, but we covered two--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the shortest_path and the least_cost search.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
These are two of the most useful.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Third, search is really subtle.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There are lots of possible problems lurking in there and many that we didn't even cover yet.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What that means is where there is subtlety, there is likely to be bugs,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and there are even some bugs where there is no subtlety.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That means we have to be careful.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We have these two tools for combating bugs.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
One is lots of tests, and the second is standardized tools.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That is, we work really hard to make a tool that we know works

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and has got all the bugs out of it, and then we reuse that tool.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Part of that reuse is generalization--

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to look at a specific problem and say,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
"Here we solved this specific problem this way," and to generalize it,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to say here's part of that that I think we're going to use over and over again.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's break that out, and now we'll have two parts to the solution.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We want to be thinking about this specific problem,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and we want to be thinking about the more general problem.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We want to be allocating our work to one or the other appropriately.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Congratulations again. You learned a lot of important concepts.

00:01:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You did a great job in writing some very complex programs.
