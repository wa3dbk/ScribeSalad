00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.050
Let's move ahead.

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.190
The next thing I want to do is supply
out NSURL session with a request.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.380
But first, there are a few important
things that I want to point out.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.740
What we've been calling requests,
the NSURL session refers to as tasks.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.650
Also, any task used by NSURL session
is a sub class of NSURL session tasks.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.720
Let's break that down.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.570
There are three main tasks that we can
work with, data task, download task, and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.730
upload task.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.970
A data task, or
an NSURLSession data task, returns

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.700
data from the network directly into
memory as one or more NS data objects.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.730
The key word for
remembering this type of task is data.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.310
Data tasks are good for
short lived requests, and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.260
we'll be using them
exclusively in this course.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.590
A download task, or
NSURL session download task,

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.540
returns data from the network
into a temporary file.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.520
Think of these tasks like downloading
a file from the Internet,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.580
when the task completes you
have a file to work with.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.780
And finally, the upload task,
or NSURL upload session task.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.100
These kinds of tasks are specialized for
uploading content.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.830
Like I said, in this course we're
just going to focus on data task.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.320
To recap,
in the code we have the image URL and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.500
we have the shared NSURL session.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.630
So, now we're ready to make our request,
or a task in this case.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.400
To create an NSURL session data task,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.870
we need to use the NSURL sessions
method called data task with URL.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.810
We'll be using the version of this
method that takes the URL and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.170
a closure called a completionHandler and
it returns a NSURLSession data task.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.400
So I'll go ahead and capture the return
value, which is the task, and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.440
then I'll specify our imageURL.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.950
And now let's talk about
the completionHandler.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.970
The completionHandler is
just like any other closure.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.790
It's named completionHandler because
it's executed after the data task

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.780
completes and we can't really
be sure when that will happen.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.150
The task might complete
in a few milliseconds, or

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.260
it might take a whole minute.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.570
But that's the real
power of this closure.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.090
It's like us saying I don't really know
when this task is going to complete, but

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.420
when it does run this block of code.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.290
Now instead of using this closure,
we could use NSURL session's family of

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.720
delegates to handle running code
after the task completes but

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.368
we won't be doing that in this course.

00:02:10.368 --> 00:02:13.320
If you're interested, I'll post links
in the instructor notes that cover

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.540
the NSURL session
delegates in more detail.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.710
Now this completion handler
takes three parameters.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.020
The types of those parameters are NS
data, NS URL response, and NS error.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.140
Now if you haven't seen those
types before, don't worry.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.100
We'll slowly introduce them.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.680
For their local parameter names I'll
call them data, response, and error.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.560
For now let's ignore all of them and

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.400
try printing task finish
when the task completes.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.940
And we'll build and run this.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.510
Hm, well,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.860
it doesn't appear to be working because
our print statement isn't showing up.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.450
Let's talk about why this is next.
