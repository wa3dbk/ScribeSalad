00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.610
Now, remember that Marla actually
receives most of her care from

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.060
specialists.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.680
Each of them is focused on the one organ
or body system they were trained in and

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.360
they care for.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.268
Remember Doctor Johnson, the
endocrinologist who cares for Marla's

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:21.640
diabetes, and Doctor Jones, the lung
specialist to whom she was referred.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.040
Each of them will probably be interested
in different data from Marla's very

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.690
large chart.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.720
This would include subjective
information Marla has provided and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.270
objective information from her
prior physical exams, lab tests, or

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.940
other studies.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.010
Each of them will
prescribe medications and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.984
other treatments that are specific to
the disease that they're managing.

00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:45.060
Current EMRs generally
don't understand this and

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.300
don't automatically
make this distinctions.
