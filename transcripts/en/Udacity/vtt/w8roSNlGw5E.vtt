The solution for x is positive three halves. Nice work if you found this

00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:08.432
answer. I really hope you've gained some steam in solving logarithmic

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:14.806
equations. We'll start by multiplying these two arguments together to get the

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:21.528
log base 6 of 2x squared, plus 7x, equals log base 6 of 15. We get this

00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:26.694
argument by multiplying x times 2x, which is 2x squared, and x by positive 7,

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:33.408
which is positive 7x. Now we can set these two arguments equal to one another.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:38.330
We'll subtract 15 from both sides, to get our quadratic set equal to zero.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.244
Factoring this quadratic, will have the two factors of 2x minus 3, and x plus

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:49.330
5. We set each factor equal to zero, and then, we solve for the values of x.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:56.102
So, x can equal three halves, or one and a half or x can equal negative 5. We

00:00:56.102 --> 00:00:59.740
want to be cautious and make sure these answers check in our original solution.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.459
Since we have log base 6 of x, we know that x equals negative 5 will not be a

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:11.246
solution. We can't take the logarithm of a negative number. This solution

00:01:11.246 --> 00:01:16.296
doesn't work, so our only answer is x equals three halves.
