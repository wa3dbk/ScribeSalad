00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.980
To see some concrete
examples of interpolation,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.380
I've put together this little app,
and it has two spinners here.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.085
The first one has a list of a bunch
of different interpolators like

00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:20.585
accelerate, decelerate, bounce,
decelerate, linear, overshoot.

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:23.655
And the second spinner
has different timings,

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:28.366
from 100 milliseconds all the way
up to 3,000 milliseconds or

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:33.512
three seconds, so that you can see
how fast or how slow things work.

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:39.826
So if we just select 3,000 milliseconds,
it's going to be really slow.

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:44.956
And just like Roman was saying in the
previous video, it's kind of gratuitous

00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:49.406
to, and it's just too much motion to
be bouncing up and down that much.

00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:53.496
So let's try, maybe a 900 milliseconds.

00:00:55.586 --> 00:00:57.906
That looks a little bit better.

00:00:57.906 --> 00:01:00.196
So let's switch to the code and
see how this works.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.540
So here's the code that makes that work.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.540
We start off with creating a new
instance of our interpolator.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.380
Because it's different based off of what
the name is, we actually use the Java

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.400
class forName to get the class and
then instantiate a new instance.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.222
But if you were using this in your
own app, you would call, say,

00:01:22.222 --> 00:01:26.010
new BounceInterpolator directly.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.790
So after we have that,
we call animate on our text view, and

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.490
set the interpolator and
the duration from our spinner, and

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.540
tell it to start in 500 milliseconds and

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.640
to move the animation from the bottom
of the screen, and then start.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.880
Check the instructor's notes for

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.180
more information about interpolators or
this sample app

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.150
that you can play around with to see
how they work a little bit better.
