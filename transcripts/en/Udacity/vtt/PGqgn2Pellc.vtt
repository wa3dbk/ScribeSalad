00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The correct answer is 6 for the following missing links:

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
this guy here gives me two values in the matrix.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This guy here another two.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And this link here is also missing. That's another two. So 6 values are missing.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's prove it to ourselves. Moving from x0 to x1 fills up this area.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
From x1 to x2, this area.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Seeing landmark L0 from x0 and x1 means we fill these guys over here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the main diagonal there.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Seeing the other landmark from x1 and x2 means we fill these guys over here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Let's count the ones that are still open, and here are the ones.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
My answer was actually wrong. It's 8.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I overlooked there is no direct link from L1 to L2 either.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
My apologies that I gave you the wrong number,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but it proves to you this is actually not an easy question. It's harder than I thought.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The reason is there is also no direct link that constrains L1 and L2 directly.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Landmarks can't see, so they can't put a direct link between any two landmarks.

00:01:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Or put differently, in this part over here our matrix will always be a diagonal matrix.
