00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.807
y equals 3x plus 4 has a y-intercept of 0 4, which is this point right here and

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.415
a slope of 3, which makes it really steep. So, it must be this line, which is

00:00:11.427 --> 00:00:17.110
line g, so I'll check that one off. y equals 19 is a horizontal line that is

00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:24.913
located 19 units above the x-axis. So, if you go 19 up, we hit line d. So, those

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:27.883
are the two lines we need.
