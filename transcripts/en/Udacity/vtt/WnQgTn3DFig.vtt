00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is sending all of the ki values would be sufficient.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Those are the values that the bank would need to unblind the messages,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
because the bank can decrypt all the messages using its private key

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and then divide out the k raised to the eB power from the results.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It would be okay to send this, but there's no need.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There's no security loss in sending the ri values except for the one from message x,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but the bank is going to learn those anyway.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Since after it divides out to ki^eB power, it has all these values.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
At the end of this protocol, Alice will be able to compute message x signed by the bank.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now, Alice can spend the bill, give it to Cathy.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Cathy can verify the signature, and she could deposit the bill in the bank.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The bank checks if this ID has not been spent before and believes that it's a valid bill.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If Alice spends the bill again, when Doug gives it to the bank,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the bank checks the signature but finds that this ri value was previously used.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The bank knows the bill was double spent.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The problem is the bank doesn't know who double spent the bill.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The bank received the bills from Cathy and Doug, but they weren't the double spenders.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
They were the ones that were duped in the accepting the bill.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Alice was the double spender, and because of this blind signature scheme,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the bank doesn't know that Alice is the one who spent the bill, and so for this approach to work,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we need a way to trace the double-spent bill back to the person who double spent it,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
but we also want the bills to be anonymous so that sounds like a contradictory property.

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
There's actually a way to achieve this.
