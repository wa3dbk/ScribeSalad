00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.052
&gt;&gt; So with this distribution do you think the first quartile will be here at

00:00:05.052 --> 00:00:10.409
25000? Or will it be to the left or to the right? This might be a kind of tough

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:15.793
question. But try your best. And keep in mind that we're trying to divide the

00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:21.337
data into four equal groups.And the first quartile divdes the first group from

00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:22.581
the other three.
