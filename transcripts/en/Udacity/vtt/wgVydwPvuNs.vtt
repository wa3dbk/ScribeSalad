1.2 times 4 is 4.8. We multiple this by 10th to the 15, since 8 plus 7 is 15.

00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:12.790
There's one important thing we need to note here. Using this method, your

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.145
answer is not always going to end up in scientific notation, since sometimes,

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:21.433
depending what two numbers we have multiplied here, this number won't end up

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:26.890
being between 1 and 10. So, make sure that if you decide to use this method,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.725
you look at the final answer and double check that it is in fact in scientific

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:34.029
notation. If it's not, adjust it properly.
