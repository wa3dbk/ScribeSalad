00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.230
Let's now talk about data center networking

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.380
and how network operators perform traffic engineering

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.460
inside a data center. First of all,

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.100
what characterizes a data center? Data center network

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.061
has 3 important characteristics. One is multi-tenancy.

00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:19.350
Multi-tenancy allows a data center provider to

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.390
advertise the cost of shared infrastructure, but

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.430
because there are multiple independent users, the infrastructure

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.720
must also provide some level of security and resource isolation. Data Center

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.810
network resources are also elastic, meaning

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.060
that as demand for service fluctuates, the

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.880
operator can expand and contract these resources. It's also, can be pay per use,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:50.530
meaning that as the need to use more resources arises or disappears,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.080
a service provider can adjust how much resources are devoted to the particular

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.170
service running in the data center. Another

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.370
characteristic of data center networking is flexible

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.035
service management, or the ability to move work, or work loads to other

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:12.970
locations inside the data center. For example,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.990
as load changes for a particular service,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.520
an operator may need to provision additional

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.990
virtual machines, or servers to handle the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.970
load for that service or potentially move it to a completely different set of

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.220
servers inside the infrastructure. This workload movement and virtual machine

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.300
migration essentially creates the need for traffic engineering

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.050
solutions inside a data center. A key enabling technology in

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.340
data center networking is the ability to virtualize servers. This makes it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.590
possible to quickly provision, move, and

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.220
migrate servers and services in response to

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.100
fluctuations in workload. But while provisioning

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.480
servers and moving them is relatively easy,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.260
we must also develop traffic engineering

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.790
solutions that allow the network to reconfigure

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.030
in response to changing workloads and migrating services.
