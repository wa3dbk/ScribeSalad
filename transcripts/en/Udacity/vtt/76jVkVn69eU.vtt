In the course so far, we have looked at analyzing problems, modeling them in

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.540
UML, and designing architectural solutions. Now we want to look at the actual

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.790
process of designing objects. To get started, we will do an exercise from

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.820
Robert Martin that involves designing software to control a coffee maker.
