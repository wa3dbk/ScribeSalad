00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.820
So when this was first put together
here's an old cast of characters.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.030
And there's two funny things for
me to tell you.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.420
The first is, you talk about, you know,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.160
missing a trademarking opportunity,
right?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.140
So when Matt Turk and
Sandy Panaro were putting this together.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.410
They had in mind this
notion of mug shot books.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.230
You know, mug shots, where page through
this book of all these face images, and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.080
you say, aha, that's the person.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.930
So they were putting together something
that was going to be kind of like

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.270
a mug shot book, but of faces, and it
was going to be an electronic program.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.290
So what do you think they called
this electronic program that was

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.290
supposed to be a book of faces?

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.850
Photo book [LAUGH].

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.950
So, you know, there you go Zuckerberg.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.132
Hope you're happy.

00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:47.042
Facebook was invented and
called photo book and so

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:48.610
then Facebook could be Facebook.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.800
So that's humorous story number one.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.900
Humorous story number two is
actually not humorous at all.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.650
It actually speaks to, sort of,
the productivity of the media lab.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.100
The vision and
modeling group at the time.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.410
This, old cast of characters here,
bunch of these people were students,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.690
in fact almost all of these people
here were students at the time.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.020
Oh, and there's Mike Boe.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.420
He was a research scientist.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.040
But, some of you may
know Astand Sclaroff,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.140
who was chair of,
Boston University Computer Science.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.540
Well, that's him right there.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.330
Some of you, ever heard of G Plus?

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.130
All right?

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.140
So Bradley Horowitz at Google was
instrumental in making that happen.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.590
He's right there.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.170
I think that's him or is that him?

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.340
Those two may be the same person.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.150
Okay?

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.360
Anybody up in Berkley?

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.890
Trevor Darrell?

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.480
Computer vision researcher, or

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.490
here at Georgia Tech,
there's Professor Irfan Essa.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.200
Neither he nor I look like we used to
look like when we were at the media lab

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600
at the time but that really is him.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.140
So it just tells you a little bit about

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.310
sort of the density of interesting
vision research going on at the time.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.290
But basically what they did was produced
a database of eight thousand faces and

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.770
it was able to do recognition.
