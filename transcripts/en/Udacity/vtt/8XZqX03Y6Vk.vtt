00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.752
So now, remember that we said approximately 95% of sample means will fall

00:00:04.752 --> 00:00:09.478
between this interval. 2 times sigma divided by the square root of n is

00:00:09.478 --> 00:00:15.166
approximately our margin of error. But let's now use exact values. So, in any

00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:19.918
normal distribution where the mean is mu, we know that approximately 95% of the

00:00:19.918 --> 00:00:27.720
data is within two standard deviations of the mean. But what's the exact number

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.833
of standard deviations that bounds 95% of the data?
