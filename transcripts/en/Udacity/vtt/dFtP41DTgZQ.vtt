00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.767
So now we're going to turn to the parallel reduce.

00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:08.863
So how do we formulate an algorithm, a procedure to be able to speed this up by running in parallel?

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:11.789
Let's take a look at this reduce picture here.

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.127
At first glance this seems very difficult to parallelize.

00:00:15.127 --> 00:00:20.819
Note that every operation is dependent on the result of the previous operation.

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:23.772
So let's write these operations explicitly.

00:00:23.772 --> 00:00:28.313
When we formulate the reduction in this way, we have no parallelism.

00:00:28.313 --> 00:00:32.202
So can you figure out how to rewrite this to expose more parallelism

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:35.202
so that we can do more than 1 thing at the same time?

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.652
And the hint is, use the associative property of the operator.

00:00:38.652 --> 00:00:44.086
How do you rewrite a + b, take the result, add it to c, take the result. add it to d,

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:46.234
to allow parallel execution?

00:00:46.234 --> 00:00:49.009
In your answer please use parentheses to show grouping.
