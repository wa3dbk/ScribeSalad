00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.920
I'd like you to keep getting more practice using long division, so let's do

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.260
this problem as well. This time we're starting out with x cubed minus 1, and

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.606
I'd like us to divide that by x minus 1. How do you write this using long

00:00:11.606 --> 00:00:15.560
division though? Well, you might think it would be this way, like before all

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.840
I've done is taken the thing we want to divide, written our lovely long

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.213
division surrounding it. And then written the thing we want to divide it by

00:00:22.213 --> 00:00:25.905
outside. This isn't going to work quite right in this situation of this

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:30.268
polynomial though. Here's why. We only have two terms here, but this is a cubic

00:00:30.268 --> 00:00:34.233
polynomial. With other cubic's we've worked with, we've had a term for every

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:38.635
single power starting with the highest power and descending. This time we don't

00:00:38.635 --> 00:00:41.915
have an x squared term and we don't have an x term. In order to do long

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:45.179
division properly though, we still need to leave slots for those terms In the

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.250
expression that we start out with. Instead we're going to need to write the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.950
polynomial like this. Note that by writing 0x squared and 0x for the x squared

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.753
and x terms, we're not changing the value of the original expression we had

00:00:56.753 --> 00:01:02.647
underneath the division sign. But we are still leaving room for the terms of

00:01:02.647 --> 00:01:07.180
these powers. Now we're in great shape to do our division. So let's do it!

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.899
