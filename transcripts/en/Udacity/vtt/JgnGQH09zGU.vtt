I'd like to have you give the over operator a try now. So you have a reddish

00:00:04.498 --> 00:00:12.682
filter of 0.9, 0.2, 0.1, red, green, blue, and a yellowish background 0.9, 0.9,

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:17.891
0.4. You set the filter to have an alpha of 0.7, fairly opaque. What is the

00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:20.289
resulting color when you use the over operator?
