00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.188
Let's see how we would do this in BlueJ. Here's the loop that we had before,

00:00:03.188 --> 00:00:06.048
which used zero to decide when to quit, but now we want to go as long as

00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:10.867
there's another double. We can use the hasNextDouble method to ask the scanner

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:15.098
if the next token it has is a double. Then we basically want to do the same

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:19.220
stuff as before, right, asking for input and adding it to the sum in counting.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.102
Let's just try this. Hm, still running, still running. Okay, I think there's a

00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:30.114
bug here. So, let's stop this. Look at the code again. Where could this have

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:33.892
got stuck? I've never seen simple variable assignments like this get stuck

00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:38.256
before. So, I think that's not the problem. Now, here I check if there's

00:00:38.256 --> 00:00:41.710
another double. Oh, there isn't another double, because I haven't asked for one

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.050
yet. So, I'll need to ask the user for a double before I check if there is

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.470
another double. And now, I'll have to ask again somewhere in the loop. I don't

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.520
want to ask immediately because then I'll ask twice. So, I probably want to ask

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.663
at the end, after I process the value I already asked for. Let's test this

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:06.930
again. I can enter three, and four, and zero. Well, it looks like this message

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.600
isn't right yet. But, if I add a q then I get my average back. That's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.370
interesting. This is the average of only the first two numbers, it didn't

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.590
include the zero, I guess we're still not there yet. We're only incrementing

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.420
the count if the value is not zero.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.756
[LAUGH]

00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:25.449
We've also got this cruft with the done, we're not going to need that anymore.

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:30.432
So, I'll take out everything associated with done. Now, let's see. We have the

00:01:30.432 --> 00:01:35.976
user enter something If it's a number, we read it in, add it to the sum, count,

00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:43.372
and ask for another one. This is probably what we wanted. Now, if I enter

00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:47.729
three, four, and zero, that's better.
