00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
And, of course, there's going to be more challenging quizzes here,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.510
but for a warmup I think it is very good to understand the difference

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.480
between computability and complexity theory.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.250
The first question, how fast a computer can find a way between 2 points on a map,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.880
belongs in complexity theory because here it's a question of resources.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.430
So "how fast," that is a question about the time that a computer needs,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.990
and therefore, investigating this question belongs in complexity theory.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.300
Asking if a program can decide if another program is malware,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.640
that belongs in computability because we are not asking

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.960
about any resources, we're just if it's possible in principle.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.780
We're asking, "Can a program do that?"

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.350
We're not asking how fast or with how much memory it can do that.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.790
In the third question we are, again, asking about resources.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.290
We're asking about how much memory, and therefore, this 1 belongs in complexity theory.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.840
The question about memory is something we are not going to look at much in this course.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.460
Actually, I think we are not going to look at it at all.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.770
We're going to be concerned mostly with time, how fast a computer can solve a given problem,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.470
and, toward the end of this unit, we are going to pose the ultimate resource question

00:01:11.470 --> 99:59:59.000
and ask, "What are the limits of computation in general?
