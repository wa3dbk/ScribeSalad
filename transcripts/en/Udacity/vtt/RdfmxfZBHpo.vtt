00:00:00.107 --> 00:00:04.654
Our next implementation is an inclusive scan that was popularized in a 1986 paper

00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:08.749
by Danny Hillis and Guy Steele, who are 2 really interesting people.

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.912
Danny Hillis founded a company that built a massively parallel computer

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:15.459
called the Thinking Machine, which had scan as one of its core primitives

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.868
and awesome-looking blinky lights.

00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:19.797
He designed it for AI applications

00:00:19.797 --> 00:00:23.235
and said that his goal was to build a computer that was proud of him.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.435
At Thinking Machines he worked with Guy Steele,

00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:28.019
who developed the Scheme programming language at MIT

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.519
and later was one of the core developers of Java.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.618
Anyway, back to scan and this particular algorithm,

00:00:33.618 --> 00:00:36.317
the easiest way to show it is simply to draw it.

00:00:36.317 --> 00:00:40.735
So we're going to start with an input array that's simply the numbers 1 to 8.

00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:45.830
So the 1st stage of this algorithm involves adding yourself to your neighbor 1 away.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:53.645
So for instance, 1 + 2 is going to give you 3, 2 + 3 is going to give you 5, and so on.

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:55.239
Then we come back to the beginning,

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.605
and anything that doesn't have a left neighbor, we just copy its value down.

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:02.940
Stage 2 is going to involve adding yourself to your neighbor 2 to the left,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.081
so let's see how that's going to work.

00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:09.346
1 + 5 gives you 6, 3 + 7 gives you 10, and so on.

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:13.660
And again, if you don't have a neighbor 2 to the left, then you just copy your value down.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.542
Final stage, now you're going to add yourself to your neighbor 4 to the left,

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:21.631
so we add 1 and 14, giving us 15,

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:26.248
we add 3 and 18 and give us 21, and so on.

00:01:26.248 --> 00:01:28.732
And again, if you don't have a neighbor 4 to the left,

00:01:28.732 --> 00:01:33.270
then you'll just copy your own value down. And now, take a look at what we got.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.807
This bottom row here is the inclusive scan of the top row here.

00:01:37.807 --> 00:01:43.514
So what's the algorithm that we used here? Starting with step 0, here's the steps here.

00:01:43.514 --> 00:01:49.372
On step i, your job at each location is to add yourself to your neighbor to the left,

00:01:49.372 --> 00:01:55.229
2 to the i hops away, so here 1 hop away, here 2 hops away, and here 4 hops away.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.635
And if you don't have a neighbor that far to the left,

00:01:57.635 --> 00:02:00.663
you just copy yourself from the previous iteration.

00:02:00.663 --> 00:02:04.901
So as a quiz, let's analyze the complexity of this computation.

00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:10.389
So as a function of n, the input size, how much work are we going to do in this algorithm,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.277
and how many steps is it going to take?
