00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.360
What if we want to run
two versions of nginx.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.740
What happens when we install it again?

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.070
Using our Package Manager,
let's try to install nginx again.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.400
It says it's already installed and
we have the newest version.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.420
So, that's not how you do it.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.510
Let's try starting nginx again and
checking the status.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.950
I still only see one
instance of nginx running.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.680
And we can confirm this
using the ps command.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.140
I can see that there is only one
nginx process and it's worker.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.100
So that tells me there's only one main
instance of my application running.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.105
So, without going into all the details,
to create two instances of

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:46.195
nginx using native OS tools,
we'll need to modify init scripts.

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:47.995
It takes a lot more work.

00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:51.297
In particular,
you have to modify this file.

00:00:51.297 --> 00:00:54.367
We'd also need to manage ports
because two instances can't

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:56.247
bind to the same port.

00:00:56.247 --> 00:01:00.377
There's a lot of complexity here and
that's not even considering how

00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:03.538
to run a newer and
older version of nginx at the same time.

00:01:04.678 --> 00:01:07.448
Most OSs only allow you
to run one version.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:12.698
So we're going to have to change things
up a bit and take a different approach.

00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:14.788
So let's stop nginx.
