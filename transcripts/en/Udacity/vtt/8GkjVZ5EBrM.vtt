00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.140
In the previous quiz questions,

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.910
you used your intuition to read
through some if else statements.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.040
You figured out what different
messages would be printed to the logs

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.870
based on certain conditions.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.585
Now let's look into these
statements more formally.

00:00:13.585 --> 00:00:16.420
If/else statements are called
control flow statements.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.770
It's named this way because instead of
a linear flow of code where one line of

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.850
code is being executed after another,
the control flow statement actually

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.490
allows us to jump to different parts of
the code based on certain conditions.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.280
So if this condition is true,
meaning the Boolean variable

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.240
was set to true up here somewhere,
then these statements will be executed.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.170
And it will skip this block of code.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.970
If this condition is false,
then we execute these lines of code, and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.800
then resume the normal linear
flow of code after that.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.560
Looking at our vocab word glossary,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.670
we can look up the phrase
if/else statement.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.940
One way to think about this is to
use an analogy of a train track.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.370
A train track has a switch so
that given a certain condition,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.180
the train will go one way or the other.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.510
Similarly in the if/else statement,
if this condition is true,

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.840
then we'll execute one path of code.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.780
If the statement is false, then we'll
execute a different path of code.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.210
And then afterwards, we're going to
resume the normal flow of code.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.440
The if statement is the simplest
control flow statement.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.150
Notice the syntax here.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.550
We start with the word if, and then we
have parentheses around the condition.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.260
And then we have an opening brace, and

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.680
then a closing brace at the end
of that if block of code.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.820
In this example of a pizza ordering app,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.065
if the user wants the order to be
delivered to their home, then we're

00:01:36.065 --> 00:01:39.590
going to adjust the price to add five
extra dollars for the delivery charge.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.760
Otherwise, if the order is not for
delivery, then we just

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.420
skip this line of code, and we don't
add the extra charge for delivery.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.160
Then in these subsequent lines of code,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.108
we can use the totalPrice
variable with the correct value.

00:01:52.108 --> 00:01:54.475
Now the if/else statement
is a little more advanced.

00:01:54.475 --> 00:01:57.026
If the condition in
the parentheses is true,

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:59.116
then we execute these lines of code.

00:01:59.116 --> 00:02:01.880
Then we skip this and
then continue with the rest of the code.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.120
So in this game app,
if the user has zero points,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.774
then we're going to update
the textView to say Loser.

00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:11.570
And we're going to update
the imageView to be a sad face.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.922
However, if the condition is false,
the person has, for example, 100 points,

00:02:15.922 --> 00:02:18.280
then we're going to skip
this block of code, and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.466
we're going to go down
here to the else case.

00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:23.001
We're going to update the textView
to show the word Winner, and

00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:25.496
then we're going to update
the imageView to show a happy face.

00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:27.656
Then we're going to continue
with these lines of code here.

00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:31.642
As you can see, the code inside the if
statement can contain as many lines of

00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:34.504
code as we want,
similarly with the else statement.

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:38.890
If we want more than two possible code
paths, we can use an else if statement.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.770
You can have as many else
if blocks as you want,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.000
and then you could just end
with an else at the very end.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.410
But again, all these else if and
else blocks are optional.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.486
In our code here, we can fall into one
of three possible cases depending on

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:54.066
the value of the integer
variable itemCount.

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:58.275
itemCount just represents the number of
items in the shopping cart in our app.

00:02:58.275 --> 00:02:59.788
Let's start with the first condition.

00:02:59.788 --> 00:03:04.874
If itemCount is 12, then 12 is
greater than 10, so that is true.

00:03:04.874 --> 00:03:09.230
And then we would execute the lines
of code within this block of code.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.070
We would create a Toast message
that says, You get 20% off, and

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.580
show it at the bottom of the screen.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.090
Since we fell into this case, then we
skip this block and this block, and

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.480
then we continue with
the rest of the code.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.401
What would happen if the shopping
cart only had two items in it?

00:03:25.401 --> 00:03:28.686
Well, then itemCount would
not be greater than ten.

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:32.218
So this would be false, and we would
skip this block of code here and

00:03:32.218 --> 00:03:34.376
then jump down to the else if statement.

00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:37.883
Then we would check if two is
greater than zero, and it is,

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:40.114
so then we would fall into this case.

00:03:40.114 --> 00:03:42.868
We would show a Toast message that says,
Thank you.

00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:45.610
Since we fell into this case,
we're going to skip this one, and

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.105
then we can continue with
the rest of the code.

00:03:48.105 --> 00:03:50.587
And lastly if our shopping
cart had zero items,

00:03:50.587 --> 00:03:54.385
then this condition would be false
because zero is not greater than ten.

00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:58.422
This condition would be false because
zero is not greater than zero.

00:03:58.422 --> 00:04:01.330
And then we would fall
into this else case here.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.250
And we would show a message that says,
You have an empty cart.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.610
If you ever need a reminder of
the syntax of any of these statements,

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.060
you can just check the official
Java documentation.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.240
It tells you about the if statement,
and here's an example.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.560
And then it also shows you that if
else statement and here's the example.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.570
And lastly there is an example
with else if statements.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.940
Based on everything that
I've shown you so far,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.145
you're probably realizing that Java has
a special use for the words if and else.

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:35.390
They're Java keywords and they're used
to control how the code is executed.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.220
So you can't use these
as variable names.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.420
&gt;From the examples that I showed you, you
also may have started to realize that we

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.260
put different expressions in
this test condition here.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.960
Any expression is valid as long
as evaluates to true or false.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.730
So we can put a Boolean variable in
the test condition or, for example,

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.390
we can compare two values.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.995
We can compare two values using any of
these equality and relational operators.

00:04:57.995 --> 00:05:00.880
We can test that two images
are equal to each other, or

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.400
not equal to each other, or greater or
less than equal to each other.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.570
And here are examples of
different test conditions.
