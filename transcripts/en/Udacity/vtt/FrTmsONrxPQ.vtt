00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.328
The slope of this line right here is negative. Notice that slope as we defined

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.577
it, is the increase in y divided by the increase in x. But as x increases over

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.930
here on our graph, y actually steps downward. We can't draw a triangle like we

00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:20.560
did before, or rather, we can draw a triangle, just a different triangle. We

00:00:20.572 --> 00:00:24.975
have to notice that as we walk over to the right, we walk down instead of up.

00:00:25.077 --> 00:00:28.435
This means that our slope is negative instead of positive.
