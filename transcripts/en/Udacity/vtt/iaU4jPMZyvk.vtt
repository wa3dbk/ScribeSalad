00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.090
In Lesson One we learned that a genome

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.340
provides genetic instructions for traits and both of these

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.750
can be influenced by the environment. Genome is actually

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.700
made of DNA, which we'll learn more about in

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.379
Lesson Two. The genome is inherited as individual units.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.800
We mentioned they're called genes, which we'll learn about

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.090
in a future lesson. And traits are also inherited.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.010
And both traits and genomes are inherited from parents.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.720
And from parents, they're passed on to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.350
children. Traits can be categorized as either

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.280
hidden or visible. Physical or behavioral. And

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.810
innate or learned. There can be many variants

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.190
of any given trait. And generally, they're

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.160
separated into 2 categories, as either being

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.210
preferred or good traits. Or undesired or

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.270
bad traits. Now obviously these words are relative

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.130
to each other and they can have different meanings depending on who you ask.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.060
Usually we reserve the term undesired or bad only for traits that cause or

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.900
variance of traits that cause sickness or

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.739
death. Also remember that traits are inherited

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.060
and they can skip generations. They can

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.260
appear undilluted but they can also blend.
