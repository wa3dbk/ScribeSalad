00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.040
I asked my first Android question on Stack Overflow, on August 25, 2008.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.080
Was about a problem I was having on the 0.9 Android Beta SDK.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.250
Android has evolved quickly since then, and

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.560
no where is there more power than here, in the Android Dessert Sculpture garden,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.150
at the very heart of Android, building 44 at Google HQ.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.580
More than just a convenient place to take a photo with a life-size sculpture of

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.400
your favorite dessert, it also tells the history of Android. In terms of food,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.850
every Android launch has two things in common. Work from work, Bacon Sundays,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.070
and the crunch time leading up to each launch. And a dessert themed code named

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.106
memorialized forever here, in the Android Dessert Sculpture garden.

00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:49.447
[NOISE] Each release brings with it new hardware, APIs, and features for

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:53.954
developers to play with. The third major Android release, 1.5 or Cupcake,

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:58.162
as it was code named, brought video recording and widgets to the Android SDK,

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:03.580
and the first baked good to our front lawn. Android 1.6 and 2.0 brought with

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.770
them giant donuts and eclairs as well as support for different screen sizes, and

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.670
tracking multiple simultaneous touch points. The biggest challenge for

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.940
Android 2.2 was coming up with a baked dessert starting with the letter F.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.400
A challenge we ultimately ignored,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.900
instead introducing this giant bowl of froyo to the neighborhood.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.125
Along with that, in cloud's device messaging to the platform.

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:31.320
[NOISE] That brings us to Android 2.3, and this giant life-size gingerbread man,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.067
along with system support for barometers, gyroscopes and NFC.

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:40.300
Android 3.0 was the Honeycomb release. The first one targeted, specifically for

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.020
tablet's and paving the way for Android 4.0. Android 4,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.460
Ice Cream Sandwich brought phones and tablet's back together. It also introduced

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.320
Android Beam, and everyone's favorite font, roboto. Android 4.1 Jelly Bean

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.240
was the first platform release to feature rich expandable notifications.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.900
It's also the first sculpture to spontaneously combust thanks to a version one

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.120
design, that we've since patented as a solar powered pressure cooker. But

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.473
that's another story. [NOISE] Which brings us to the newest member of our team,

00:02:13.473 --> 00:02:18.774
Android 4.4, Kit-Kat. With sensor batching, host card emulation and an API for

00:02:18.774 --> 00:02:23.750
text messaging. So how do the dessert names get decided? Well ultimately,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.800
the only real rule is sequential lettering. Then it's down to intense lobbying,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.940
threats, bribery and [UNKNOWN] on the ease of spelling, cultural resonance and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.630
statuability of each proposal. Eventually something just sort of sticks.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.810
Even then, we can surprise ourselves. Take a look at the GIT history for

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.820
the K release, and you'll see that even KitKat wasn't always KitKat. As for

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.670
what comes next, we'll have to wait and

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.890
see what the next statue is, before we know for sure.
