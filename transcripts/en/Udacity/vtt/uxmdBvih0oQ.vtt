All right, so by now you should
have a fairly decent sized list

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.189
of apps that you might be
interested in pursuing.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.970
See if you can whittle that down
to about three that you would be

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.160
super excited to work on.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.350
And, once you've done that, it's
time to get feedback on these ideas.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.380
One of the most important parts of iOS
app development is to get feedback

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.030
early and often.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.390
So let's do that.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.990
Go ahead and
post your three app ideas to the forum

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.290
along with descriptions on
what you want them to do.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.430
While you're there, respond to
two of your classmates posts and

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.970
give them feedback.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.340
And then, while you're waiting for

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.280
feedback, share your app ideas
with your friends and family.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.490
What do they think?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.610
Now go forth.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.970
Give feedback.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.650
I mean it.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.510
Shoo.
Get out of here.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.350
Get out of class.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.160
Go talk to people.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.430
See what they think.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.000
It'll really help you decide what
you want to pursue in the end.
