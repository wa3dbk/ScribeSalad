00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.005
We going to wrap this lesson up with one last question. What proportion of the

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.628
difference in pairs of shoes owned can be attributed to gender? In other words,

00:00:08.628 --> 00:00:12.786
you found that the difference between the pairs of shoes owned on average by

00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:18.516
our sample of males and females, was about 15. How much of this difference can

00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:24.174
be explained by the fact that some are males and some are female? This is found

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:28.614
by r squared, which is the ratio of our t-statistic squared, divided by t

00:00:28.614 --> 00:00:32.619
squared plus the degrees of freedom.
