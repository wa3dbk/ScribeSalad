00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.339
I'm going to convert this equation into slope-intercept form. So first I'm going

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.764
to add 2x to both sides, because I want to isolate y. I get negative 3y equals 6

00:00:10.764 --> 00:00:15.747
plus 2x and I can rewrite this side by switching the terms around. Then I

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:21.129
divivde each term by negative 3 to get 1y is equal to negative 2 3rds x minus 2.

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:25.293
Notice, I have one negative sign here, and one negative sign here, so both of

00:00:25.293 --> 00:00:29.574
these terms need to be negative. Alright, now, I'm ready to graph. I know my y

00:00:29.574 --> 00:00:33.741
intercept is at negative 2, so I go two units down on the y-axis. I know my

00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:37.969
slope is negative 2 3rd. I'm going to put the negative sign with the 2, which

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.311
means I move down two units and right three units. If I move down two units and

00:00:42.311 --> 00:00:46.422
right three units, I end up here, at this point. This wasn't one of the boxes

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:50.620
down here, so these are out. We could continue moving two units down and three

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.830
units right to get other points down in this region. So, I have two points and I

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.192
know my line should like this. But how do I get the other points up here? Well,

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:03.680
I assign the negative to the 2. What if I put the negative instead with a 3? In

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.889
this case, the 2 would be positive and I would move up two, and the 3 would be

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:12.343
negative, and I would move left three. If I start from my y-intercept and move

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:16.567
two units up and three units left, I end up at this point here. When working

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:21.187
with slope, the positive and negative signs always indicate the directions we

00:01:21.187 --> 00:01:25.987
need to move. Two points determine line and the third one is like our insurance,

00:01:25.987 --> 00:01:30.415
so if I connect these, I should get a line. So here is the line that represents

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:32.433
our linear equation, pretty cool.
