00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.290
So, let's look at an example of fabrication costs.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.893
Suppose that the cost of manufacturing a wafer is $5,000. So,

00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:12.970
we pay $5,000 to manufacture a whole wafer and cut it up into chips.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.630
Let's consider what happens when you have some really small chips so

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.500
that we can fit 400 of them on a wafer. And then we want to manufacture large

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.430
chips that are four times the size of the small chips. So, now you would think.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.369
That we would have 100 of those on our wafer. But because the wafer is round and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.590
the chips are square, we lose some chips along the edge.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.040
So let's say that we can fit only 96 of these large chips on our wafer.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.940
And finally we will consider huge chips that are four times again. So

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.699
they're four times. The size of the large chip and

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.982
then 24 of them would be a quarter of this. But because, again,

00:00:55.982 --> 00:01:00.841
the wafer is round and the chip is square we lose some more along the edges. So

00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:05.110
let's say only 20 of them can fit on a wafer. And

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.280
let us also suppose that there are 10 defects on each wafer.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.430
What we want to compute is what's the manufacturing cost of a small large and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.170
huge chip. The chip cost will be the $5,000 for

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.120
a wafer divided by how many good chips we get per wafer.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.578
So now for our small chips, what we get. Is that the cost is equal to

00:01:30.578 --> 00:01:37.360
$5,000 divided by, we have 400 chips on a wafer.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.520
But we lose 10 to defects, so we really have $5,000 for 390 chips.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.670
And that gives us a cost of $12.80 to manufacture a working chip.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.330
For a large chip, we get the cost to be $5,000 divided

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.540
by 96 of them fit on a chip. But again, these defects are going to be on

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.210
the wafer, and they will affect 10 of our chips, so we lose 10 to the defects.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.360
So we end up we paying $5,000 for manufacturing and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.690
get only 86 working chips. So we get $58.20 as the cost of our chips,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.340
so note that our chip is only four times the size of a small chip.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.270
But the cost is about five times the cost of a smaller chip. And finally for

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.490
our huge chip. The cost is going to be $5,000,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.328
we get only 20 chips fabricated. And now there are ten defects on a wafer.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:46.894
But with chips this big, it seems likely that maybe two of these defects

00:02:46.894 --> 00:02:51.464
are going to end up on the same chip. So instead of losing ten chips to defects,

00:02:51.464 --> 00:02:56.690
because each defect effects a whole chip. Let's say that we only lose

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.450
nine chips because of this defense. So we put in $5,000 and manufacture only

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.140
11 chips that work. This is much more than four times the cost of a large chip.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.680
This means really that if you're fabricating chips that are really large,.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.330
Any slight increase or decrease in chip size is going to significantly change

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.530
the cost. We have seen that here the difference was five times instead of four.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.560
Here the difference is almost ten times instead of four. So

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.790
if this is what manufacturing cost look like and if we combine this

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.340
with what Moore's law gives us. Which is we can fit more stuff on the same chip.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.955
We really have two choices when we get a generation of Moore's Law to play for

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:47.275
us. One, we can have a smaller chip that does exactly the same things that

00:03:47.275 --> 00:03:53.113
a larger chip could do previously because now we can make things smaller. And,

00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:59.470
as you can see, getting things smaller gives us much lower cost.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.170
So one way of benefiting from Moore's Law, is to getting smaller, and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.160
thus a lot cheaper than before while keeping the same functionality.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.580
The other way of benefiting from Moore's Law, is to build something new that has

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.029
the same area as old thing. And that means that we get something faster, and

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:23.600
more capable for the same cost that the old thing had. So,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.820
if we are interested in high performance processors, typically we will do this.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.580
But if we are interested in doing something that could not be done before,

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.960
then this is what we usually benefit from. Take a cell phone for example.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.140
Early on, what we wanted to put in a cellphone, could not be very smart,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.370
so we had, non-smartphones. Eventually, the processor that would be

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.560
required to make a smartphone, became small enough. To put in a cell phone and

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.910
also cheap enough so that we can afford it, and that's when we

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.530
started having cell phones. Similar things occurred with digital watches, and

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.460
all sort of things where eventually what we want will fit

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.900
in where we want it. It's just a matter of how long do we need to wait for it,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.980
because of this, because. Whatever functionality we need,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.130
will eventually be cheap enough and small enough to fit.
