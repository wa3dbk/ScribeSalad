00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.380
This book contains a patterns catalog which is

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.725
a number of design patterns classified by purpose. And

00:00:06.725 --> 00:00:09.122
there are five main classes of patterns. There are

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:11.890
fundamental patterns which are the basic patterns. There are

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.170
creational patterns which are the patterns that support object

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.290
creation. Then there are structural patterns and these are

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.090
patterns that help compose objects, put objects together. The

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.280
next class of patterns are behavioral patterns and these

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.840
are patterns that are mostly focused on realizing interactions

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.820
among different objects. Finally, there are concurrency patterns and these

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.400
are patterns that support, as the name says, concurrency, so

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.700
they're more related to concurrency aspects. And for each of

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.560
these classes there are a number of specific patterns, and

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.130
here I'm just listing some of them. Clearly we cannot

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.740
cover in one lesson all of these patterns, but what

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.440
I want to do is to cover at least a few

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.670
of those to give an idea of what patterns are and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.430
how they can be used. In particular, we will see in

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.200
detail the Factory Method Pattern and the Strategy Pattern. And we

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.590
will also discuss a few more patterns at a higher level.
