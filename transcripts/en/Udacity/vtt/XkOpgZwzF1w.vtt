00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.320
Active networks was way ahead of its time, and there was not a killer app to

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.960
justify this particular line of thought. Further, active networks focused more

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.470
on safety and less on performance, so in the 90s it seemed more like

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.570
a solution looking for a problem. But

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.840
difficulties with network management, rise of virtualization,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.590
the right hardware support and data center and cloud computing have all

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.400
given active networks a new lease of life in the form of Software Defined

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.840
Networking or SDN for short. Specifically,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.680
cloud computing promotes a model of utility

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.430
computing where multiple tenants, by that I

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.100
mean businesses, can host their respective corporate

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.930
networks simultaneously on the same computational

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.070
resources of a data center. Not that

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.390
this is going to ever happen but

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.040
imagine Coke and Pepsi, corporate networks running

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.630
on the same data center resources. What this means is there is a need

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.290
for perfect isolation, of the network traffic of one business from another,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.930
even though each of the network traffic is flowing on the same

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.190
physical infrastructure. This calls for virtualization

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.750
of the physical network itself, and hence

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.070
the term, software defined networking. You will learn more about SDN if you

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.210
take a companion course on networking that is offered in this same program.
