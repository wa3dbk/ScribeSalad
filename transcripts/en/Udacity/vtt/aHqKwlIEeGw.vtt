00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The next question was about handling the final slash because

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
it's technically a different URL and what the best way to handle that is.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Ending URLs in slash--honestly, I don't know the correct answer.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I usually make my websites not care.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You've seen in my URL mapping I have a regular expression that looks like this--/blog/?.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And what this basically says is this will map the URL/blog,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and then it will also match it that has the trailing slash, which I think it's what most friendly way to do it,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because some browsers will automatically add the slash or users will add a slash.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They have a way of creeping up, and you don't want to have like /blogwork/44 or vice versa

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
because you make a lot of people hates it, so I just make it optional.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now, you can do this thing--sometimes, and I've been working on this on the final project

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
where the URLs are going to be a little bit more dynamic.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I usually have regular a expression that looks something like this:

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
/+ or it's like .../+ or // or something like that.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Basically, I detect the situation where URL ends in a bunch of slashes.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And then I have this go to some handler that automatically redirects with single-slash version

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
or redirects to a zero-slash version.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Depending on your websites, that's kind of handy.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The question that somebody asked, they basically proposed,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
"Should I do it this way? or "Should I have a redirect way?.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The answer is, it depends on web app.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Do whatever feels right, but it's a great question to ask, because it is something you should think about.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You should try to make both versions work.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It could be the case that /blog is the blog and / has got more content.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It's kind of a hierarchical view your website--that's fine--but think about it, and it is pretty easy.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Generally, you just add a question mark and forget about it. I hope that helps.
