00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.140
The answer is friends equals friends dot replace. Friend name and a space with

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.350
an empty string. We can look at an example to see how this works. So if this

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.960
person is Maria and this person is TJ. If we call Maria dot unfriend TJ, we'll

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.630
come into this method and we'll be doing it for this object. First thing that

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.000
happens is we call friends dot replace friend dot name with a space after it,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.970
and then replace it with an empty string. Friends is initially TJ Jamesha. And

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.210
friend dot name, whoops, that's actually an error, it should be nonfriend dot

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.819
name. Do you think that's a compile time error, or a run time error? I'll just

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:45.890
fix it. So nonfriend, aas TJ dot name is the string with TJ and nothing else.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.796
And then we're adding that together with another space. So we look for the TJ

00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:57.820
space and friends, and we replace it with an empty string. So this creates a

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.946
new string, Jamesha with a space. And now we take that string and we make

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:10.960
friends, which again was Maria is friends. Stop pointing at TJ Jamesha, and

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.335
point at just Jamesha with a space.
