00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.905
Couple things to show you ,first let
me just show you this kind of works.

00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:07.840
Allright, here's some optic flow results
taken from a computer vision class 2003

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.973
from a actually it's a tutorial.

00:00:09.973 --> 00:00:14.750
Here listed on the bottom and you can
see that when you run loops at the,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.070
on that front tree without kermits,
you get sort of terrible results and

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.350
while when you run it with the pyramid
you get a much better result.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.000
And our goal is to really
get that much better result.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.460
But before we can do this we have
to talk a little bit more about

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.580
multiple scale.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.450
So we been having all this
multiple scale stuff.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.010
Now this isn't going to surprise
you that it relates to some of

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.160
the aliasing stuff and frequency
stuff that we talked about, oh God,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.700
sounds like, found,
feels like months ago.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.010
It's probably months ago.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.040
I have no idea when it was.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.000
Anyway when we were talking about
Fourier analysis in different scale.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.210
And what we're going to do now is take
a little detour through multi scale and

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.345
then we'll come back to Lucas and
Canoti.

00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:54.280
Allright, so,
we talked about aliasing, and

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.130
now I want to show you aliasing in,
in terms of image sub-sampling, okay?

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.470
So image sub-sampling is what,
we talked about it,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.630
you just throw away
some number of pixels.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.730
So here we have a a nice,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.580
I sure hope it's in public domain,
picture by Van Gogh.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.190
This is one where you can see his ear.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.560
So on the other side,
I guess, there's no ear.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.320
You know about that, right?

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.820
I'm going to assume you have
some experience with Van Gogh.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.470
Anyway, okay, fine.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.400
So, the picture on the left is
original picture where I've

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.290
thrown away every sample.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.220
Maybe you can't tell.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.000
Picture in the middle I've thrown away.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.480
Every other sample, again,
both horizontally and vertically.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.760
The picture on the right,
I've done it again.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.890
Eve, I can tell, you probably
can't tell, I can tell it's,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.380
kind of, looking kind of crummy.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.560
And, in fact, if I blow up that
picture on the right, I see this.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.630
Okay?

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.160
And what you're seeing here, the, the
junk that's in here is caused by this,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.710
this aliasing, like just what we talked
about last time and, when I zoom it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.250
back up, you can see that you've brought
these high-frequencies in there and

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.160
there's all this stuff in here that
just doesn't seem like it's the blurry

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.340
version of what was in the original and
that's because it's not.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.240
It's an aliased example.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.190
So, how do we handle aliasing?

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.030
What we talked about this last time.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.730
What we have to do is we have
to filter and then sub sample.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.090
So what I've done now is I've taken a
small Gaussian smoothing in the original

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.110
sub sampled.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.120
Then smooth it again and sub sample.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.780
Then smooth it again and sub sample.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.570
And now when I blow it back up you'll
notice that the Gaussian sample then

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.060
that actually looks like a blurred
version of the thing on the left.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.560
Okay, and that's because I
haven't done any aliasing.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.620
So to do this multi-scale
stuff the right way,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.550
I have to sort of do this blurring and
subsampling.
