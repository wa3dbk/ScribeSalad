Well let's bring back our spreadsheet. Here we'll write equals c 2, which is

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:15.174
sigma divided by c 7, and we get 1.414. So that's the ratio between them and now

00:00:15.174 --> 00:00:20.890
what is this number? Do you recognize it? I wouldn't be suprised if you didn't,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.474
but this number is the square root of 2 and what was 2, 2 was our sample size.

00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:32.470
Is that not totally cool? I would pause this video now and think about this a

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.284
little bit, because it's definitely a very difficult conceptual idea.
