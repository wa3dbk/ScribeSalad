00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So just to recapitulate some of the stuff we talked about in this unit,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
ultimately, we talked about various different kinds of graphs,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
various different kinds of growth rates,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the whole notion of Big Theta and Big O notation

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to capture asymptotic growth rates

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and connecting these things up with various kinds of recurrence relations.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
There ended up being kind of a nice correspondence

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
between several different kinds of graphs,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
several different kinds of recurrence relations,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and several different growth rates.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
These growth rates are obviously important for

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
understanding how these graphs work,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but they are really important for algorithm analysis, as well,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and we're going to see algorithms with various run times

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that look like these as we proceed. See you next time.
