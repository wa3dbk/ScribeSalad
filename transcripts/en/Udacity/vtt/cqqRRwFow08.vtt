00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
For a given amount of money put in there is at most one possibility for the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.380
amount of candy that machine will dispense. This makes a lot of sense if you

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.325
think about real life and how machines like this would work. If you put a dollar

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:15.178
in the machine, a certain amount candy will come out. And the next time you put

00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:18.958
a dollar in, that same amount of candy will come out again since the price for

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.712
the candy is set. If this first choice with the case, then any given amount of

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:26.523
money could spit out a ton of different amounts of candy. It wouldn't be a very

00:00:26.523 --> 00:00:29.990
fair machine. And people would probably get really frustrated and not buy candy

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.713
from it anymore.
