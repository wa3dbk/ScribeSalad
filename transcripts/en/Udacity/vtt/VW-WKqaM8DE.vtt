00:00:00.103 --> 00:00:02.440
The second disadvantage is in construction,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.308
particularly contention in the construction process.

00:00:05.308 --> 00:00:07.416
What we might have is 2 different items,

00:00:07.416 --> 00:00:10.818
each of which wants to place 1 item into the hash table.

00:00:10.818 --> 00:00:13.149
Let's say both of these items decide

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.097
that they have the same hash function for their particular item,

00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:21.858
and so they both want to add an item to hash table bucket number 12, for instance.

00:00:21.858 --> 00:00:26.400
These 2 items want to simultaneously manipulate the link list in the same bucket.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.993
To do that, they're going to have to serialize and synchronize.

00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:31.436
Only 1 of them can update the bucket at any given time,

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:33.144
and the other must wait its turn.

00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:37.645
So any serialization like this within a parallel algorithm is definitely undesirable, as well.

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:39.765
So the conclusion here is that chaining

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:43.332
is a sub-optimal strategy if were dealing with parallel hash tables.

00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:46.000
So we're going to turn to a different method.
