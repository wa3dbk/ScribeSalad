00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For last year's weight, or the x axis, your mean estimate was 81.2.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm very flattered to report for this year on average after outlier removal

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you believe my weight went down.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The standard deviation for x was 10.6, and the same for y is 9.34.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Finally, I'll give you the mean of the following mixed product,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the difference from the original axis and the x bar, the mean,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
times the same for y.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This looks an awful lot like a variance, but it's between two different variables.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We call this a covariance or "cov" between two variables x and y.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In our example, the numerical value for the covariance is 75.36.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Using the covariance it is amazingly easy now to calculate the correlation r.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We just divide it by the two standard deviations for x and y.

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please give me that number.
