00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.190
Let's try and figure out one last pattern with our multiplication. We're going

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.480
to start by multiplying each pair of these binomials. Notice that the first term

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.488
is the same in each of the cases. Also notice that the second term is the same

00:00:12.488 --> 00:00:16.648
for each of the cases, except the signs are different, One's a plus, and one's a

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:20.861
minus. Use what you know about multiplying binomials to find the product of each

00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:21.389
of these.
