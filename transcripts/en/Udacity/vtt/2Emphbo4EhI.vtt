00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.089
Let's start by expanding out each of the
things that we have with an exponent. So,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:11.282
we know that 3^2 is just equal to 2 threes
multiplied together, so 3 times 3.

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:14.580
And we know that these two things are also
multiplied together, so we need a

00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:20.620
multiplication sign between these two
threes and these four threes. So, again,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.931
we just have a bunch of threes multiplied
together and, as we know, exponents are

00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:28.489
just a tool for writing repeated
multiplication of the same number in a

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.596
shorthand way. So our base is going to be
three since three is being multiplied over

00:00:32.608 --> 00:00:36.334
and over again, and we have six of them
multiplied together if you count them out.

00:00:36.334 --> 99:59:59.000
So the exponent is six. Remember, typed
in, you need to type 3^6.
