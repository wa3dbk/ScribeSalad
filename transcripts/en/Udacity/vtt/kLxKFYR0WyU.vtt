00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.490
The point of prototypes is to
be seen and interacted with.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.340
But who should be seeing them?

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.770
One of the most powerful concepts
in answering this question

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.370
is the idea of circles of feedback,
loosely defined there are four of them.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.270
First, you have the product team.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.600
As well as other people within
your company or social circle.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.020
These people are very easy to find and
interact with but

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.870
are too close to the project to give
accurate feedback as a customer.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.640
They're ideal for
low fidelity prototypes.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.080
Second, you have subject matter experts.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.020
These are people who know
something about the market in

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.610
which the product will be deployed.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.040
But are not working on
the product with you.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.350
They are also good for
low fidelity prototypes, and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.650
can give you decent insight into
medium fidelity prototypes.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.050
Third are your customers, these are
people who are in your target market,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.170
and who you can reasonably
expect to want your app.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.270
They give great feedback once
the prototype is of a fidelity they can

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.080
actually interact in a perfect for
medium and high fidelity prototypes.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.330
The last circle, only applies to
some apps, but is really vital for

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.580
those apps.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.930
These are your customer's customers.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.680
They're really important to get
feedback from and are perfect for

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.010
the same types of prototypes
as the customers are.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.220
Let's look at an example to
identify circles of feed back.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.780
Pretend for a moment that I
was just making a service for

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.390
college students to do their reading and
turn in their homework assignments.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.470
Now it's possible that I'm doing
this project on my own, but

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.534
even then it's likely that
I could find a friend or

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:30.370
co-worker who has gone
through the college process.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.550
That friend is someone I
could walk to the app and

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.330
it would be in this first
circle of feedback.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.140
The second circle would
be experts in the field.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.940
In this case, that would be college
professors, educational theorists or

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.430
UX designers.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.950
Third would be the college
administrators.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.990
Does the prototype fit their needs?

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.690
As people who would actually pay for
the app, they would be the customers.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.880
Finally, we'd want to show medium and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.210
high fidelity prototypes to
college students themselves.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.270
These students are out
customers' customers, and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.215
if they don't like the app
colleges will not buy it from us.

00:02:05.215 --> 00:02:09.875
So it's always important to test
with all four circles of feedback.

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:14.625
Again, this last circle only applies
to some apps, but is really vital for

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:15.355
those apps.
