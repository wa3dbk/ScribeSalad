00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.820
So far in this lesson, we've been working with equations involving exponents.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.270
So now let's look at the other side of the coin, equations involving Logs. Have

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.420
you ever had a hearing test? Or maybe you felt an earthquake or seen a

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.790
hurricane. All of these things are measured using logs. At the end of the

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.980
section, we use the properties that you've learned about logs and the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.570
techniques that we're going to discuss. To compare the intensity of two

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.460
different earthquakes. In the equations we're going to look at, the variable,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.575
which is oftentimes going to be x, will be part of the input to the log

00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:43.020
function. That means that to access is, we're going to need to use the inverse

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.520
of whatever log function we have, since that will undo what the log has done to

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.800
the x. So, what does that actually mean? Well, before, we were using each side

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.640
of our equation, as the input to a log function, because we had exponents. But

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.050
now, we're going to use each side as the input to the exponential function. So

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:13.040
let's actually do some work with this equation. Ln of x equals 10. What base do

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.260
you think will be best to use for our exponent, since of course, we want the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.286
inverse of the natural log?
