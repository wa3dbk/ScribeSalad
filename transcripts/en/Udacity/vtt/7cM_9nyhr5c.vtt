00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.910
So, essentially,

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.810
we're already saying that we need to
do something about cyber security.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.430
So how can that be done?

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.990
Making them go away is not
an easy thing obviously.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.010
One thing we can do is we can
make sure that crime doesn't pay.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.250
We're actually going to
talk about cyber laws.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.180
But making threats go away is nice idea,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.660
but it hasn't really
been all that effective.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.770
You can reduce vulnerabilities, but

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.150
we're never going to have
zero vulnerabilities.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.189
Complex systems, unfortunately,
always going to be error-prone, and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.170
some of those errors are going to be
vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.960
The three things that you always talk
about when you talk about securing or

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.220
protecting access to information,
is the data

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.709
sensitive in the sense that it can not
be disclosed to unauthorized parties.

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:51.850
Well that is really means
the data has what we call

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.090
a confidentiality requirement.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.180
You want to stop and prevent disclosure.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.620
It could be seen, but can only be seen
by those who are authorized to see it.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.410
Another requirement is
what's called integrity,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.200
that's really means that no one
should be able to corrupt it.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.490
So maybe not sensitive in the sense
nobody should be able to see it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.860
if they are not authorized, but
it could have integrity requirement.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.220
Only authorized people should be
able to write it or modify it.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.880
No one else should be able to change it,
and that is an integrity requirement.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.430
The third requirement we have for
data is what's called availability.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.470
The data is critical in the sense,
what we use it for is critical,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.598
so if the data goes away in order to
be able to do something that's really

00:01:33.598 --> 00:01:34.840
important to us.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.100
We can't access our online banking
services because the server has been

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.240
compromised, is down, or is a denial of
service attack, or something like that.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.628
So these are called the CIA,
Confidentiality, Integrity, and

00:01:48.628 --> 00:01:51.994
Availability requirements for
sensitive data.

00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:55.620
So here we're only talking about data
which is sort of the cyber side.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.950
We should say that cyber attacks could
also have physical consequences.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.580
So by successfully
attacking the computers,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.692
we will be able to cause harm for
their physical system.

00:02:07.692 --> 00:02:13.290
Most well-known case of this is
the Stuxnet malware that infiltrated

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.460
the Iranian nuclear plant network,
and destroyed centrifuges, and so on.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.385
So, that's an example where it's not
just this information disclosure, or

00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:23.277
corruption, but

00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:26.810
there's actually a physical
manifestation of a cyber attack.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.610
When we say what should we do?

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.180
Well, we need to protect data and
we need to protect systems.
