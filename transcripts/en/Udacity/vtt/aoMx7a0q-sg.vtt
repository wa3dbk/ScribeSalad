00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.430
Before we move on to creating
our own If statements,

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.200
let's look at a few examples.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.150
To see these examples in action,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.210
download the ifstatements.playground
file.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.700
To see your results in the console,
go up to the View menu,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.100
scroll down to Debug Area,
and click Show Debug Area.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.310
You might see three errors there
at the top of the console.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.400
Those are caused by
a bug in Playgrounds,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.965
which will hopefully be fixed soon,
but you can ignore them for now.

00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:29.130
Let's scroll down a little bit, and

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.830
first I want you to
focus here on Example 1.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.990
Now, when I go up to the Editors menu,
and

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.450
I click Execute Playground,
nothing happens.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.480
Now try changing the variable hungry
to true and see what happens.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.260
Down here, we can see nom nom
printed out in the console.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.430
Now let's focus on Example 2.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.380
This time try changing the value of
the Bool wantTeddyBear to be true and

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.290
see what happens, and down here in
the console, we can see snuggle snuggle.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.730
Moving on to Example 3,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.760
see what happens when you change
the variable raining to equal true.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.908
Again, you can see that a new message is
printed to the console, Ryan Gosling!

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:16.569
Be still my heart!

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.120
And notice that in each scenario
a different function is called.
