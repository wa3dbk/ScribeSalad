00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.616
Since we are doing algebra in this course
after all let's look at an expression that

00:00:04.628 --> 00:00:09.071
is similar to the last one we looked at
but actually has a variable it in. So here

00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:13.229
we have 4 - (x+9).
What do you think this is equal to? Please

00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:17.523
make sure to simplify your answer as much
as you can so I don't want to see any

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:21.196
parenthesis in here and I also want to see
all like terms combined.
