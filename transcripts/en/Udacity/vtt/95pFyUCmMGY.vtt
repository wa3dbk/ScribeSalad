00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.822
What if instead, we wanted a function identical to y equals 1 half to the x,

00:00:04.822 --> 00:00:11.100
but we wanted it to contain the point 3, 1? Remember that this function

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.381
contains the point 0, 1. Which function do you think fits this description? A

00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:21.439
hint again. Think about what transformation you would need to do to move the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.270
point 0, 1 to the point 3, 1. What substitution would you need to make in this

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.391
equation to perform that transformation?
