00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.800
Since this equation is linear, we can use our skills from before. We solve the

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.220
equation by grouping the variable terms on one side, and the constant terms on

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.600
the other. We subtract 4 from both sides first to get negative 3x equals

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.350
positive 3. Then we divide both sides by negative 3 to get x is equal to

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.352
negative 1. This is our answer, and for these types of problems we're going to

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:25.982
write the answer as a solution set. So this would be the solution set to our

00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:30.604
original equation. Once we find our solution, we want to make sure we always

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:35.590
check it against the excluded values. For this equation, we knew x cannot equal

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.660
0, so this solution set is okay, since x could equal negative 1. And like all of

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.549
our other equations, we can check to make sure that we're right. We plug in a

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:49.437
value of negative 1 for x here and here. When I simplify the equation, I'll have

00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:53.627
negative 3 and a half on the left and negative 3 and a half on the right. So

00:00:53.627 --> 00:00:55.337
yes, this is correct.
