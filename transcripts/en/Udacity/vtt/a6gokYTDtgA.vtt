Okay, so time for a quick quiz. What I'd like

00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:05.804
you to do is implement this function make_secure_val. This just takes

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:08.492
a string, which in this case is going to be our cookie

00:00:08.492 --> 00:00:11.884
body and returns that format we were describing before which is

00:00:11.884 --> 00:00:13.996
going to be S comma and then the hash of, of

00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:18.370
that string. And we're going to use this function, hash_str, which right

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.870
now is just using MD5. We're going to, I know I told

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.920
you MD5 is secure, so we are going to improve this,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.470
but for right now we're just going to use

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.370
MD5. So go ahead and implement this function. Good luck.
