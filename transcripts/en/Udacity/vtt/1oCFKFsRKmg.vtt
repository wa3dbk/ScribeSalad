00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.910
Gradle provides two ways
to visualize dependencies.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.050
A traditional dependency report showing
the complete graph of dependencies and

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.550
a dependency insight report showing how
a particular dependency is included

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.110
in your project.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.900
Here we have a simple Java project
with a single dependency on

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.930
the Spring Core Library.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.750
We can generate a dependency report
by running the dependencies task.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.810
Gradle displays
the project dependencies,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.160
including transitive dependencies.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.610
The report also breaks out
dependencies by each configuration.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.800
To see the dependencies for

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.900
a particular configuration, we can use
the --configuration command line option.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.710
And there we go we have the dependencies
just for the run time configuration.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.370
The dependency insight report shows how
a particular dependency is included in

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.340
our project.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.000
This report is especially helpful
when identifying version conflicts.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.720
To run the dependency insight task we
need to specify the dependency we're

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.710
interested in using the dash dash
dependency command line option.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.120
Let's get an insight report on
the commons-logging dependency.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.615
We can tell from this report that
commons-logging is a dependency of

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:07.520
spring-core, which in turn is a
dependency of our compile configuration.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.360
We mentioned that one of the main
uses of dependency reports

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.750
is to help identify
dependency version conflicts.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.580
Let's introduce a conflict and see how
this affects the output of our reports.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.435
Let's add an explicit
dependency on version 1.2

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:23.280
of the commons-logging library.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.805
If we now run the Gradle dependencies
task again, as you can see,

00:01:26.805 --> 00:01:30.550
commons-logging is now listed
twice in our dependency report.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.923
In this case,
you can see our project depends on 1.2,

00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:37.430
whereas spring-core depends on 1.1.3.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.280
This introduces a conflict, which
Gradle will then attempt to resolve.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.590
By default, Gradle resolves version
conflicts to the newest version,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.340
in this case 1.2.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.560
In our report this is
indicated by an arrow,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.130
showing us that version 1.2 is
being chosen over version 1.1.3.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.610
We can get similar information from
the dependency insight report.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.740
Let's run this report and
see the results.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.330
Again, we can see that the dependency
is shown twice in our report.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.530
We see that our compile configuration
depends on version 1.2, and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.930
that our compile configuration
also depends on spring core,

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.134
which depends on commons-logging 1.1.3.

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:15.620
Gradle noticed that there
was a version conflict, and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.904
resolved the conflict in
favor of version 1.2.
