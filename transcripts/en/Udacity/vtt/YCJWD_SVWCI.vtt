00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.107
Now that we have an expression for x, we are moving closer to simplifying and

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:08.217
finding a final solution. How many real roots do you think the equation will

00:00:08.217 --> 00:00:12.206
have? Try simplifying this expression we have x equal to, and see how many

00:00:12.206 --> 00:00:14.262
answers you know how to get from that.
