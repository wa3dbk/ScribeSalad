00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.477
Here's the filled in version of the table. You'll notice that we did end up with

00:00:04.477 --> 00:00:08.824
one spot in this far right column where we had to write undefined and that was

00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:13.310
where x equals 4. We set x equal to 4, the denominator here becomes 0. And since

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.666
we know that division is not allowed, it's not something we can interpret using

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:21.930
our algebra skills, you have to write undefined in this box. It makes the entire

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.441
fraction, the entire rational expression undefined. Whereas, when we were

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:29.121
dealing with quadratic inequalities, we were multiplying two factors together.

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:32.668
Now, we're dividing them. But what's interesting to note is that we have the

00:00:32.668 --> 00:00:36.323
same relationship between signs of the first two columns and the sign of the

00:00:36.323 --> 00:00:40.586
third column. If we're dividing two negative numbers, we get a positive number.

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:44.372
If we're dividing a negative by a positive or the reverse, a positive by a

00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:48.505
negative, we get a negative number. And if we're dividing two positive numbers,

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:52.417
we get a positive. Of course, zero is the exception, 0 divided by any number,

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:56.567
regardless of positive or negative, is 0. And any number, whether positive or

00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:59.863
negative divided by 0, is going to give us an undefined answer.
