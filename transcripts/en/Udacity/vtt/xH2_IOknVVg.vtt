00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.270
When you start building more
complicated user interactions,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.880
you'll come to rely on
animate with duration,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.140
a method used to specify the timing of
a change in the appearance of a view.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.220
Animate with duration
belongs to the class UI view.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.190
UI kits generic view class.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.320
You saw this method earlier
when we discussed extensions.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.570
As promised, I want to return to the
fate extension demo Xcode project, and

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.350
dissect the closure expression syntax.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.340
Open the View Controller.swift file and
take a look at the sunrise and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.580
set method.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.670
Focus on the completion parameter.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.390
Do you recognize the closure
expression syntax?

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.110
Here you can see that the method fadeout
takes in a closure expression as

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.310
a parameter,
the parameter named completion.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.660
And that closure expression takes
in a bool as a parameter, and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.870
returns void or nothing.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.910
The word, in, let's us know that
the body of the closure is coming up.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.720
In the body of the closure we find
the code that is intended to be executed

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.710
after the animation is complete.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.690
That's why this closure
expression is called completion.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.750
The body of the closure says.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.050
If the image is set to sunset,
change it to sunrise.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.210
If the image is set to sunrise,
change to sunset.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.190
This call to fade in is also
part of the completion closure.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.670
So what's going on here with
the completion parameter for fade in?

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.050
You might think we'd see another closure
expression here, but all we see is nil.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.240
That nil is standing in for
the closure expression.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.160
It's saying, this is what I want to
happen after the image fades in.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.100
I want nothing to happen.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.250
Now let's switch over to the UI
view extensions file for a second.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.470
I know I already pointed this out, but

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.705
I want to reiterate that this completion
parameter actually has an optional type.

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:43.725
You can see the type of
the closure expression here.

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:49.175
As we just saw, it takes in a bool and
returns void, but

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.025
then notice this question mark.

00:01:51.025 --> 00:01:54.955
That question mark makes it possible to
pass in nil as the completion parameter.
