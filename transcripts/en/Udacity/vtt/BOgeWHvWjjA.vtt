00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.180
Now that you have a better handle
on what polymorphism is and

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.700
how it helps us as programmers, don't
be surprised when you start noticing

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.450
examples of polymorphism everywhere,
in your code and in daily life.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.100
And, of course, your newfound mastery
of override will serve you well,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.530
especially to reduce
redundancy in your code.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.635
See you in the next session.
