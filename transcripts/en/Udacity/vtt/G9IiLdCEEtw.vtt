00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.676
Here's another error that many people make. Remember what our goal was? Our

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:09.675
goal was that our balance should be bigger than the target. So lots of people,

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:13.510
when they write their while loop, they put that goal, which they have firmly in

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.938
their mind, into the header of the loop. But that's not how the while loop

00:00:17.938 --> 00:00:22.150
works. The while loop says I want to stay in the loop while the condition is

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.997
fulfilled, and that's exactly the opposite of the goal. That's a common

00:00:26.997 --> 00:00:31.170
confusion. I'll let you fix it in just a minute, but here's how I remember it.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.860
Look at the board, little girl there. And she's warning, are we there yet? Have

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.395
I reached my goal, namely to be at the destination? And while loops are not

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:42.800
like little girls, they're the exact opposite. They're excited to be going and

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.700
going and going, so you want to formulate your goal while there's still work to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.409
be done, we can do it. You'll get a chance to fix this bug right now.
