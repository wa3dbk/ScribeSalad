00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.860
I grew up not seeing particularly well,
and I didn't know that I wasn't seeing

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.380
very well, but what I did know was
I wasn't doing well at school.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.060
I got my first pair of glasses and
suddenly the world changed and I could

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.310
start to see the board at school,
I started to do well in my exams.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.390
If my situation were different
this may have never happened.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.085
I wanted to make sure that that
wasn't the case for anyone else.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:25.430
Peak Vsion was owner of a challenge.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.040
People who can provide eye care tend
to live in cities and towns and

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.409
people who are blind tend to live in
very rural difficult to reach areas,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.140
particularly in low income
countries such as Kenya.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.840
And so the real vision was to try and
connect the two using mobile technology.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.968
Initially, we moved out to
Kenya to do some research,

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:44.150
which was setting up 100 clinics.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.542
I looked at all of the stuff that I was
having to cut around in this eye clinic,

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:49.665
which is over $150,000 worth of care.

00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:51.344
I thought can we try and

00:00:51.344 --> 00:00:57.325
transform this into a technology
that's really portable and accessible.

00:00:57.325 --> 00:01:00.895
So we went about redesigning every one
of the tests that were in the clinic

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:02.025
with either a small phone app or

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:05.865
piece of clip of hardware that
could sit on the small phone, and

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:09.665
allow it to be all performed on
a smart phone by a technician, so

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:14.260
without having to have expert healthcare
training using a configuration of

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.270
lenses and all sorts of complexities
that would make it possible to hold your

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.074
smart phone up, point it at someone's
eye, and get a view of the retina.

00:01:21.074 --> 00:01:23.950
So we have a suite of
Peak applications here,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.300
I'm going to show you the vision test.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.440
So what we do here is, it'll give us
some on-screen instructions to stand

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.780
two meters from the patient, and
they'll get a letter E to look at.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.300
They'll point in the direction of the E,
so this way it's going like that, so

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.310
we swipe on the phone accordingly.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.930
Now the advantage here is the tester
doesn't need to see what's going on on

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.290
the screen, so they're just going to
swipe whichever way the patient is

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.990
pointing, even if they're giving
the right or wrong answer.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.180
If they were to shake their head and

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.780
say they can't see, we can just shake
the device, now recorder not seen.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.305
And once the test is finished I get a
vibration alert and a reading on screen.

00:01:57.305 --> 00:02:01.630
And so what we can do is then view
their world based on our vision test

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.310
using our sight sim application,
which gives you the detected vision and

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.570
the normal vision, and it allows you
to walk around that person's visual

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.920
world and really understand
their level of sight impairment.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.370
The initial build of this were

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.070
designed to be used within the study
that I had moved to Kenya for,

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.910
but one of the big things that we learn
if you create a tool that's easy to use,

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.446
it's low cost and is intuitive,
it's likely to be adopted in any market.

00:02:28.446 --> 00:02:35.100
We often focus on impact in terms
of economics in the sense of,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.250
how can I make money, or how can
we take money out of this, whereas

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.460
there's a huge economic value in terms
of giving somebody their sight back.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.280
What we repeatedly saw in our clinics
in Kenya, is we'd have young children

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.870
supporting old parents or grandparents
who should've been in school.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.970
So for that child it means they're
like to never break out poverty.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.400
So moving the measure away from,
what can I take out of this,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.954
to what could I put in, is a real way of
actually assessing the economic impact.

00:03:02.954 --> 00:03:08.130
Then there's a huge number of areas
where mobile developers can add value.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.748
I think it's almost limitless in terms
of the way we could improve things.

00:03:11.748 --> 00:03:17.190
And by being able to contribute to
making other people's lives easier or

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.990
more efficient, you can then have
a huge knock-on effect on hundreds,

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.650
thousands, millions of other people.
