00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.238
After solving, we find that x is $10,000 and y is $15,000. Congrats if you got

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:08.486
both of these right. If you didn't, that's okay, too. Follow along with me in

00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:12.902
the solution, and then pause it when you find a mistake. Then continue solving,

00:00:12.902 --> 00:00:17.313
and see if you can get these answers. Remember, mistakes are okay. And this is

00:00:17.313 --> 00:00:22.032
the time that we learn from them. I'm going to rewrite this first equation by

00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:26.525
subtracting x from both sides to get y is equal to 25,000 minus x. I did this so

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:31.105
I could use substitution. I think that's the easier choice here. Now I perform

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:35.811
the substitution, then I can distribute my 8 hundredths to both terms. Here's my

00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:40.800
first term, 2,000, and my second term, negative 8 hundredths times x. I subtract

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.064
my constant term to move every constant to the right. And then that leaves me

00:00:46.064 --> 00:00:51.477
with x on the left. I combine my like terms, then I divide by the coefficient of

00:00:51.477 --> 00:00:56.713
x. I get x is equal to 10,000 or $10,000 which we invested at 7%. And remember

00:00:56.713 --> 00:01:01.939
this is a system of equations. And so we have two variables, x and y. Well we

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:07.217
know if x is $10,000, y must be $15,000, since those two have to add up to

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:12.819
$25,000. And as always, we can check our answers. By plugging in x and y into

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:16.090
both equations, we'll get true statements.
