00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.034
This question is something of a test of your vocabulary. Shading refers to per

00:00:04.034 --> 00:00:09.233
vertex versus per pixel. With Gouraud being per vertex and Phong being per

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:13.354
pixel. We're given the per pixel will be considerably more costly than per

00:00:13.354 --> 00:00:17.680
vertex. So this side of the grid will be more expensive. Illumination refers to

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.370
the Lambertian diffuse model versus the Blinn Phong specular model. Since the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.060
Blinn-Phong model builds on the Lambertian model, adding shininess, it must be

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.250
more costly. So the top part of this grid will be more expensive. These two

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.270
facts establish that Gourand and Lambert is the quickest and Phong shading with

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.152
Blinn-Phong illumination is the most expensive. The tie break between these

00:00:39.152 --> 00:00:42.716
other two combinations is that per pixel shading is given to be much more costly

00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:46.349
than vertex shading. This tips the balance so that Gouraud shading and

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:50.189
Blinn-Phong illumination is faster than Phong Shading and Lambertian

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:51.050
Illumination.
