00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We use this equation to describe the conduction of heat along the wire

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and over in a position to put some mathematical meaning to it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
As time goes on, the value of the temperature changes

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
by the length of the time step times this expression.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So this expression has to be the rate of change of the temperature with respect to time.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Ṫ₈ if you will at times 0.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Of course, we're always dealing with estimates here even though I'm writing an equal sign.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But now that we know about central-difference formulas,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we have another interpretation of the term.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's 1 mm squared delta x squared times the second derivative of our temperature.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Of course, I'm again cheating a little here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We only know the temperatures of the different compartments.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We don't have any curve of which we could form the second derivative.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, we're going to write this equation in a professional fashion. Let's do this right.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Temperature depends both on space and time.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It changes along the wire that is both position, and it changes with time. We see temporal evolution.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What we need here is the rate of change with respect to time and the way to be writing this is this.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's called the partial derivative of the temperature with respect to time.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's not written with lower case letter d but with curly type of d.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This derivative of the temperature with respect to time equals 10 over 1 second times 1 mm².

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And this one is the second partial derivative of temperature with respect to position written like this

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Note how this is being written.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The curly d is squared not the complete expression in the numerator.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Even though in the denominator, everything is being squared.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
They're going to discuss partial derivatives in the next segments so bare with me.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This equation is called the heat equation.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In this case, it describes the conduction of heat along the wire along one dimension,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and it's a partial differential equation.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
PDE is the technical term. It contains partial derivatives.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
That's why the differential equations we have seen so far are ordinary differential equations, ODEs.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
PDEs, partial differential equations, are typical for problems in space or problems in space and time.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The constant involved here is often called alpha the thermal diffusivity.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The name already hints at this being a diffuse equation.

00:02:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The heat diffuses along the wire.
