00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.950
Audio playback using
AVAudioEngine involves setting up

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.370
audio player notes with content.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.830
We will also be using
the AVAudioUnitTimePitch class

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.590
to make changes to the pitch
of the audio output.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.090
In order to make your audio
playback code a little easier,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.050
we've included the functions you
need in a class extension file that

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.680
you can import into pitch perfect.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.460
Class extensions allows us to add code
to the PlaySoundsViewController class,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.528
even though this code
resides in another file.

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:31.720
This is going to provide you with
a black box to play back the audio but

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.630
don't worry, you can see all
the code inside a black box.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.228
And I'll cover it, line by line,
a little later in this lesson.

00:00:37.228 --> 00:00:41.850
In the PlaySoundsViewController.swift
file add the following instance

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.230
variables enum after the IB outlets.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.500
Now, we can bring in
the class extension.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.440
It is a file called
PlaySoundsViewControllerPlusAudio.swift

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.100
and you can find it in the resources for
this lesson.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.070
I have it here on this folder and
I'll just drag it into Xcode.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.400
Make sure, Copy Item if needed,
is checked and

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.180
that the PitchPerfect
target is also checked.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.590
Click, Finish.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.280
I'm going to walk you through the code
you've just added line by line,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.800
a little later in this lesson.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.380
For now, we can concentrate
on just calling out to it and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.670
having the audio playback.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.477
First, we want to add a call to the
setup audio function in the viewDidLoad

00:01:16.477 --> 00:01:18.832
so that the AVAudioEngine
is properly setup.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.480
This is one of the functions that
is included in the extension

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.960
you've just added into Pitch Perfect.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.547
Add the line to call set up audio
here in the viewDidLoad function.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.612
Next, let's configure the UI, so

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:34.688
that the stop button is disabled
when this view first appears.

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:37.791
As the app won't be playing any
sound until the user presses

00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:40.140
one of the six playback buttons.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.010
In the extension file you just drag in,
there's a convenience function

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.900
to reset the buttons to the proper state
when playing or not playing music.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.230
We need to set them to not playing right
before the view first appears on screen.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.660
Now, what function can we use for that?

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.540
If you're thinking viewWillAppear,
you're right.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.192
Let's add the viewWillAppear function
to the PlaySoundsViewController.

00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:05.730
In viewWillAppear,
add a call to the configure UI function

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.000
telling it to set the buttons
to the not playing state.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.820
One step left before Pitch Perfect
can play back the audio and

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.780
that is what we're
going to be covering next.
