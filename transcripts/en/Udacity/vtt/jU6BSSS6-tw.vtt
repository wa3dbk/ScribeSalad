00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.960
So the Object.create technique seems to be the only that doesn't have

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.490
adverse side effects.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.830
Finally, we need to make the grab method available on all Van instances without

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.936
making that method available on any of the Car instances that are not Vans.

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:17.588
As usual, we will add the properties that we want to be available on

00:00:17.588 --> 00:00:21.829
all instances of a class to the prototype object that is stored as a property on

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:23.850
the constructor function.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.340
And it seems like we'd be all done,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.020
but there's one thing missing that belongs right here.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.330
Can you think of anything that we might of undermined, as a result of the fact

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.830
that we overrode the prototype object with a brand new object we created?

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.297
Looking at the diagram for a moment.

00:00:37.297 --> 00:00:41.646
Remember, that this object that we placed at the key.prototype on

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:47.240
our Van function, replaced an object that came for free with the Van function.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.130
So is there anything you can remember about the original object that was

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.670
special and important and might need to be put back?
