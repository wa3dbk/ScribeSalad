In the forecast fragment class, we modify the

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.134
onOptionsItemSelected method. When the Refresh menu item is selected,

00:00:08.134 --> 00:00:11.129
we create a new FetchWeatherTask and then we call

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.489
execute on it. While the call is no longer

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:16.487
blocking the UI thread because it's an AsyncTask, the

00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:19.390
app will still crash. If we check the logs,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.920
we see that the app crashed. This time though,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.030
with a security expression. It says Permission denied and

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.810
ask if you're missing the INTERNET permission or not. And indeed,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.670
we are missing the INTERNET permission, so we need to request it.
