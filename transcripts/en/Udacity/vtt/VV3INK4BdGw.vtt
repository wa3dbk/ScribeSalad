00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.510
So let's finally get to our earthquake problem. We're going to look at 2

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.930
earthquakes. One of them happened in Japan in 2011. This earthquake had a

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.030
magnitude of 9.0. The other earthquake we're going to talk about happened in

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.960
California. It was in 1857 and it had a magnitude of 7.9. This is the largest

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.620
known earthquake in California. Now what do these numbers actually mean? Well,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.143
let's talk about the equation for the magnitude of an earthquake. let's say that

00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:36.750
R is the magnitude of an earthquake on a Richter scale. Then for R we have the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.945
equation R equals log base 10 of I over S. Here, I is the intensity of the

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:49.600
earthquake and S is equal to some constant. It's supposed to be the intensity

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.340
of some sort of standard earthquake, which just has a fixed value. We don't

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.650
need to know this value though, since we'll be eliminating it from our

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.134
equations eventually. So here, once again, is our information about our two

00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:06.890
earthquakes. How does this information fall into an equation of this sort?

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.310
Well, we know that R is the magnitude. So that means that over here for Japan

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.210
we'll have 9.0 equals log base 10 of J over S. I'm just going to use the letter

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.625
J instead of I, to show that this in the intensity of the Japanese earthquake.

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:30.100
For California, we'll have something very similar. We're just going to instead

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.870
have and R value of 7.9 and I'll use the letter C to represent the intensity of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.840
this quake, C for California. Now notice that in both of these log equations,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.540
we have a fraction as the input to the log. What we're going to want to do

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.600
first is to split each of these up into two separate logs, since otherwise

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.310
you're not going to be able to get rid of the S. So, which property do we need

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.080
to use in order to do that? Should we use the product property, the quotient

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.395
property, the power property or the change of base property.
