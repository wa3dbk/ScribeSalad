00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.019
Now we are going to talk about how
actually Access Control is implemented

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.850
in real operating systems.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.330
We actually going to talk
about Unix-like systems, but

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.730
there is similar things done
in other operating systems.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.450
Let's focus on Unix-like systems.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.230
And so we have to think about users,
resources, access permissions and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.230
things like that for

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.520
us to understand how access
controlled is handled by this system.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.570
So in Unix, actually every resource for

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.520
which access needs to be
controlled looks like a file.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.220
So in your next like system we
also know that users have UID.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.170
Unique identifiers for
the users that we have in the system.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.960
Users can also be groups and certain
users could be members of a group.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.030
There is a special group.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.790
Every user in system
that's the world group.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.160
And we look at access control for
a file, we're going to say,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.710
well, who is the owner?

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.500
What kind of access does the owner have?

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.840
Is there some group that
access to this file?

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.180
What kind of access that is,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.710
and what about everybody, people who
are not owner or members of this group?

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.550
Since resources of files,
they can be read, written or

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.320
executed, these
are the three access rights.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.210
So at this point, we know, we think
about your access control matrix

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.000
instruction, rows would
correspond to each UID and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.660
each group ID that we have, GID and
a special group world that we have.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.810
Column is going to correspond to each
file that we have in the system and

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.740
if you look at an entry in
the access control matrix

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.830
it's going to be a subset
of read write execute.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.270
Unix system, the original ACL
implementation was actually,

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.660
had a compact fixed size implementation.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.550
Remember, ACLs are ACEs,
so that's for each user,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.620
so the owner is one of the users,
then the group would be the next one,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.220
and then everybody is this special
world group that we are talking about.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.030
So actually had only three
maximum of three ACEs.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.820
Actually had three possible ACEs and ACL
it wasn't implemented as a link list.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.840
It wasn't implemented.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.305
It was implemented as a bit mask.

00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:10.905
In particular, we need nine bits.

00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:14.955
So the nine bits encoded read,
write, execute for owner.

00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:17.445
Let's say the bit is on for
read for a given write,

00:02:17.445 --> 00:02:19.025
then the user has that write.

00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:20.780
So the user can read it.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.920
This is how the compact
fixed sized representation,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.690
perhaps in those days seven
memory was important, so

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.150
they implemented ACLs using
this essentially nine bits.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.240
Little bit more complicated,
but that's the main idea.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.620
A few things,
few extra bits we'll talk about.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.100
Now this does have its limitations,
for example, you can only have three

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.620
subjects or principle whom access
can be either just the owner or

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.020
just one group or everybody.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.210
If we had 10 different users,
you want to get information to six or

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.760
three or whatever it is,
we can't have an arbitrary size

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.150
access control list with this
representation we had here.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.220
So operating systems actually now
provide implementations of full ACLs,

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.450
and it's available in many operating
systems, Linux, MacOS, BSD, and so on.
