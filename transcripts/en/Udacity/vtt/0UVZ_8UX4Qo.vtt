00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.770
The method would look like river.replace and the first argument would be i and

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.900
the second one would be x, the return value would be Mxssxssxppx. Let's look at

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.060
the javadoc to see why. To find the javadoc for the string class we'll search,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.370
and I'm just doing this in Google. So, I'm in the documentation for the string

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:27.595
class. You want to scroll down and look for the Method Summaries. Under the

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:33.338
method summaries, there are a couple of different options for replace. Let's

00:00:33.338 --> 00:00:38.463
look at this one. It has a detailed description here, it takes a target and

00:00:38.463 --> 00:00:43.500
replacement. The target is the things that we want to replace, and the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.250
replacement is what we should replace them with. So in our case, the target

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.810
would be i in quotation marks, and the replacement would be x in quotation

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.240
marks. We can demo how this works in BlueJ. On the river string, I call replace

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:04.480
and I replace i with x. [SOUND], and we got what we expected.
