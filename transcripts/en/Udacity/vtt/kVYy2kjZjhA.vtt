00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The basic next question is is there a way to void the overshoot?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It would be nice if we could do this, because driving in an oscillating car is no fun.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In fact, it makes you really seasick, believe me.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I've been in this car for months on end when we prepared for the Darpa Grand Challenge.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The trick is called "PD-control."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In PD-control my steering alpha is no just related to the crosstrack error by virtue

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
by virtue of the gain parameter tau p,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but also to the temporal derivative of the crosstrack error.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What this means is that when the car has turned enough to reduce the crosstrack error,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
it won't just go shooting for the x axis,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but it will notice that it's already reducing the error.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The error is becoming smaller over time. It counter steers. It steers up again.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This will allow it to gracefully approach our target trajectory,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
assuming appropriate settings of our differential gain--tau d versus the proportional gain tau p.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
How do you compute this derivative over here?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Well, at time t this is the same as the crosstrack error at time t minus the crosstrack error

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
at time t minus 1 divided by the time span between t and t minus 1.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In our code, we assume delta t equals 1, so so we can omit this.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The difference of the current crosscheck error and the previous one is this term over here.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We now control not just in proportion to the error itself but also to this difference

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
of the error using a second constant tau d.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Let's implement this. Now I give the run command two parameters--param1 and param2.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I want you to implement a controller that varies the steering direction proportionally

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
according to parameter 1, and differentially proportionally to parameter 2.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Again, run for 100 time steps and see what happens.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
When I run my new controller with proportionality parameter of 0.2

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and the differentiation one is 3.0.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Then, I get a sequence of y values that converge much more gently to 0.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Miraculously, as time goes on, they really go down to 0 and stay at 0,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
which we didn't achieve for the proportional controller.

00:02:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please write that routine so we can test it.
