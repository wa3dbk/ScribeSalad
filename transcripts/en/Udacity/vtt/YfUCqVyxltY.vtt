Physicians are busy.

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:10.150
Their work depends on data taken from a

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.740
They have little,
if any training in informatics.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.730
EMRs could be better.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.280
Isn't it possible to innovate and
offer approaches to the computer

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.395
physician interface that are more
imaginative and hopefully more

00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:28.280
successful than mimicking the paper
tools that have been used for decades?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.280
We turn to that now.
