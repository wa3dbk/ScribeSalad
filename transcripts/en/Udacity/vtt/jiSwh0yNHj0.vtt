00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's my solution:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So, I have my state--I just broke it up into pieces so that I know what I'm talking about.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Then if I hold it becomes the other player's turn.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The other player's score is the same as it was before.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So now remember the second place is the score of the player whose turn it is.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, that was you previously, and then the score that I got--I just add in the pending.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I reap all of those, and the pending gets reset to zero.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
When I roll, again let's figure out what's in the state,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
if the roll is one that's a pig out,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
it becomes the other player's turn, and I only got one lousy point.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Pending gets reset to zero.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If the role is not a one then it's still my turn.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I don't change my score so far, but I add d onto the pending.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Here's just a way to map from one player to the other.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If the other player, if it was one it becomes zero.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If it was zero it becomes one.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's always a great idea to write some test cases.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now, one comment on style.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Right here I'm taking this state, which is a tuple that has four components,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and I'm breaking it up like this into it's four components.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
When you have four components that's probably okay,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but it's getting to worry me a little bit that maybe I won't be able to remember

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which part of the state is which.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If I had more than four, if I had five or six components,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I really start to worry about that.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So there are other possibilities where we can be more explicit about what the state is

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
rather than just have it be a set of undifferentiated elements of a tuple

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that we then define like this.

00:01:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We can define it ahead of time.
