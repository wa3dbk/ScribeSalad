00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.770
&gt;&gt; So it looks like the entire goal of that chunking process was to help us

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.400
figure out between these two operators which one we should actually select.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.080
We decided that, if a fast ball is suggested, which it was, and

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.220
if two operators are suggested, which they were, and the batter is Parra,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.250
which it is, then to dismiss the throw-fast-ball operator. That means we only

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.710
have one more operator suggested, throw-curve-ball. So that would be selected.
