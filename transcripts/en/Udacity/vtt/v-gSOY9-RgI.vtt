00:00:00.312 --> 00:00:04.372
Let's talk about ways to minimize time spent on memory accesses.

00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:09.993
The first strategy to think about is move frequently accessed data to fast memory.

00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:13.517
We've talked about the memory spaces available to the GPU.

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:19.019
There's local memory, which represents a given thread's private variables, local variables,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.957
parameters, things like that.

00:00:20.957 --> 00:00:22.655
There's shared memory, shared by a thread block.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:24.988
There's global memory shared by all the threads.

00:00:24.988 --> 00:00:31.096
And more or less, it's true to say that local memory is faster than shared memory,

00:00:31.096 --> 00:00:33.432
which in turn is faster than global memory.

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:38.043
In fact, shared memory and local memory are usually much faster than global memory.

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:40.280
I should mention that there are subtleties here.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.174
For those of you who know something about computer organization,

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:46.979
the reason why I'm labeling local memory as so fast is that it tends to live

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:53.753
either in registers or in l1 cache, and those are both quite fast.

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:56.027
This isn't a hard and fast rule. There's some subtleties here.

00:00:56.027 --> 00:01:00.977
But in general data that is kept local to a thread is going to be about as fast as possible.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:07.230
Data that is shared in a thread's thread block shared memory is going to be very fast,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.843
and data that is way out in global memory is going to be a lot slower,

00:01:11.843 --> 00:01:17.243
although this is still much faster then CPU memory, also known as host memory.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:21.577
Let's see an example of using local, shared, and global memory.

00:01:21.577 --> 00:01:23.149
Here's a kernel.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.182
I know that it's a kernel because it starts with either device or global.

00:01:27.182 --> 00:01:32.149
It's called use local memory GPU, it has one parameter called in,

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.025
and it's got one local variable called f.

00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:39.465
Because this is a local variable it's in local memory it's private to this thread,

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:42.300
every thread will have its own copy of a variable named f.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.451
And parameters are also local memory.

00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:48.375
Every thread will have it's own copy of a parameter called in.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:52.345
You know real code would presumably do something with these variables.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.980
But since this is just an example of how to use local memory,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.989
I don't need to do that.

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:58.785
How would you call a kernel that shows using local memory?

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.220
Well, you would call a kernel,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.863
you would have to launch it, meaning tell the GPU how many thread blocks to run with how many threads.

00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:11.797
You pass in any parameters. So in this case, 2.0. Pretty simple.
