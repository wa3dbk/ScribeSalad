00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.370
The main concept of HTTP is that
clients tell servers what they

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.650
want by using an HTTP verb,
also know as an HTTP method.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.970
There are nine HTTP verbs in
the current HTTP specification.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.340
The two most commonly used methods for
websites though, are GET and POST.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.290
A GET request can be thought of
as the client telling the server,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.260
get me some information that you have.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.580
Or, a POST can be thought
of as the client saying,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.160
I want to modify some
information that you have.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.590
GETs are sometimes called safe methods,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.795
since they are only used to retrieve
existing data from the database,

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:37.720
whereas POSTs call for data to be added,
removed, or changed on a server.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.050
We know that the client prefixes
requests to the server with HTTP verbs.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.730
So, how does the server reply?

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.650
Status codes are the server's
reply to a client as to

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.910
what happened after a specific request.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.550
In addition to a status code,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.380
a server can also supply any requested
resources the client requested,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.270
such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and
media files such as images and audio.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.420
Some common response codes are 200,
which indicates a successful GET

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.430
request, 301, which is a successful
post request, and 404, which indicates

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.170
that we were looking for a file on the
server, and the server couldn't find it.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.100
In the next section, we'll put all
of these concepts together as we

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.710
create our own web server in Python.
