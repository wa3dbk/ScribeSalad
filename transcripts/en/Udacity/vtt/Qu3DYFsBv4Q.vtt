00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.640
So we've worked with notifications and
more recently with widgets.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.000
Both are good examples of API's
provided by the Android system

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.370
that let your app extend beyond the full
screen activity we started with.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.790
However, this isn't limited
to just the system.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.220
Apps can also provide API's you
can integrate into your app to

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.380
further extend your app.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.110
A little research shows that this is
exactly how Muzei does its magic.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.080
It extends the live wallpaper
API provided by Android.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.253
Gives us an easy API where we only worry
about sending Muzei new wallpapers.

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:40.750
And it does all the work actually
displaying them to the user,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.720
controlling things like how bright or
blurred the picture should be,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.301
fixing those issues with readability,
we mentioned before.

00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:52.710
And even mirroring the wallpaper over to
Android Wear devices if the user wants.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.010
So how do we do it?

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.500
First, we'll add a gradle dependency.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.940
Then a manifest entry for
our MuzeiArtSource.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.410
MuzeiArtSource is an intent service,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.010
which Muzei will connect
to get our wallpapers.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.200
The intent filter is how Muzei knows
it can connect to our service.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.430
We'll also include a special icon,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.990
description and even a color to
help make sunshine feel at home.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.890
So what happens when a user selects
our app for their wallpapers.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.100
First, we get a call back in our
Muzei Art Source of on Enabled.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.610
Then on Subscriber Added.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.350
Then comes the most important one,
on Update.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.200
This is where we will publish our
wallpaper making it available to Muzei.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.993
Similarly, upon selecting
a different app,

00:01:36.993 --> 00:01:41.880
we'll get an on Subscriber Removed,
and on Disabled callback.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.570
So what would our on Update look like?

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.635
We'll do a simple query to
get the current weather.

00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:52.105
Use a new Utility method
getImageURLForWeatherCondition

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:57.565
to get the appropriate wallpaper URL and
then build up an Artwork object.

00:01:57.565 --> 00:02:00.375
In our case we'll include the imageUrl.

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:03.825
We'll use a description of the weather
as the title or main piece of content.

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:07.960
And then we'll use
the locationQuery as the byline.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.590
Our secondary line of text.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.720
Muzei offers the ability
to open more details.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.590
Loading the main activity of
sunshine seems like a good way of

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.920
seeing more details to me.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.410
We'll pass that artwork
through to publishArtwork.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.880
Like magic, we'll see Muzei
handle all the image loading,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.000
live wallpaper code and other work to
get our imagery on the user's wallpaper.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.020
Neat.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.570
While we have the option of using
Muzei's scheduleUpdate method,

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.890
we can use the same
approach as our Widget, and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.790
use our data changed action
to trigger an update.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.100
That way, whenever the data changes,
we'll update the wallpaper as well.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.580
In this case, though,
we're triggering a service.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.658
So we'll add a start service call,
to our sync adapter.

00:02:50.658 --> 00:02:54.550
Then, our onHandleIntent,
can include a special check for

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.490
the data updated action.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.380
And if we're enabled, and
the user who has selected us as their

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.260
background source,
we can call our own update method.
