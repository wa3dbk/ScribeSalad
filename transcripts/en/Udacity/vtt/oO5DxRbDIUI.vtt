00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.560
You enter a space of wonder and mystery.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.470
Space where code writes itself,
space where programs act independently.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.000
Where the mystic and efficiency collide.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.994
You are now ready for meta-programming.

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:18.141
[MUSIC]

00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:20.200
Diego, are you okay?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.800
&gt;&gt; Hi Julia.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.180
Yeah, I'm doing quite well.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.900
I'm just talking about meta-programming.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.530
&gt;&gt; But meta-programming isn't magical,
it's just a little tricky.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.995
Also, why are we in black and white.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.163
[SOUND] That's better.

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:32.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know what Julia?

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.820
You're right.
Meta-programming

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.480
is something that you've
likely seen in action before.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.620
It's the process of writing
code that writes more code.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.750
And it's more common
than you would expect.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.650
&gt;&gt; In the following lesson you're
going to learn about the ways that Ruby

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.570
uses Meta-programming to
make coding easier for you.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.170
&gt;&gt; You'll also learn how to take
advantage of Ruby Meta-programming

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.620
features to solidify your
understanding of the Ruby language and

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.220
to help make your code more dry.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.800
&gt;&gt; Let's get started
