00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.287
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Instead of choosing those two points, I'm going to choose two other points.

00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:08.640
We can see that to go from this point to the second point, we need to rise three

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.038
units up and run six units to the right. Because we went up vertically three

00:00:13.038 --> 00:00:17.508
units, we know that this is a positive 3. And since we traveled six units to the

00:00:17.508 --> 00:00:22.270
right, we know that the run is really positive 6 in the positive direction. When

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.558
we find the slope, or the m, we're really finding the ratio of the rise divided

00:00:26.558 --> 00:00:31.320
by the run. We already know that 3 6ths is really the same thing as 1 half. This

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.691
is great, we got the same slope as from before. We can see that the slope of 3

00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:40.227
6ths is the same thing as 1 half. It always puts us on our line. But remember we

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:44.457
can also read slope in other directions. I don't have to start from this point

00:00:44.457 --> 00:00:49.164
and go to this point, I could go in the reverse direction. If I started from

00:00:49.164 --> 00:00:53.868
this point, 6, 6. I would travel down three units, and then left six units. So

00:00:53.868 --> 00:00:58.982
here, the vertical distance is really a drop. It's a 3 unit distance down. So

00:00:58.982 --> 00:01:03.926
the rise would be negative 3. We move three units down in a negative direction.

00:01:03.926 --> 00:01:08.964
And 6 units left in a negative direction. Since both of these directions are

00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:14.312
negative, we know the rise is really negative 3. And the run is really negative

00:01:14.312 --> 00:01:19.148
6. A negative divided by a negative makes a positive so we are left with 3 6ths,

00:01:19.148 --> 00:01:23.889
or 1 half. That's pretty cool. Any way we try and find the slope, we always get

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:28.776
the same ratio. We just need to be careful about our directions and our negative

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:29.257
signs.
