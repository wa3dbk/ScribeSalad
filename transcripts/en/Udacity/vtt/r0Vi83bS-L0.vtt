00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.090
An invariant is a statement of a property that's always true.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.460
You can think of it as an expression of a key system requirement.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.020
Might be an essential relationship among the values of objects in,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.650
in your system. The keyword that's used to indicate that, you know,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.620
you're expressing an invariant constraint is inv. For example,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.340
you might say in large companies that the official definition of

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.800
a large company is a company that has more than 50 employees.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.270
And you could express a constraint that says that in OCL by having in

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.920
the context of the large company class. An invariant that

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.139
says its number of employee's attribute must be greater than 50.
