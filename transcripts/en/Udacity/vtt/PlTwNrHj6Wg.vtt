00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.775
All right, you're done.

00:00:01.926 --> 00:00:05.039
I hope you don't mind that I gave you
the larger table this time.

00:00:05.123 --> 00:00:06.533
But it depends on the first one,

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.945
so it would've been hard to give you
in any other order.

00:00:09.306 --> 00:00:11.317
I gave you the content value structure,

00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:13.679
so it's pretty easy 
to just insert the data.

00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:15.937
Then, we query the data back out.

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:20.986
If move to first fails, the cursor is empty,
and the query failed.

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:22.914
Lots of cut and paste here.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.091
It is nice to fetch the db values 
using the Helper for the data type,

00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:29.037
although its not strictly necessary,

00:00:29.037 --> 00:00:32.606
since we know our test data is actually
going to match our constraints.

00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:35.029
There is one more failure case 
we need to add here,

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:37.930
if our query doesn't return any rows.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.003
And that's it.

00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:42.707
All that just to get a database
and a way to test it.

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:45.306
Now let's run the test again.

00:00:45.383 --> 00:00:48.633
Well, at least we know 
all the basic stuff works,

00:00:49.207 --> 00:00:51.919
and just remember, without these tests,
you wouldn't have been able

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:54.705
to run this code 
for a very, very long time.
