00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.910
Let's look at the solution to our multi-predictor quiz where we

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.090
have a program for which the two bit predictor works for many instructions.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.840
PSHARE covers some additional instructions and

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.110
GSHARE covers the rest that PSHARE doesn't cover. But all of

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.880
them can correctly predict the same branches that the two-bit predictor can.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.190
So, because the two-bit predictor covers the most branches, and

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.030
it's the cheapest predictor, what we want to do is use the two-bit predictor for

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.760
most of the branches. So the correct answer here is E, Hierarchical predictor,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.160
that chooses between a two bit predictor and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.660
a predictor that combines the PSHARE and GSHARE. So,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.390
what this first part does is it basically makes most of the branches just go

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.080
to the two bit predictor so that the space in the more expansive predictor here.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.580
Will be reserved for only the branches that actually need to go there,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.415
because the 2 bit predictor is not predicting them correctly. Because PSHARE and

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:12.730
GSHARE have different strengths and neither of them is clearly superior

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.380
to the other, we are not going to combine them using a hierarchy co-predictor,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.470
we are going to combine them using a tournament predictor.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.120
That will choose between PSHARE and GSHARE. So,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.680
the correct answer is that the overall predictor is a hierarchical predictor

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.760
that chooses between a two bit predictor and a tournament predictor

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.230
which itself chooses between PSHARE and GSHARE or the other way around.
