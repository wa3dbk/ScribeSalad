00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.510
Let's create a weather provider class within the

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.236
data package. We'll have it extend content provider. [SOUND]

00:00:06.236 --> 00:00:08.942
You can have the required method by heading

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:13.309
Ctrl+I once more. Content providers implement functionality based upon

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.676
the URI's. Each URI type is tied to

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:20.220
an integer constant. Our content provider will implement five

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.280
different types of URI's. Each one of these

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.750
URI's will be used for different types of queries.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.840
For now, let's just add these constants into our weather provider class.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.010
Android provides a URI matcher class to help

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.850
match URI's to our integer constants. It provides

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.640
for an expression syntax to match various URI's.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.020
Now these are just examples. You're going to have

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.840
to implement one of these very soon. Note,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.630
that there are two wildcards. The pound sign

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.710
is used to match a number, while a star is used to match a string. Using this,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.110
you can very, very easily match any of the URI's

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.570
that we would want to pass in to our content provider.
