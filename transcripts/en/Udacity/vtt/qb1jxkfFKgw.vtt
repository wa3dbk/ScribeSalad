00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.831
In order to get rid of the term negative 2 3rd x on the right side of the

00:00:03.843 --> 00:00:08.360
equation, we need to, as always, do the opposite. Since 2 3rd x is being

00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:13.274
subtracted right now, we need instead to add it. This is going to leave us on

00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:17.487
the right side with just 4, since negative 2 3rd x plus positive 2 3rd x equals

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:22.952
0. So nothing is being added or subtracted from 4 anymore. Over on the left

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:27.867
side, we now have x plus 2 plus 2 3rd x. If you'd have decided to take this one

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:33.053
step further and combine these two like terms, the ones with the x to the 1st in

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:37.943
them, you'd end up with 5 3rd x plus 2 equals 4. Just for future reference, I

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:43.053
personally prefer to write fractions in their improper form instead of mixed

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:47.660
sometimes. Just because that makes more sense in my head. Instead of 5 3rds, you

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:51.805
also of course could have 1 and 2 3rds x. This is just my personal preference.
