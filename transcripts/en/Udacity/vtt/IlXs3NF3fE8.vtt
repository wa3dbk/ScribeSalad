00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.500
So now having seen the sequential memory consistency model, what we can do is go

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.160
back to our original example, and ask the

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.460
question, what are all the possible outcomes for

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.079
this particular set of memory accesses performed on

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.050
p1 and p2? Now what possible values can

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.120
d and c get? Well obviously, you can get the first choice, no problem with that.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.820
Can get the second choice, it can get

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.740
the third choice, and as we illustrated earlier,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.360
all of these are just interleaving of these

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.860
memory accesses on P1 and P2. But the fourth

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.470
one Is not possible with sequential consistency, because

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.030
there's no interleaving of these memory axes and these

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.370
memory axes that'll result in this particular outcome.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.440
That's comforting, that's exactly what we thought would be

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.335
a useful thing to have in a

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:57.210
memory-consistency model that gives only intuitive results and,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.140
and makes sure that non-intuitive results don't happen.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.936
Memory consistency model is what the application programmer

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:06.126
needs to be aware of, to develop his

00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:08.827
code and know that it will execute correctly

00:01:08.827 --> 00:01:12.430
on the shared memory machine. As operating system

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.480
designers, however, we need to help make sure

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.510
that this code runs quickly. To do that,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.260
we need to understand how to implement the model

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.140
efficiently. And also the relationship between hardware and software

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.080
that makes it possible to achieve this goal. So

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.360
now, we understand the memory consistency model. What

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.800
is the model that is presented to the programmer?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.960
That's what memory consistency model is. On the other

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.200
hand, cache coherence is how is the system implementing

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.820
the model in the presence of private

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.150
caches? So this is a handshake, a partnership

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.110
between hardware and software, between the application

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.660
programmer and the system, in order to make

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.730
sure that the consistency model is actually

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.390
implemented correctly by the cache coherence mechanism that

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.450
is ingrained in the system. And the system

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.250
implementation of cache coherence. Is itself a hardware-software

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.550
trade off. Now for instance one possibility, is

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.810
that the hardware is only giving shared address

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.980
space. It's not giving you any way of

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.670
making sure that the caches are coherent, but it

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.030
is giving you the shared address space. And

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.710
it is letting the software, the system software

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.640
ensure that this contract is somewhat satisfied. And

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.340
the working of the cache coherence maintained in software

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.610
by the system. That's one possibility, and that is what is called a non-cache

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.550
coherent shared address multiprocessor. Meaning that There

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.250
is shared address space, that's available for all

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.250
the processors, there is private caches for holding data that you bring from

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:56.390
memory, but, if you modify data, it is a problem of the system software to make

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.270
sure that the caches remain coherent. So it's non-cache coherent. That is called

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.100
NCC shared memory multi-processor. The other possibility

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.020
of course is that, the hardware does

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.730
everything. It provides the shared address space,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.850
but it also maintains cache coherence in

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.350
hardware. And that's what is called a

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.723
cache coherent multi-processor, or a CC multi-processor.
