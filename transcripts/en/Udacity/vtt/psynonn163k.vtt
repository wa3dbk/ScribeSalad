00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The correct answer is we'll see an Error 405.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We never added a post() handler for /, and so our application will complain.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's go ahead and see that in real life.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Okay, here we are in our browser with the text that I entered,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and I clicked submit.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
405--The method POST is not allowed for this resource.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.730
That means we never wrote the POST function for /.
