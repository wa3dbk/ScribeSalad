00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.740
Here are the solutions. Great work if you got most of these right. For these

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.646
two parabolas, we know that they're going to open up or down, since they're in

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:14.315
the form y equals. We look at these numbers or the a value to determine whether

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:19.956
or not they open up, or whether or not they open down. Since the a value is

00:00:19.956 --> 00:00:25.747
negative here, we know that this parabola must open down. And since the a value

00:00:25.747 --> 00:00:31.408
is positive here, we know that this parabola opens up. To find the vertex of

00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:36.870
this parabola, we simply look at the h and k value. h would be positive 4, by

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.443
setting this binomial equal to zero. And k would be positive 2. The number

00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:48.634
added on the end. For this parabola, the vertex is 1,3. Again, we set the

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:53.903
binomial equal to zero. So that way, we get an x coordinate of x equals 1. The

00:00:53.903 --> 00:00:57.814
y coordinate of the vertex is the k value, or just positive 3. These two

00:00:57.814 --> 00:01:03.858
parabolas here open left or right, since they're of the form x equals. By

00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:07.516
looking at the a value, we can see that one of them is negative, and the other

00:01:07.516 --> 00:01:13.565
one is a positive 1. This means that the negative 1 must open to the left and

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:18.978
that the positive 1 must open to the right. Remember, negative a values for x

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:23.065
equals parabolas make the parabola open to the left, whereas positive values of

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:28.806
a for x equal parabolas make the parabola open to the right. And finally, to

00:01:28.806 --> 00:01:32.649
find the vertex for this parabola, we look at the value of h here and the value

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.928
of k here. H is simply positive 2, our x coordinate of the vertex. And our y

00:01:38.928 --> 00:01:44.965
coordinate of the vertex is positive 1. We set this binomial equal to 0, to get

00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:50.996
y equals 1. And we find this vertex in a similar way. Here's the h value for

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:57.204
our vertex. The x coordinate is positive 2. And here's the y value for our

00:01:57.204 --> 00:02:02.001
vertex, its negative 3. Remember we set the binomial y plus 3 equal to 0 and

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:05.300
solve for the y coordinate of this vertex.
