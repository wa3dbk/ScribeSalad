00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.737
Let's discuss the answer to our disks and tape

00:00:02.737 --> 00:00:07.969
quiz. Tape can only efficiently support sequential axises. We

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:10.381
are reading a large file from start to end,

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:12.726
which is a sequential axis so it's okay to

00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:16.660
use tape. However, the disk will not do too

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.307
bad on that either. If, however, we want to

00:00:20.307 --> 00:00:22.617
read just the first and last byte of a

00:00:22.617 --> 00:00:25.543
large file for tape we pretty much have to fast

00:00:25.543 --> 00:00:28.954
forward through the entire file on tape. So tape

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:31.642
is not going to do too well, whereas on

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:34.330
disk we will seek to where the first and

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.850
then where the last byte is and just read it.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.180
So disk will still work reasonably well here because

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.310
the disk is a so-called random access medium meaning

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.210
we give it an address and it kind of goes

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.620
there. With a tape, it takes a lot longer to

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.490
get to any single position because we need to really go past all the other

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.720
positions. And finally, a cat would much rather play with a reel of tape

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.858
than with a hard drive and there are thousands of YouTube videos that prove

00:01:07.858 --> 00:01:11.785
this point. Cats like stringy things much

00:01:11.785 --> 00:01:15.926
more than disky things, especially if the disky

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:20.290
things are enclosed in a metal, rectangular box.
