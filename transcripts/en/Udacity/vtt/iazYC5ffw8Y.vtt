00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.870
I'll just start with a simple page,

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.200
that has three divs,
contained within a container div.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.830
In normal block layout,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.550
each div is positioned,
one underneath the other one.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.010
But once I add display
flex to the container div,

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.800
the divs, are now shown in a row.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.590
That's because the default
flex direction, is row.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.590
By default,
flex items fit on a single line.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.120
So no matter what I set the width of
the elements to be, they won't wrap.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.380
Instead, the browser will size
them to fit within the viewport.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.450
I can change that, by adding flex-wrap:
wrap; to the container element.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.750
That tells the browser,
that it's okay for

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.720
the elements inside to
wrap to the next line.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.620
Now, as I resize the viewport,
instead of resizing elements,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.410
it wraps the first element.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.300
And then,
only resizes when it really needs to.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.920
So far, we've only looked at two
properties of the flex container.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.650
There are several others
worth looking at.
