00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.815
Say you want to have some pixel have half the intensity of some given pixel.

00:00:03.815 --> 00:00:06.947
Logically, you'd set the pixel's channel values to be half that of the

00:00:06.947 --> 00:00:10.589
original's. This is certainly a reasonable idea, and in fact, I recommend it

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.520
once you have your system set up properly. The only problem is that displays do

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.120
not actually respond to channel settings in this way. A monitor has a power law

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.184
response to an input signal. If you send a signal of say, 0.5, you get a result

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:26.504
down here. You send a signal of 1, double it, you get way more than double the

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:30.748
result. This non-linear response of monitors sounds like something that should

00:00:30.748 --> 00:00:34.656
just get fixed, but it's in fact a feature. It turns out that our eyes have a

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:38.118
similar response curve. A monitor has a limited number of levels of color it

00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:41.910
can display. To get good coverage of levels that the eye can detect, it's a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.690
fine thing to space these levels out in this non-linear way. However, we

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.650
usually think we're calculating colors in a linear space. If I compute a color

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.914
that's half as intense, I expect to see that result. Many applications ignore

00:00:53.914 --> 00:00:57.567
this mismatch between how to calculate color and how to display it. And it's

00:00:57.567 --> 00:01:00.596
less noticeable than you might think. If everything you do is in this space,

00:01:00.596 --> 00:01:04.122
then you often don't feel anything's wrong. It's what you're used to seeing. In

00:01:04.122 --> 00:01:07.182
fact, I'll warn you that many of the shader program examples in this unit

00:01:07.182 --> 00:01:12.600
blithely ignore this problem, since the focus is on keeping the program simple.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.636
However, there are a few important places where computing in the monitor space

00:01:15.636 --> 00:01:19.430
can cause problems. First, lights don't add up correctly. If you have 2

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.048
spotlights overlapping, this area of overlap will not be twice the intensity as

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:27.436
the individual spotlit areas. If you want to be more physically based and be

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:30.019
able to trust that your virtual world has some connection to the real world,

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:35.222
you need to add the lights together sensibly. The hues of colors can shift. As

00:01:35.222 --> 00:01:38.537
you vary the intensity, the channels shift in a nonlinear fashion and so shift

00:01:38.537 --> 00:01:43.408
the perceived hue. Anti-aliasing won't look as good. Say you have a white

00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:47.075
polygon on a black background. If a pixel is half covered by a polygon, it

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:51.270
should be half the intensity as one fully covered by the polygon. If no

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.670
correction's made for the monitor's nonlinear response, the half covered pixel

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.836
will be dimmer. This error will cause even highly sampled pixels to be wrong,

00:01:58.836 --> 00:02:02.659
and give what's called braiding or roping along the edges. I say this a lot,

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.411
but you really owe it to yourself to see the additional course materials for a

00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:10.743
comparison. Mipmapped textures will appear dimmer in the distance. The simplest

00:02:10.743 --> 00:02:14.548
case is the mipmap for a two by two checkerboard pattern. The one by one

00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:18.887
average mipmap is a gray level of 0.5. But as I've said maybe five times now,

00:02:18.887 --> 00:02:22.832
this gray will appear darker on the screen. This can cause textures with high

00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:27.062
contrast to look dimmer, as these lower resolution mipmaps are accessed.
