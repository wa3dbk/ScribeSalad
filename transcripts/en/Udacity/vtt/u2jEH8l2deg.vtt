00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.095
At this point, we need to figure out how
to reach from our code to UI elements.

00:00:05.095 --> 00:00:07.910
The recording and
stop recording buttons.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.360
Need to be able to disable the stop
recording button right before the view

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.220
appears on screen, which should
also disable the recording button

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.660
while the recording is in progress.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.750
What do we use for
going from code to UI element?

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.650
And ib outlet, let's wire up an ib
outlet to the stop recording button and

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.690
another ib outlet to
the recording button.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.920
Follow the instructions below to add
an ib outlet to the stop recording and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.830
recording buttons.
