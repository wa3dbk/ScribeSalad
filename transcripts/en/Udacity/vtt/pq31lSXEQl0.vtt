00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.490
So, since d3's very declarative we only have to specify what we want,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.720
in this case the exposition.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.980
Using this knowledge about data accessers and what you already know about

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.130
d3 functions to change the properties of HTML or SVG elements

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.980
to add some more context to our chart and make a comparison, add d3 code.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.980
To make the home country a red circle and

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.140
leave every other country a blue circle.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.440
And also for each of the games in which the home team is involved in,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.040
let's make them slightly more visible and increase the radius to five.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.340
And remember, as I showed you previously,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.040
we've augmented this data to have both a latitude and a longitude.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.680
As well as a home column that represents the team name of the host country.
