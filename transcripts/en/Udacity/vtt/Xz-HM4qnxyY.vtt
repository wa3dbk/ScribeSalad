00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here is my next quiz for you. Suppose we have a coin with probability p.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For example, p might be 0.5.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You flip the coin twice and I want to compute the probability that this coin

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
comes up head and heads in these 2 flips--obviously that's 0.5 times 0.5.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But I want to do in a way that I can use any arbitrary value for p

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
using the same style of code as before.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So all you're going to modify is the 1-p into something that if I give a probability p

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.492
returns to me the probability of seeing heads twice in this coin--that is the probability of heads.
