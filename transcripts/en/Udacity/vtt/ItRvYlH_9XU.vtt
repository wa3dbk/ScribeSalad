00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.830
There's one last thing I want to
demonstrate with operators and

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.350
that's how the increment and
decrement operators affect assignment.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.955
We'll start by creating
a few variables and

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:12.880
we'll also create a variable
that adds all of these together.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.550
So right now our total
pounds is equal to four.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.910
Now if I use the increment or decrement
operator in front of a variable

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.170
then it's applied before any other
operators in this expression and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.890
that includes the assignment operator.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.390
So if we do ++poundsOfFlour,
then our total pounds is now

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.320
five because the increment is applied
before assignment and we can check to

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.810
see the new value of pounds of flour
which is two after being incremented.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.520
Now if instead I move the increment or
decrement operator after the variable it

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.530
modifies, then it's applied after
the other operators in this expression.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.380
And that again includes assignment.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.840
So in this case we've put the increment
operator after pounds of flour.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.145
And our total pounds is still
the original four pounds, but

00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:00.305
we can see that pounds of flour
has been incremented to two,

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:04.084
it just happened after
the assignment of total pounds.

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:06.715
So you want to be extra careful
when you use these increment and

00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:09.635
decrement operators
because of this nuance.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:11.465
So I'd encourage you
to take some time and

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:14.945
play around with them in a playground
until you feel really comfortable.
