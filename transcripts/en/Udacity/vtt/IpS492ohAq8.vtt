00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.104
Since we're looking for something in the form X minus H squared on the right

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.325
hand side, the result that we need to add on over here is 16. Now of course if I

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:12.412
add something to one side of the equation, I also have to add it to the other

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:16.564
side. Now as we can see from our work in the last quiz, after we add 16 to both

00:00:16.564 --> 00:00:20.785
sides We'll be one step away from writing this in the form that we were aiming

00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:24.978
tor. So I'd like you to do that step of adding 16 and then modify the right hand

00:00:24.978 --> 00:00:28.878
side of the equation so that we get our final equation in the form y minus k

00:00:28.878 --> 00:00:33.035
equals x minus h squared. Put the equation written that way in this box, with of

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:35.424
course the appropriate numbers plugged in.
