00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.788
So we found 3 critical numbers and we know that we're going to have to test each

00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:07.446
of these in an equality to see whether or not it's included in this solution

00:00:07.446 --> 00:00:11.174
set. But in addition to these 3 critical numbers, how many intervals are we

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:14.981
going to need to test? How does this critical number makes up the number line?
