00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's go back to probability and go back to our simplest of all examples--that of a coin flip.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Assume that p is the probability that the coin comes up heads and assume we flip the coin N times--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that is the same as saying that a sample size of N.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It gives us N outcomes and in the past, we computed the empirical mean, the variance,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but now I will let you compute the confidence interval.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Let's start--I'm going to ask you a series of questions, most of them are fairly challenging,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and at the end you'll be able to compute the confidence interval for a sample size N of coin flips.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Let me begin. What is the expected mean outcome when you flip this coin?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Suppose one is heads, 0 is tails--either comes up, it's is 0.5 chance.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This could be a number where the number scales between 0 and 1.

00:00:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It would be 0 if the expected outcome is always tails and be 1 if the expected outcome is always heads.
