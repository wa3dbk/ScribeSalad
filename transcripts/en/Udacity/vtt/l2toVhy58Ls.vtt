00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, let's look at the infection part of the SIR model.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We've got a number of susceptible persons S and we've got a number of infectious persons I,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we watch the model the spread of the disease,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so which of these equations makes more sense for the infection process.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The derivative of the number of infectious persons with respect to time equals 5 * 10⁻⁹ per day

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
times the number of susceptible persons minus 5 * 10⁻⁹ per day times the number

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of infectious persons 5 * 10⁻⁹ per day the number of susceptible persons

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
divided by the number of infectious persons or 5 * 10⁻⁹ per day and person

00:00:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
times the number of infectious persons times the number of susceptible persons.
