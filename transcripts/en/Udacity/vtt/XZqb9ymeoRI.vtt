00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.019
Okay. So I alluded to this before. Cookies are sent

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.700
in HTTP headers. So when a server and, and an HTTP

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.890
response, wants to give you a cookie, wants to assign a

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.580
cookie to your browser it uses a header that looks something

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.051
like this. The header name is Set-Cookie. Like all headers, it's

00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:18.590
followed by a colon and then a space and then the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.650
value of the header. And in this particular case, you say,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.760
name equals value. There are some other parameters you can have

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.352
on the cookie that we'll discuss later but, basically, they use

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:31.600
the Set-Cookie header to, to set cookie named user_id to this

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.690
value. And remember, this is the value, and this is the

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.100
name, and the value can be, you know, up to 4K.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.570
Honestly, I don't know if there's a limit to how big

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.248
the name can be. generally, this is very, very short. If

00:00:43.248 --> 00:00:46.198
the server wants to set, send the multiple cookies, it can

00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:51.030
do so by using multiple Set-Cookie, Cookie headers. There's no restriction

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.660
that says headers have to be unique. A, a server can

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.420
send as many cookies as it wants. It's up to the browser

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.260
to decide whether or not to store them. Remember, I said about

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.920
20 is the max. So try to, try to keep it under

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.410
there. Now, when, when a, this is under Response. Now, in

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.365
future requests, the browser sends its own header, that this is the,

00:01:10.365 --> 00:01:12.300
the name of the header, and remember, this is, you know, this

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.040
is also the name of the header, over here, Set-Cookie and then

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.000
the value of the header, in this case, is user_id

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.950
equals 12345. Again, we have the, the name of the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.990
cookie and the value of the cookie. If we were

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.350
to make this H, this request match what these two cookies

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.590
were to, when our browser sends multiple cookies, it'll look

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.210
something like this, user_id equals 12345; which separates each cookie from

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.750
each other, and then any other cookies. So the browser

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.292
sends one cookie header with all of your cookies in it.

00:01:41.292 --> 00:01:44.360
The semicolon is important and you may be wondering, well, what

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.980
if I want to put a semicolon in my cookie value? And the

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.770
short answer is, don't. And if you really want to, encode

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.860
the cookie value, you know? You, this, this can be whatever you

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.130
want. The browser doesn't care so you can, you can Base64

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.230
it, you can encrypt it, you can ROT13 it, you can do

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.590
whatever you want here but make sure you escape those semicolons

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.330
so you don't goof up your the incoming cookie header. Some frameworks

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.720
will do this for you. We are going to be operating

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.230
at a lower level so that's something you'll want to think about.
