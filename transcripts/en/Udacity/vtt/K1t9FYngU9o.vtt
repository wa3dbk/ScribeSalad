Okay, this exercise is definitely for bonus points. Let's

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.620
say we want to transfer a 64 kilobyte file, over

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.730
a new TCP connection. The round trip time is

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.240
a 100 milliseconds. The Packet size is 1460 bytes. And

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.940
the initial congestion window is 10 packets. How long

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.480
would it take to download this file? Check the instructor

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.340
notes below for a walk through on how to

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.020
compute the answer. Good luck, this was a tricky one.
