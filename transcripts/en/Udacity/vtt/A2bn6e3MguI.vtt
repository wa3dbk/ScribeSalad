00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.190
I chose to delete this edge here.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.020
I started by coloring this vertex green,
and

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.500
then reasoning about what colors
the other vertices might be.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.950
Assuming that I don't delete this edge,
this vertex here has to be orange.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.050
And assuming that I don't delete this
edge here, this one has to be green.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.360
And assuming I don't delete this edge
here, this one has to be orange again.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.510
And that's okay, because this edge here
has one green and one orange vertex.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.170
This vertex here must be green,
since both of its neighbors are orange.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.860
This last vertex here has both green and

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.680
orange neighbors, so
I need to delete one of its edges.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.010
I picked this edge to delete,
and I colored it orange.
