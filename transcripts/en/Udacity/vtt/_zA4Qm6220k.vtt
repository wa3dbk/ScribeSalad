00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Thank you for your hard work. Let's check these inputs one by one.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first one, well this is just tags and no quotes--always has worked.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The second one--well, the second one will have the quote stripped from the input,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but this will not be caught by the assertion because the assertion only checks

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
for the presence of HTML tags and these will be removed.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The third one, however, will not have the HTML tags removed, so this is the correct answer.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And the last one has single quotes and single quotes actually were as they should be.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We can verify this within our programming environment. We can add a simple test here.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is the input which should cause the assertion to fail, press and run,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and as you can see down here, the assertion actually failed.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I leave it to you to try out the other three inputs.
