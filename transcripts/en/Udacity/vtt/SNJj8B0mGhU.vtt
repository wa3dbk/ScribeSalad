00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.100
This class is really built
around the projects.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.320
And while there are some details that'll
change from semester to semester,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.380
there's some principals that
we anticipate staying true for

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.630
the long run.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.020
The first is that this project
is very open ended and

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.240
you have a lot of leeway to
specify what you want to work on.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.590
You might choose to do some research,
you might choose to build a tool.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.008
You might choose to investigate
a current technology,

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.050
you have a lot of room to decide what
you want to work on for the project.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.810
You'll propose it yourself, scope it
out, develop a plan and then execute it.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.760
Second, these projects are intended
to be real contributions to the field

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.310
of educational technology, and so
we want to do as much as possible within

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.550
the semester to get them ready
to take out into the world.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.370
So, this class will culminate in a paper
ready for publication in the conference

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.470
or journal most pertinent to
the work you do in this class.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.240
You don't have to submit it,
of course, but

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.490
we want to have all the work done for
you, so

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.650
that if you would like to take that
next step, you are already ready.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.100
I'll judge the success of this class
based on the extent to which it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.010
generates publications, research
programs, start up businesses or

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.670
tools that we can use here
in the OMSES program.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.810
And third, just as these projects
are intended to be real contributions to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.660
the field of educational technology,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.540
we'd like to treat
them as such ourselves.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.060
So with your permission, we'd like to
include your projects in our course

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.850
library, to provide to future
students in this course.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.490
Maybe they'll borrow from your ideas.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.140
Or maybe, some of them might
even pick up your project and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.940
take it to the next step.
