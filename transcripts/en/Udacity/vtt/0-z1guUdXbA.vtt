That's right Lauren. Cortisol is a hormone produced by the body and it is

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.679
important to give us fuel during emotional arousal and stressful events.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.159
However, cortisol is also a part of the immune system functioning and it

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.987
decreases the number of immune cells available in the blood stream to fight off

00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:21.985
infection. Therefore, when we are stressed we are more likely to get sick. As

00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:26.510
an example, when I was getting ready to write this lesson, I became very sick.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.146
I got a terrible cold. I was really stressed. I had to write this lesson. I was

00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:35.652
behind in my grading. I had theses to review. And on top of it, my poor cat,

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:39.886
Nonsense, was sick. It's no doubt, then, or surprising, why students get sick

00:00:39.886 --> 00:00:44.227
around mid-term and finals. The important thing to remember here, is that when

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:47.811
we experience a stressful event, cortisol is released, which decreases our

00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:52.570
immune system functioning. Now, we're going to go to Greg, and look at how we

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.590
handle stress.
