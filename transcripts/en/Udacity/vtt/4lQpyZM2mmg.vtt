00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's explore a bit more in this brave new world of finite state machines.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Over here, I've drawn a different finite state machine, again with 3 states.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to draw some possible strings down here,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and I want you to check each one that would be accepted by this finite state machine.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So in this multiple multiple-choice quiz, mark each one of these that's accepted

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.092
by this finite state machine.
