00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.773
Now here's the really really way to think about. Are you more likely to use

00:00:02.773 --> 00:00:05.926
situational attributions, or dispositional attributions? That is, are you more

00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:09.348
likely to think that the person is responsible for what happens, or the

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:14.444
situation? Well, as it turns out, different situations call for different types

00:00:14.444 --> 00:00:18.650
of attribution. For example, when evaluating our own behaviour, whether we

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.597
succeed or fail might influence what kind of attributions we use. For example,

00:00:23.597 --> 00:00:26.370
say we did really poorly on a biology test, we might blame the fact that a

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.190
professor was horrible or we didn't know what was going to be on the test, or

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.246
that the test was poorly written. On the other hand, say we got an A on a

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:36.930
statistic exam, we might attribute this good grade to the fact that we're

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.018
really smart or we're really good at statistics. So the attributions we use may

00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:44.240
depend on the situation.
