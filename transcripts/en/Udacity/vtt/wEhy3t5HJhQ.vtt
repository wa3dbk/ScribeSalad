00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.510
Let's take a closer look at that
some of strings function definition.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.870
Function definitions
take the general form.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:06.946
We start with the func

00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:11.506
[MUSIC]

00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:13.850
Oops not that funk.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.130
So func followed by the function
name then a pair of parenthesis,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.710
inside the parentheses,
you'll find the parameters.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.630
Taking the form, parameter name,
colon, parameter type.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.930
Then an arrow pointing
to the return type.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.500
Followed by the executable
statements between curly braces.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.570
So if we look at our
sum of strings method,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.860
we see that it takes in a parameter
called a bunch of strings.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.310
That parameter's of type array,
holding items of type string,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.330
and this function returns
an object of type int.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.790
Let's look at another example.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.620
You've also seen this code before.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.850
The name of this function
is reversedString.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.880
It takes in the string as a parameter,
a parameter named a stringToReverse and

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.240
it returns an object of type string.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.230
Keep in mind that not every
function returns an object.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.410
For example, if reversedString printed
out its result instead of returning it,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.690
the function signature would look
like this no return type, and

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.640
since there's no return type,
no arrow either.
