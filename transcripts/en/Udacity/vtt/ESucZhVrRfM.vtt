00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.010
We use our F statistic to determine if we should accept or reject the null

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.006
hypothesis. Where in this case the null hypothesis would be that the amount

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:12.912
consumed by cows of food a, food b and c are all approximately the same which

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:19.848
we're assuming means that cows do not prefer one type of food over the another.

00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:23.628
And the alternative is that they at least prefer one type of food over the

00:00:23.628 --> 00:00:29.617
other. So we have to compare our F statistic with the critical value. Use the F

00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:33.216
table to find this critical value and then decide, do we accept the null

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:36.820
hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis.
