00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.969
Now thus far, we've talked about interdomain

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.220
routing BGP, or the border gateway protocol,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.280
as consisting of route advertisements solely between

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.140
border routers of adjacent autonomous systems. In fact,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.170
this is a specific type of BGP called external BGP, or EBGP. But in

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.380
fact, as we know, each one of these autonomous systems has routers of its own,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.720
inside. Those routers also need to learn, routes to external destinations.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.640
The protocol that is used to transmit routes inside an autonomous system for

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.990
external destinations, it's called internal BGP or IBGP. Okay, so to review,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.450
external BGP is responsible for transmitting

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.825
routing information between border routers of adjacent

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:56.650
ASs about external destinations. And internal BGP is responsible for

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.480
disseminating BGP route advertisements about external destinations to

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.676
routers inside any particular AS. Note that the distinction

00:01:08.676 --> 00:01:13.820
between IGP and an intra-domain routing protocol or an IGP.
