00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.640
So, how do we do this?

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.490
Now, this will relate back to
the concepts we had looked at

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.970
when we looked at the frequency
domain of an image.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.490
That is,
how do we actually start representing

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.560
things at a different frequency
spectrum and of course,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.730
we played around with
things like the pyramid.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.800
So, to achieve this,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.310
basically we would have to find in
the scale and the pyramids of images,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.450
the most amount of information
in both space and in scale.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.250
Space in this case would
be the image itself.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.540
Scale is, again,
the pyramid levels for example.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.015
Being able to find information
at different frequency spectrum

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:39.540
differently.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.400
So one of the more important methods
that's actually widely used is,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.940
as I said, SIFT,
Scale Invariant Feature Transform.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.780
For this process,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.520
what is suggested is that basically use
the pyramid to find the maximum values.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.350
Again, we use this kind of stuff
to do things like edge detection.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.110
And in this case, then eliminate
the edges and pick only the corners.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.920
So, run the same process that
we've been doing before,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.770
except that now find all edges
using different frequencies and

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.400
then eliminate the edges and
pick only the corners.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.610
So again, the same concept that we've
been doing for corner detection, but

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.920
except we do it at multiple scales.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.290
We find edges at multiple scales.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.640
And then we basically kind of say,
look here.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.640
Which one of them are corners at
each and every one of the scales?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.990
So in essence, what happens now
is that basically each point

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.240
is compared to its eight neighbors,
shown here.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.750
So each point is compared
to its eight neighbors.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.450
And then we can of course
also scale it up and down.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.470
And in this case, each point is also
compared to its nine neighbors above and

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.060
below in scale.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.670
So eight local neighbors at this point,
and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.070
then above, nine points,
below, nine points.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.230
And these are of course different
scales which could be computed using,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.170
again, things like pyramids and
stuff like that we've looked at.
