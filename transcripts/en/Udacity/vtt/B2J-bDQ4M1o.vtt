00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.469
Now that we've decided on our data structure,

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.150
hopefully it will be easy to write the code for building our index.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.880
I think you actually know enough to be able to write the procedure

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.910
that adds new entry to the index.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.210
Your goal for this quiz is to--

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.079
Define a procedure--we'll call it add to index--

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.120
and it takes 3 inputs.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.220
The 1st input is the index that we want to add the new keyword and URL to.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.460
Remember that we decided in the previous question--

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.860
that the way to represent index is as a list

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.900
where each element of the list is itself a list

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.670
and each of the element list is a keyword followed by a list of the URLs

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.840
where that keyword appears.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.370
The 2nd input, is a keyword--that's just a string--

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.740
that's the word that we want to add to the index--

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.580
and the 3rd input is the URL--

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.980
which is a string that encodes the URL where that keyword appears.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.120
So, what add to index should do,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.460
depends on whether or not the keyword that's passed in is already in the index.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.020
If the keyword is already in the index,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.090
we don't want to create a new entry in the index for the keyword.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.430
We only want to have that keyword appear once--

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.860
what we want to do instead is add the URL

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.730
to the list of URLs already associated with that keyword.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.300
So, if the keyword is not in the index,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.770
what we need to do is add a new entry to the index,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.610
and that new entry will be a list with the keyword, that's the new keyword,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.450
and the list the list of URLs where that keyword appears.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.820
This is the first one, since it wasn't already in an index,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.720
so, it will be a list containing just one URL.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.690
That's the list that we want to add to the index

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.230
to represent that we found this keyword at this one URL so far.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.330
Let's work through an example--

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.700
Suppose we start by initializing an index to the empty list--

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.170
we have no entries in our index yet--

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.070
Then we'll call add to index, adding a new keyword,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.040
passing an index as the 1st input,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.140
for the 2nd input we need a keyword

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
let's use the keyword udacity--

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.050
and for the 3rd input we need the URL where that keyword appears.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.590
So, here's what we should have--

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.530
1st we create index, we're initializing it as an empty list, we don't have any elements yet--

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.900
then after we call that index, we're going to add an element to the index list---

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.800
we've mutated index--now it contains element--

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.170
that element is a list containing the string udacity as the keyword--

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.810
the 2nd element of that list is itself a list containing one element--

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.250
which is the string "http://udacity.com"

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.250
That's the new value of index.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.290
If we call out to index again, this time we're passing an index again--

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.890
it's the value that index refers to which is the structure--

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.560
now the keyword is computing,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.530
and we're passing in as the URL "http://acm.org"

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.030
That's going to mutate index again.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.130
We're going to follow the rule here,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.970
the keyword is not in the index, so we should add a new entry.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.900
That means we are going to append a new entry to index.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.900
That new entry is going to have the keyword computing.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.780
As the second element we have a list,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.320
and this list will contain the URL we passed in, which is acm.org.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.650
I am going to show you one more example.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.890
In this case, we're going to pass in a keyword that is already in the index.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.430
We're calling out to index again--passing in the keyword udacity--

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.530
which is already in the index here--

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.900
and passing in a new URL, which is not in the index.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.730
What should happen this time--

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.900
we're going to mutate index, but instead of creating a new element--

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.270
we're going to mutate the element we already have--

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.110
we're going to look for the entry that matches udacity--

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.310
it's already in the index, so don't want to add a new one.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.380
What we're doing is following the 1st rule here--

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.350
that says if the first word is already in the index--

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.990
what we want to do is add new URL to the list of URLs associated with that keyword--

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.820
but we don't want to add any new entries to the index itself.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.660
Here's what that will look like--

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.960
we're adding to the list of URLs a new entry--

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.200
that's the new value of the URL.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.000
I hope it's clear now what add to index should do.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.370
I think you know enough to be able to define it yourself.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.510
That's the goal for this quiz, for you to define the procedure--

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.410
add to index that has this behavior-

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.410
it takes the 3 inputs and adds a new keyword to the index.
