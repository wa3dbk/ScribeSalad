00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.430
Years ago, my professor told me
that as a practicing physician,

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.490
I would probably see patients for
a few minutes every few months, and

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.980
think that what I did then
would make all the difference.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.835
In fact, he said, it was what those
patients did between the visits

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:20.480
that would make the difference.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.030
Today we have a rich set of technologies
and tools to empower patients to be more

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.680
involved in maintaining their own
wellness, preventing disease, and

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.900
managing disease more effectively,
should they develop it.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.020
Understanding these new technologies and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.290
the patient's point of view is
the subject of this lesson.
