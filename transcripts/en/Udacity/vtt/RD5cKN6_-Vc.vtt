00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.610
Here are a few diagrams representing
the difference between hardware pixels

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.430
and dips.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.530
The blue grid represents
a grid of hardware pixels.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.110
So, one pixel, two, three,
four, five, six, et cetera.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.320
And then, the single orange
square represents a single dip.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.352
So in this diagram,
a dip takes up this much space,

00:00:21.352 --> 00:00:23.640
of the hardware pixels,
in this case it takes this much.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.715
In this case it takes up this
much of the hardware pixels,

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:32.659
in here it only takes
up one hardware pixel.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:39.230
So which of these diagrams represents
a device pixel ratio of two.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.260
Remember, the device pixel
ratio compares the number of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.730
pixels in just one dimension, not two.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.920
So think one dimension.
