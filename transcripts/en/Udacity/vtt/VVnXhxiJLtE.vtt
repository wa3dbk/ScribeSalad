00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.990
The situation we want to consider next is what if we need to

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.930
do more than one broadcast? So let's say we have this situation. You know,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.930
we have some instructions renamed, there is the register file here.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.850
We have some reservation stations. But, the situation is that somehow this

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.805
divide here has finished in the multiply divide unit,

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:26.250
at the same cycle when the add here has finished in the add unit and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.015
now we, if we have only one of these broadcast buses that we can use to

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:34.497
broadcast the result, the question is, which one of these goes first?

00:00:34.497 --> 00:00:40.540
There are first of all, several possibilities for how to support this impasse.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.720
For example, you could have a separate broadcast bus for each of the units. So,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.780
normally you have one of these buses. If you have a separate bus,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.740
note that there will be twice as many comparators basically for

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.190
each of the operands for each of the instructions in the reservation stations.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.670
We need to try to match each of the tags that are being broadcast and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.300
be able to select the result or not depending on whether it matches.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.010
So there will be twice as much matching hardware if we had two buses.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.590
Similarly here and here you will have to be able to write the results and so on.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.145
So if you have only one bus then the question is, which one do we broadcast. And

00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:22.400
usually, you either just make one unit be the highest priority unit and

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.750
the other ones are kind of less priority than that so that you always know.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.500
I mean, you, we, we need to choose very quickly which one is going to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.110
be broadcast. It doesn't matter so much which one it is as much as it

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.440
matters that it's only one. So basically, one of them needs to be picked.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.350
A very common heuristic is that if one of the units is known to be

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.660
slower than the other, let's say that the multiplication and

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.320
divide are slower than adds and subtracts and so on, which is usually the case.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.340
Then, what you want to do is give the priority to the slower unit.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.600
Why? Well, because those instructions have been executing for

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.720
a while longer. So what's going to happen is those instructions are going to

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.460
have more dependencies probably waiting for them. Pretty much,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.530
there are more instructions piled up to use these results. So it's, so

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.170
it's kind of like an age based thing, but instead of considering the age of each

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.730
instruction, in which case we would have to carry additional information here.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.690
What we do is we simply give the priority to the smaller unit.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.880
So this is a very common heuristic and that's usually what ends up being used.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.450
If you really want to be kind of better than that, then you would, you know,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.570
carry the age of the instruction in which case you can do age based thing, which

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.390
amounts to almost the same thing. Because usually these instruction's going to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.530
be older here just because they're kind of slower to execute to begin with.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.200
Or you do something slightly more advanced than that. But again, it's a very

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.700
common heuristic that we just used. Basically, the multiplication divide unit is

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.460
going to have priority in this case over the add and subtract unit.
