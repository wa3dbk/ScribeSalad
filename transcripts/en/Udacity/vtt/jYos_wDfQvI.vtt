We're going to start this course by
trying to understand why cyber security

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.493
has become such a huge problem.

00:00:06.493 --> 00:00:10.070
We're going to do this by developing
what we call a security mindset.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.730
Once we're done with that we're
going to talk about a number of

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.100
basic design principles that can help
us better secure computer systems.
