00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.350
So now let's start thinking about what are Good Features that we can find

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.780
between two images of the similar scene or a same object, that we can then

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.239
use to be able to register that same feature for across two different images.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.670
I'm going to use this simple object of a water bottle to

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.420
help us illustrate this.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.270
So as I've said before, we are interested in extracting features.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.450
Basically, we want to find parts of an image that let's us encode that image in

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.780
a compact form, so then I can do comparisons from one image to the other.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.390
I'm going to propose the concept of Edges here.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.690
Edges on an image, in a variety of ways,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.120
basically could be one way of encoding such an information.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.240
So what kinds of information do we want to look at?

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.460
Basically what we want to look for

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.680
is various forms of discontinuities in an image or a scene, and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.950
that basically is one of the ways to think about what an edge is.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.700
So, an edge in an image basically is trying to capture the discontinuity in

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.750
a scene, and use that to be able to then find information that would be again,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.850
somewhat repeatable across images.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.870
We'll look at these more in detail.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.890
So let's look at, for example, this water bottle.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.640
And see what kind of changes in the scene we could actually look for.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.830
And actually look for certain discontinuities in this.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.370
So, for example, at the water bottle at the top of it you basically if I was to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.910
start growing surface normals,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.200
you would basically see the surface normals going this way.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.690
And, after a while,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.990
there are no more surface normals because they are on the other side.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.520
So, this form of discontinuity, if there was a sudden change in it,

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.310
would allow us to start thinking about how we could actually look for

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.610
discontinuities of this form and the surface normals.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.540
So those would be surface normal discontinuities.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.210
Let's look at depth discontinuities.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.270
In this case, of course, we know there's an object of course, and it might be in

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.760
front of something, so by just being able to look at the, you know, the sides

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.070
here, you know that anything behind that would be at a different depth.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.850
This would be in front of everything behind that.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.419
So that would be a depth discontinuity.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:15.000
How can we actually look at the term water here, and be able to separate it out?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.110
Well, in this case, if you can notice is,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.430
water is written with a different color than the background.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.680
So surface color is basically also a cue, a discontinuity that we can look at,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.720
that basically points out how we can actually separate out terms like water, or

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.220
even this band here.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.350
Or, in fact, even looking at how we can take difference between the bottle and

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.530
the cap here.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.190
Another form of discontinuity is illumination.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.340
This object, of course, is being lit in different ways.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.160
And, of course it, creates a shadow.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.750
Or it could actually have other types of reflections and specularities and stuff

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.900
like that, that are also coming in because of the lighting conditions on it.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.390
That basically is referring to discontinuities because of lighting changes and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.980
such on the object.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.760
So hopefully you see now, that by just looking at various types of

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.850
discontinuities, we can start extracting some information about an image.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.450
So of course, what we now want to do is go back to the image itself and look for

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.080
certain sets of discontinuities that would basically best capture the changes

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.270
because of the normals the depth, surface color, and illumination.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.470
Of course, that is a rather big problem and

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.330
we should be looking at it, and this is one of the bigger things we look at in

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.040
computer vision when we do analysis of scenes.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.811
Now one thing I wanted to emphasize here,

00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:35.770
this is an extremely important concept.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:42.440
The Edges basically are encoding change in a spatial way of looking at an image.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.440
Anywhere afterwards I look for a change, and

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.870
that chain encodes a lot of information.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.555
And in fact some may argue that this is a very important set of

00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:53.350
informations about an image.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.928
So in a information theoretic manner,

00:03:54.928 --> 00:03:59.420
what we an actually say that edges and basically are encoding change, and

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.070
therefore are an efficient way to encode an image.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.170
So basically any time I can think about an image is,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.080
if I can start looking at where the changes are, that basically starts giving me

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.390
a lot of information about what the image would be,

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.820
because now I've actually taken a a differential code to represent an image.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.880
Wherever there are changes, I'm going to highlight those.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.730
We'll look at that a little bit more carefully in a bit.
