We find that for the equation, 5y equals 10x, we can end up with y equals 2x.

00:00:05.707 --> 00:00:10.905
And we can change negative 3x plus y plus 2 equals 0, so that instead it reads,

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:16.923
y equals 3x minus 2. I just used the same tools that we used in previous lessons

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:22.045
to isolate y in each equation. So, even if an equation isn't initially written

00:00:22.057 --> 00:00:26.535
in the form, y equals mx plus b, as long as its graph is a straight line and, of

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:30.925
course, it's not a vertical line, it can be arranged so it does fit this form.

00:00:31.027 --> 00:00:35.520
And, of course, once we get it in that form, it's super-easy for us to find the

00:00:35.532 --> 00:00:38.150
slope and the y-coordinate at the y-intercept.
