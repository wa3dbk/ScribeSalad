00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.390
Here's the result of
the entire post condition for

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.470
the permutation function.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.940
Okay, we'll say that X is
a permutation of Y, if and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.290
only if one of the three,
any one of the three cases hold.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.520
The first case was that the vector
was empty, then it's a permutation.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.900
Or the second case was if
it's non empty and the first

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.020
elements are the same then it's
a permutation if the tails are the same,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.600
and the third case was it's non empty,
the first elements don't match,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.080
and there is some place
in the output vector Y,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.241
where the first element does occur, and
we're going to call that position J,

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:50.730
and it's then the case that there's
a permutation between the tail of X and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.850
the results of pasting together
the segment before the J position

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.610
with the segment that comes
after the J position.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.530
Please make sure you
understand this example.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.560
It's the toughest bit of specification
we'll see in these lessons.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.890
And it's important for you if you're
going to be able to express things

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.650
precisely that you understand how we
approach this particular problem.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.570
&gt;&gt; I think that second case was, you
said the first elements in both X and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.160
Y hold, and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.240
then the remaining tails of both X and
Y are permutations of each other.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.740
Not the same as each other like,
is that okay?

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.080
&gt;&gt; So, you got me there.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.590
And but, one of the points we're making
with this is that same elements as is,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.020
the same thing as permutation.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.810
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.100
So, I did state it incorrectly.
