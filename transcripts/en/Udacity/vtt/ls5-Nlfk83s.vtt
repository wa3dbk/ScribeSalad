00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.120
The problem here, is that the computer, works

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.250
internally in a different number system called the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.870
binary number system, and there's no exact representation

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.890
for 4.35 in that system. It's kind of

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.738
similar to your pocket calculator. When you divide

00:00:15.738 --> 00:00:18.398
ten by three, you get 3.3333 and so

00:00:18.398 --> 00:00:21.766
on. And then when you multiply again with

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.630
three, you would get 9.999999 and so on.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.700
And the reason is that there is no

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.659
exact representation for the fraction ten over three

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.640
in the decimal system. Now as programmers, we

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.560
don't usually worry about the detail reasons why these

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.160
round of errors occur, we just have the

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.480
general intuition that floating point numbers are a little

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.890
bit fuzzy. Just like the fuzzy photo over

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.240
here, you can't quite rely on every last pixel.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.330
So when you get a number like 434.999 and

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.250
so on, that's just something we have to deal with.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.750
Now, in this case, if we don't want to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.150
lose any pennies, the remedy would be to use integers

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.620
and work in pennies. If this had been 435

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.700
pennies as an integer, a 100 times 435 would not

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.800
have been a problem. There are several other number

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.300
types in Java that you may need in more technical

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.920
situations, we've prepared a fact sheet for you. Go ahead, read through

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.840
the worksheet, and then work with Sarah on a few quiz questions
