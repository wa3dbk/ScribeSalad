00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.560
By now you should have a clear
picture of the key differences

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.580
between chronic and acute diseases.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.600
Unlike acute medical problems,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.660
chronic diseases are more often caused
by behavior, generally can't be cured.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.000
And particularly if not well managed
can cause other chronic diseases and

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.860
complications that are difficult and
expensive to treat.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.680
Now with Marla's help,
we'll turn again to what for

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.680
our purposes is probably the key issue
with respect to chronic disease.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.299
Though they're very common,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.100
our healthcare system is not
well designed to manage them.
