00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.660
So now that we have run our program, let's see what

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.660
happens exactly when you run a program within Eclipse. And to

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.410
do that I'm going to use the menu over here which is

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.500
the Run menu and I'm going to select Run Configurations, and this

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.190
brings up a window where you can change or run configurations.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.200
Well first of all, you can see that here on the

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.260
left under Java application. Eclipse automatically created a Hello World run

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.300
configuration for our program. And this is where you can configure

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.370
the different parameters for your execution. For example,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.520
you can select the main class. So here

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.745
it's, obviously, edu.gatech.HelloWorld. You can define different program

00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:36.920
arguments. We don't have any for now. You can

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.480
also pass arguments to the virtual machine. You

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.960
can define which Java runtime environment you want to

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.720
use, Classpath and other environmental options. So let's

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.650
now try to pass some arguments to our program.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.390
So for example here, I am just going to write George as

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.450
a possible parameter. I say Apply so that modify the configuration and

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.510
if i run the program of course, the output is not changing

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.440
because my program does not use the argument. But, let's see if

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.060
we do use the argument, what happens. So I'm going to slightly

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.030
modify the final program so that now, instead of printing hello

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.420
world, it will print hello followed by the first argument that I

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.700
will pass to the program. And if I do that, and I

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.420
go and I run the program, what I get is exactly what I

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.420
was expecting, which is Hello George. So this is the way in which you

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.120
can pass arguments to your execution, which

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.640
is something that might come in handy

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.390
for some other projects. When you need to run some code with an argument.
