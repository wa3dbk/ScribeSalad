00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.560
Here's the project in Adam and

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.250
let's look through some
of the files it gives us.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.990
We've got a bunch of files for
set up, package managers and testing.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.160
Up in the directories the important
ones are public, dist, config, and app.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.680
You put your static assets like
font files and images in here.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.980
When you're ready to move your site
to the web, Ember can build and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.410
bundle everything together and
put it in here.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.020
Configure is where you add code that
changes the configuration of the project

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.698
or if the project needs to change
based on the environment it's in.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:36.250
But probably 99% of your time will
be spent in the app directory.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.450
Let's go through it.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.420
Ember is highly dependent on routes.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.910
So router dot.js is not
hidden away in a folder.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.510
We'll be looking at routes and
routing next.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.700
Here's the apps index file, we actually
won't really be touching any of this.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.810
Here's the project's main set of file,
we also aren't going to be doing

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.270
anything in here either,
templates are very important to Ember.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.600
Any HTML we write will be in here.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.690
Remember when we looked at
our app in the browser and

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.600
it said welcome to Ember?

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.380
That file is right here.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.540
Styles is for where we can put
any custom CSS for our project.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.120
I said routing is important to Ember.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.960
Not only is there router file, but
there's also this routes directory.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.700
This is where individual
route files will live.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.290
We'll be looking at this next.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.690
Models is where we would put
schema files for the apps data.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.450
If we want to add additional
functionality to our templates,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.190
we'd create helper files and
place them in here.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.480
In Ember, controllers are very
similar to components and

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.680
are actually being phased
out in future versions.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.880
So we won't be working with controllers.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.910
Ember makes it really easy to create
our own custom HTML elements.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.770
It refers to them as components.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.730
The functionality goes in here, while
a component's HTML file goes in here.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.350
All of this was generated
with the ember-new command.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.410
Ember favors convention
over configuration,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.690
meaning that Ember has its
way of doing things and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.950
as long as you do it the Ember way, you
won't have to worry about configuration.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.290
An example of this is where to
put a file and how to name it.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.640
A component has to live in
the components directory and

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.280
be named a certain way.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.850
We don't want to worry about all
of embers conventions though, so

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.410
we'll just use embers CLI to
generate and maintain our files.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.230
The first thing to do with
a new app is to set up routing.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.360
So let's set up some routes.
