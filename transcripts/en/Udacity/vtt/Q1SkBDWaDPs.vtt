00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.230
Now suppose that the teacher gives the error program this example as the second

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.390
example, and the teacher also tells the error program this is a positive

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.260
example, so these are labeled examples. Here's a representation of the second

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.840
example. Again, I have done the variabilization, so the constant here, Brick A,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.580
has been replaced by Brick. This was the current concept definition of the AI

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.190
program for the concept of arch. And here is a new example.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.080
How should the AI programmer revise its current concept definition of an arch in

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.320
order to accommodate this positive example? Because it is a positive example,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.070
therefore the AI program should try to generalize. So one good way of

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.848
generalizing the current concept definition is to drop this link.

00:00:44.848 --> 00:00:49.140
If the AI program can drop this link, in that case this will be

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.240
the new current concept definition. Note that this current

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.850
concept definition covers both the second example, as well as the first example.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.770
This is called the drop-link heuristic. It's a heuristic because as we

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.058
discussed earlier, a heuristic is a rule of thumb. So here is what has happened.

00:01:07.058 --> 00:01:11.330
When an AI program needs to learn from a very small set of examples,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.530
just one example or two examples, then the possible generalizations and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.050
specializations, the learning space, is potentially very large.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.240
In order to guide the AI program about how to navigate the learning space, we'll

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.060
develop some heuristics. The first such heuristic is drop a link if you need to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.540
generalize in such a way that the new concept can cover both earlier examples.

00:01:36.684 --> 00:01:41.490
So drop-link heuristic is useful when the structure of the current

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.650
concept definition and the structure of the new example have a lot of overlap.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.670
They overlap almost exactly, except for one link that is extra in

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.940
the current concept definition. The extra link can be dropped because in the new

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.370
definition will cover both the previous concept as well as the new example.
