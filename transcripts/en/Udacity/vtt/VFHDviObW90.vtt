Let's try another kilometer problem. You walk 3/8 of a kilometer and 3/7 of a

00:00:04.085 --> 00:00:08.032
kilometer one day, how far did you walk? Before we solve this problem like the

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:12.162
others, let's make a prediction. Did you walk less than a kilometer, exactly a

00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:16.285
kilometer, or more than 1 kilometer? Use the 2 number lines to help you out. We

00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:20.495
have 1 full kilometer, and this is 3/8 of that kilometer. I have three out of

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:24.480
eight parts of the kilometer. Here, the kilometer has been split into seven

00:00:24.492 --> 00:00:28.625
equal pieces and I have 3/7 of the kilometer length. Choose the best one.
