00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In all of this, changes in size, changes in language,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
changes in speed, or changes in the program itself

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
are all obstacles for record, replay, reproduction

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of graphical user elements.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
A better option is to have the GUI elements themselves do the recording.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That is, when I'm clicking in here

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the search button knows it has been pressed, and what I am recording

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
right now is not the fact that I clicked in this particular area of the screen,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but what is recorded right now is that the search button has been pressed.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Likewise, if we enter text in this field, what will be recorded is that

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
in the URL GUI element, the text foo was entered.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This way, if anything in the resolution changes or if the position changes,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the events will still be tied to the GUI elements,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and therefore, our recording becomes independent

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
of the actual rendering on the screen.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This of course is also true for rearrangements as long as

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the identifiers of the GUI elements stay the same,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
we'll still be able to replay earlier logs even though many details,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
in terms of the rendering, have changed.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The best capture replay tools offer facilities to record

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and replay at the low levels.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That is, mouse clicks and keystrokes,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but also facilities to replay at higher levels.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That is, directing some input specifically toward

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
some element of the graphical user interface.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
For web pages, the Selenium Toolkit offers

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
a nice mix of multiple abstraction layers.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Check out what kind of tools are available for your specific environment

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and test them thoroughly before making a purchase.
