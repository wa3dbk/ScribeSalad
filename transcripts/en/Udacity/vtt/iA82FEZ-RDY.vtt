00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.790
Now let's define the other problem that
will be part of our example reduction.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.450
Vertex Cover.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.010
Given a graph G, a subset of
the vertices is a vertex cover,

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.630
if every edge is incident
on a vertex in S.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.079
To illustrate, consider this graph here.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.710
The two shaded vertices do
not form a vertex cover.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.550
We haven't covered this edge here,
or this one here.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.300
On the other hand, these two
vertices do form a vertex cover,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.670
because every edge is
incident on one of these two.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.300
Clearly, the set of all
vertices is a vertex cover, so

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.060
the interesting question is,
how small a vertex cover can we get?

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.970
Or, phrased as a decision question,
we're given a graph G and

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.370
an integer k,
at most the number of vertices.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.387
The question is,
does G have a vertex cover of size k?

00:00:50.387 --> 00:00:53.290
Note that this problem is also in NP.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.490
It's easy enough to check whether
a subset of vertices is of size k,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.570
and whether it covers all the edges.
