00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.310
Talk a little bit more about what
happens when you open a file,

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.460
and how does access
control factor into it.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.260
So, process here is making these
calls we're talking about.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.650
It first opens this file F,
without specifying the mode here,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.930
but maybe this is read.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.380
This line is going from user
to the operating system,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.230
system call,
this is the boundary between the two.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.150
This is untrusted, this is trusted,
as we talked about.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.320
So, this is all in the operating system.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.670
So basically,
the file got stored on the disk, and

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.450
files that are actively being accessed,
the operating system keeps track of

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.120
those information about a particular
file is in a file control block.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.300
So if you've done
the operating system's class,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.710
you have some idea of how
file systems are implemented.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.630
But for each file that we want
to access, we you know meta-data

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.020
that we're talking about for
a file you know what's the file pointer,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.300
where should we read next,
where on disk the file blocks are.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.870
Other kind of information.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.380
We keep track of that in
the file control log.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.590
In Unix, well that's called an i-node,
and there's a table of these.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.500
That's where this i-node table stores
the meta-data about the active or

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.830
currently open files.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.430
So this is, here,
I'm saying it file meta-data table.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.160
A file that you're going to
open has to be active,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.770
it it's not active,
it's going to get activated.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.210
So, there's something interesting
happen, when you open a file you tell

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.270
the filename, the operating system's
actually is going to go and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.030
say, is this file currently active.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.110
If it is active then there is going to
be a file control block for it, okay.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.820
That's where the meta-data for
this file is going to be.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.550
So a process also has another data
structure that's called an open

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.490
file table.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.420
Okay this is kept by
the operating system.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.030
It's per process data
structure we're talking about.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.440
So in this open file
table that we have for

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.640
this process that is making
this open call, basically what

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.300
we want to do in the open call is that
we want to see if the file is active.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.440
If it is then there is a meta-data
block or file control block for it.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.590
In the open file table, there is
some set of entries that we have.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.470
This is a fixed sized table.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.300
We're going to use one of those entries
to actually store a pointer to this.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.340
And the file descriptor we
return is actually nothing but

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.560
an index into this table.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.230
So i is the index in this
table that we're returning.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.678
I think it was about access
check when do we perform.

00:02:22.678 --> 00:02:28.370
Actually in Unix-based systems, access
control is done when you open the file.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.050
At the time the file is opened
remember we're going to go in,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.990
we're going to find out if
the file is currently active or

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.390
not, we're going to locate its file
into a block where the meta-data is.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.350
In particular the ACL is here too.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.610
With the ACL is here, then it was
nine bits that I was talking about.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.340
Depending on the user or
group the user is part of.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.150
I'm actually going to look at those
ACL bits that we're discussing.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.220
And if the mode here is read, and you
have read information, I do all this.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.010
Okay?
I'm going to grant you access

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.330
Mode is right and
the right permission is here.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.980
I'm going to do all of this and
give you write permission and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.488
to place data in this file.

00:03:05.488 --> 00:03:09.590
So access check is going to happen
during the open calls execution in

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.560
the operating system because we
locate this information where the ACL

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.740
information is and
we're going to look that up.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.420
And if everything checks out we set
this up and return this file descriptor.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.430
So the reason we do it at
the time it's open is,

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.040
that when you come to read,
you specify a file descriptor.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.960
So, it's going to say read I here,
for exam, that's what you're saying.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.320
Well, once I come to the operating
system, it's the that remember is

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.820
an index into a table, that tells me,
it's this particular entry in the table.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.880
Follow the pointer that it points to,
that's where the file meta-data is, and

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.960
that tells you where the file data is.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.170
I don't do any access check at
the time I do a read or write.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.770
I just sort of quickly follow these
pointers and get to the file.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.360
If I'm doing reads then I
find the file data to return

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.800
to copy that into the buffer.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.400
If I'm doing a write then I copy the
data from the buffer into file cache or

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.350
something like that.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.640
It gets copied.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.960
So there's no check done during
either read call or a write call.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.700
The check was done when we did the open,
okay.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.810
So the fact that the script
was returned to you

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.990
at that time we did the checking and
now you're able to do that.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.839
If we opened it for read and
you tried to do write, of course.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.320
Of course we're going to stop that.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.270
Okay.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.890
That goes without saying.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.800
We don't have to go look for

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.850
the particular to do the transversal
that we are talking about.
