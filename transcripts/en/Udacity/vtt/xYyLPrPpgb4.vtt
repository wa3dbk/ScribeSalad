00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.211
I'm here with Dr. Bill Dally, who is Chief Scientist and Senior Vice president of Research NVIDIA.

00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:07.080
Welcome, Bill.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.680
Well, thanks John. It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.750
I'm glad to have an opportunity to chat with you about important trends in computing.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.921
Super, tell us about your job in NVIDIA. What do you do?

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:18.671
I really have two jobs.

00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:23.810
As Chief Scientist, I get to sort of look into a lot of neat technologies that we're developing

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.181
and try to set technical directions in certain strategic areas work with key customers

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:32.115
and partners on technology initiatives.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:37.190
And then as Senior Vice President of Research, I build and lead NVIDIA Research,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.428
which is a world class research lab doing research in a lot of interesting areas from graphics to parallel computing

00:00:42.428 --> 00:00:47.065
to circuits and architecture programming systems relevant to the future of NVIDIA.
