00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.318
Remember that x squared. It's just x times x or 2 x's multiplied together. X to

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.267
the 4th is just 4 x's multiplied together and we're also multiplying that by

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:15.462
another 3 x's that are multiplied together. So here we have a big string of x's

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:20.127
all multiplied together, just like we would expect, considering how many

00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:24.851
exponents we see here, but the same base of over and over again. So, in total

00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:29.500
here we have 9 x's all multiplied together. And we know that this just equals x

00:00:29.512 --> 00:00:33.803
to the 9th power. However, we can or rule to do this in a much shorter and

00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:38.006
easier way. We can get the same answer by just adding these 3 exponents

00:00:38.018 --> 00:00:43.190
together. We know that our base is still x, but our power is just 2 plus 4 plus

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:47.006
3. 2 plus 4 is 6, plus 3 is 9. So we get the same answer.
