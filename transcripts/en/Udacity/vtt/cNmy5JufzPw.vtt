00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.510
One last important statistic
on a stock that's important

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.090
is called cumulative returns.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.220
So let's consider S&amp;P 500,
again, back in 2012.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.099
Now in 2012,
the S&amp;P 500 started the year

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.370
at $125, and it ended the year at $142.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.830
When you listen to the news
you hear things like, for

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.860
the year 2012 S&amp;P 500 gained 13.6%.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.250
That is cumulative return.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.670
You don't hear them say over 2012
S&amp;P 500 went from $125 to $142.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.040
So how do you calculate
these cumulative returns?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.260
It's really easy.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.480
Here's the equation.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.030
The cumulative return for
a particular day,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.350
t, is just today's price divided
by the price at the beginning.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.450
So price of zero is over here, and

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.130
the price of any particular day,
say would be here.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.550
And we can calculate
the value like this.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.900
Now the cumulative return for the whole
period is where t is this last day.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.220
So let's consider
the example we've got here.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.010
To calculate the cumulative return for
this whole year.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.017
It's the price at the end, divided by
the price at the beginning, minus one.

00:01:22.017 --> 00:01:30.490
Turns out 142/125 is 1.136- 1 gives
us .136 Which is equal to 13.6%.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.625
So our cumulative return for

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:39.830
the ETF SPY was 13.6%.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.040
We can calculate and chart cumulative
returns just like we did earlier for

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.370
daily returns,
except now the plot is showing us

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.880
the cumulative return of course
instead of the data return.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.770
Note that the shape of the chart
is the same as the price chart.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.710
It's just now it's normalized, and

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.300
in fact this equation is exactly
our normalization equation.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.590
So that is how to calculate and
plot cumulative returns.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.250
We're not going to have Dave show you
how to do that, you're on your own

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.030
there, now that you know how to do daily
returns, it shouldn't be that tough.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.200
Okay, that's it for this lesson,
we'll see you again soon.
