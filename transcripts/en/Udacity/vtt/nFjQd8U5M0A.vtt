00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
For this next problem, we're going to be looking at

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.800
some tricky behavior of O notation when we're dealing with numbers.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.240
To illustrate this, let's take a look at the number 4000.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.100
Now 4000 has a magnitude of size of well 4000

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.360
but you can write it down with a lot less than 4000 digits.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.140
In fact, you can write it down with 1, 2, 3, 4 digits.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.490
So it's actually a logarithmic number of digits in relation to the size of the number.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:43.850
Similarly, if we wanted to write down 40,000, which is 10 times as big as 4000,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.800
we only need to write down well 5 digits.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.470
So the number of digits is growing logarithmically with the size

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.730
of the number that we want to represent.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.890
Now, let's say we call the actual number we want to represent n.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.590
And let's say the number of digits necessary to represent n, we'll call d.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.690
And now, let's take a look at a fairly simple algorithm to test whether n is prime.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.770
So we have this basic isprime function to test whether n is prime.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.620
And it does this by first checking if n is less than 2

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.440
since 0 and 1 are not prime and returning false in that case.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.570
If n equals 2, then we return 2 because 2 is prime and then we get rid of all the even numbers

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.620
because none of the even numbers other than 2 are prime.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.520
And then we check if there are any odd numbers between 3 and the √n that divide n.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.320
Because if there are any numbers that divide n, then it's not prime.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.500
And it turns out to check for primality, you actually only need to check up to the √n

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.490
and we're not going to get into why that is the case right now because well that's another course.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.030
But if it finds any numbers that divide n then we return false

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.860
and otherwise we go all the way through this and return true.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.840
So my first question is, which of these answers best characterize the asymptotic running time

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.130
of this primality algorithm as a function of n, the value of the input size?

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.770
Is it a constant order? Logarithmic? Is it in the order of √n? Is it linear? Quadratic?

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.720
Or does it turn out that this is exponential?

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.760
And my second question is, what about if we express the running time as a function of d,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.130
the number of digits that it takes to represent the number

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.890
rather than as a function of n, the actual value of the number?

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:45.070
If we express the running time in this way, then is it linear in the number of digits? Quadratic?

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.150
Does it grow to the 10th power? Does it grow 10 to the log of d? 10 to the d/2?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.620
10 to the √d? Or 10 to the d? Check whichever one is best.
