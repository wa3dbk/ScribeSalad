00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.150
First, let's start with two key concepts, states and events. Both of

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.870
these are abstract but nevertheless useful in describing system behavior.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.950
A state is an abstract description of a set of

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.440
system values at a given point of time. For example, it's raining outside.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.880
This is actually some estimation or abstraction over the amount of precipitation

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.490
in the air at a given point in time. Let's imagine a slightly more complex

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.120
situation in the imaginary town of Des Cartes Iowa, that has ten streets and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.820
eight avenues laid out in an orthogonal grid. And let's say we

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.860
were trying to imagine the state of the town that had one car in it.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.690
The position of that car in this imaginary scenario is at third street and

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.700
fifth avenue. The number of possible states it could be in is 80, ten streets,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.200
eight avenues. For two cars though, the number of possible states,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.080
goes up with a square. That is, 80 times 80 or 6400 possible states.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.490
The State Space of a system, is a set of possible states,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.170
and its size goes up, multiplicatively, with a number of different

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.860
attributes that we're trying to capture. And the number of possibilities,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.890
that each attribute has. This is called the state explosion problem.
