00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.070
That ends the lesson on PCA.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.660
It's a very general method.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.670
People use principle
components all the time.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.670
And the face recognition method is
just what we use to introduce it.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.780
Although I will say, it's become very
well known because, not just because how

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.760
well it worked and caught,
sort of caught people by surprise, but

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.860
just it had this very
clean interpretation.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.220
In fact, now people, you'll hear,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.300
instead of eiganfaces,
you'll hear about eigangaits.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.070
Right?
So you,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.080
you take measurements of people walking,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.159
you try to find a principle component
analysis, project them down and do it.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.260
There are eigan body shapes,
which is terrifying to think about, but

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
basically the idea of, I've, you know,
people vary in different shapes, and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.560
I should be able to take a small
number of variations and

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.410
say I can fit you by just
a small number of control knobs.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.625
If you're doing computer graphics
animation, and you want to be able to

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:51.843
control the different shapes of
people to build different characters,

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:54.320
you want to be able to just turn
a small number of knobs and

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.170
have people change their overall build,
their height, and things like that.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.150
And you can use this,
principal component analysis, or

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.550
more sophisticated versions of it,
to do that.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.850
The method that I've shown you
here also is a linear method.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.820
Right?
All these things are orthogonal.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.530
And I could compute the coefficients
by just taking the dot products.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.500
And that's a nice property to have,
it makes things easy to do, but

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.496
it's also a liability.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.606
If I have a, just say,
a three-dimensional space,

00:01:22.606 --> 00:01:26.610
suppose I have points that actually
just lie along a curve, okay?

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.430
So they are all on a single curve,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.540
which means if you just told
me the value along that curve,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.750
that would represent the point
completely, assuming I knew the curve.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.690
But it's not a line, it's a curve,
okay, so it, it bends.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.480
So there are non-linear methods of doing
principal component analysis that allow

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.850
you to capture, sort of non-linear,
lower-dimensional manifolds.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.004
We won't talk about it here, but,

00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:56.570
in fact there's one's called
non-linear kernel PCA.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.700
But for now, all you need to know
about is what we talked about here,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.950
linear orthogonal decomposition
of principle components.
