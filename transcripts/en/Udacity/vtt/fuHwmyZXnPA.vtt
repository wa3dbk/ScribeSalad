00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.710
So let's look at the load linked/store
conditional instructions,

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.930
which usually we call LL/SC instruction.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.090
We have them because atomic reading and
writing in the same instruction

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.810
even if we just do the write, if the
read has tested positive for something.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.020
Is really bad for
pipelining your processor.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.080
Let's look at the classical five stage
pipeline where we fetch the code and

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.480
read registers.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.960
Do the area operation.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.240
This is where compute the address for
memory instructions.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.440
Then we have a memory axis stage and
finally, we write the result

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.920
to a register, if a register
result exists in the instruction.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.760
Loads will be fetched, decoded and
read the register, compute the address

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.280
using that register, access memory to
get the value from that address and

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.658
then write the result to a register.

00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:55.120
An atomic read/write instruction,
such as a swap, or test and

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.750
set, or test and write, would compute
the address and read registers.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.160
And then when it gets
to the memory stage,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.540
it cannot do everything it needs
to do in one access to memory.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.860
because loads and
stores do either a read or a write.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.410
A read/write instruction
needs to do both and

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.770
that cannot be done
in the same cycle for

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.810
the same memory location without really
complicating the memory stage a lot.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.970
So just for the sake of atomic
read/write instructions, we would need

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.080
to add memory 2 stage, possibly memory
3, so that they can read the memory,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.700
do some checking and
then finally write the memory.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.940
So we would be adding to our
pipeline several stages,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.990
possibly, just for
these instructions, but

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.560
remember that every instruction flows
through the pipeline the same way.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.940
So if we add these two stages for
these instructions we really have added

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.110
two stages for all instructions,
which is not very good.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.470
because these are actually not going to
execute that frequently to justify this.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.310
So we will separate the atomic read and
write into two instructions.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.060
The first will be a load
linked instruction.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.140
Its purpose is to implement the read
part of the atomic operation.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.970
What it does is it behaves
just like a normal load.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.250
It just reads from a memory location and
puts the value in a register.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.770
But in addition to that,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.630
it saves the address from which it
loaded into a special link register.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.730
So that's the only thing that it does
that is different from a normal load.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.490
The store instruction that we
will use to implement the right

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.760
part of the atomic read/write operation
is called a store conditional.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.930
What it does is to check first
if the address that it computes

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.890
is the same as the one
in the link register.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.680
If the address is the same, then it does
a normal store to that memory location,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.140
and returns a 1 in it's register.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.110
If the address that the store computes
is not the same as the one in the link

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.890
register, then it just returns 0 in the
the register without storing anything.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.330
These two are behaving like
a single atomic operation

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.860
because of the link register.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.370
So let's see in more
detail how that works.
