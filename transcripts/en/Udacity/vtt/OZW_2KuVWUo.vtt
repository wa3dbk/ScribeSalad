00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Breaking means to apply friction, lots of it, and for breaking it's vital to distinguish

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
between two different regimes of friction--static friction and kinetic friction.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If this object is at rest with respect to that surface, we can apply forces up to a certain threshold force

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
without setting this object in motion, which remains static.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Experiments showed that this threshold of force is a constant times the rate force,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which often is called N because it's a normal force.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It is perpendicular to the surface. Its coefficient is called the coefficient of static friction µs.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
As long as the force that we apply doesn't exceed this force, this object won't be set in motion.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
When this force becomes larger than the threshold, the object will be set in motion.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
For example, if the mass of this object is 1 kg, the gravitational force would be almost 10 N.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
A pretty high value for this coefficient of static friction would be 1,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which means that the threshold force is at 1  10 N.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It would have to exert a force of 10 N or more to set this object in motion.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If we apply less, it remains static.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Typically, this coefficient of static friction ranges between 1/3 and 1, which means that typically

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to set an object in motion, we need to apply less force sideways than the force with which

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
gravity pulls that object down.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Things are easier in the kinetic regime.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We need to apply a certain force to keep this object going at a constant velocity.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So this force is nothing else but the force exerted by friction, and from experiments,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we find that this force is some constant times the normal force,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the force exerted by gravity in this case, and this is the coefficient for kinetic friction.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
In the kinetic regime, we got the same expression but it's an equal sign.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
In this case it's not a threshold--we compute the force as such.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
What's of imminent importance for breaking is that the coefficient of static friction tends to be

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
larger than the coefficient of kinetic friction.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The coefficient of kinetic friction maybe be 1/4 less than the coefficient of static friction

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
or it may even be smaller, and now think about breaking.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We want to apply the maximum amount of friction.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The maximum amount of friction is found in this static regime,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
because the coefficient of static friction is higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
What we need to prevent is the locking of wheels.

00:02:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
When wheel stays locked, it's sliding on the ground, and we're in the regime of kinetic friction.
