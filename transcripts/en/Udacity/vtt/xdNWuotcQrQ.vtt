00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.250
You've just seen how to implement the drive method so that it updates the gas

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.430
used. And there were two kinds of variables in that method. Let me show you.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.725
Over here, you see an instance variable. And inside the body of the drive

00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:18.080
method you see a different kind of variable called a local variable. What's the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.550
difference?
