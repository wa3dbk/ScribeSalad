00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.663
For the next question, this one looks a little different. I have the absolute

00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:09.200
value of 2x plus 3 equals negative 5. Now, I want you to think very carefully

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:13.687
about this one before you start trying to solve it. You can put your answer

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.973
here. If there's no solution you can put in ns for no solution. Good luck.
