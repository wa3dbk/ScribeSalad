00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.190
Wow.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.930
That's a lot of options.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.710
However, by making a list of
what we needed in a tool,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.490
one of them stands out for
our current purposes.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.570
InVision is the right tool for
us, right now.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.190
I want to delve a bit into
the strengths of the tool to make clear

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.030
why we're choosing to use it.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.140
First, I want to take
a look at interactivity.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.670
We've already mentioned this is key for
medium fidelity prototypes.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.730
And it turns out that inVision
has a concept of Hotspots,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.510
which maps directly onto our
concept of interaction points.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.270
To make our prototype interactive,
all we need to do is

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.250
take our list of interaction points and
make a hotspot for each of them.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.370
That bring us the speed.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.720
InVision allows you to
simply import your mocks or

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.590
wire frames into the tool,
which combines with that hotspot idea

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.470
to make building these
prototypes a very fast process.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.330
And then, it's main strength,
Remote Feedback is key to this tool.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.050
We'll talk more later about
what this looks like.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.030
But for now, all you need to know is
that inVision allows us to do user

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.000
research like we did with Carl, but
with someone half a world away.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.700
We can do that either in real
time with a LiveShare or

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.780
asynchronously with a Share Link.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.500
That's pretty great.
