00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.010
And again, that is probably very familiar to you by now.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.350
NP is is the complexity class of all problems that can

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.180
that can be solved in polynomial time

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.370
or in non-deterministic RAM.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.370
That's what the N here stands for; now you might have found this

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.460
quiz rather easy, but actually that you're so familiar with P and NP

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.100
I think it's something special,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.760
because I find that not many people actually understand what

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.870
P and NP stand for, and what the difference is between the two.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.840
Now if you really want to impress a theoretical computer scientist,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.050
of course you have to be a little bit nit picky.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.119
First of all, P and NP formally are

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.070
defined for decision problems,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.800
so here we said all problems, but actually,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.700
if you're very formal, it's only for decision problems,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.460
and the other thing is that

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.030
originally, those classes were not defined on the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.540
RAM but rather on a computer model

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.320
known as a Turing machine,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.510
named after the computer pioneer, Alan Turing.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.940
Now having a precise definition doesn't really change anything about P and NP

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.990
the way that we were talking about it,

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.730
but when you get down into the details of these classes,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.220
it might actually matter that you have a Turing machine here

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.770
instead of a RAM and that you're talking about decision problems

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.750
instead of optimization problems.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.900
But for here, I think it's just fine to think of it as the

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.820
complexity class of all problems

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.540
that can be solved in polynomial time

00:01:14.540 --> 99:59:59.000
on a deterministic or non deterministic RAM.
