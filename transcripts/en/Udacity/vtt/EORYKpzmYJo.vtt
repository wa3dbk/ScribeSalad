00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.600
Let's take a closer look at the methods
we'll use in the My Favorite Movies app.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.050
Here's the documentation for
the movie database.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.600
I've posted a link to this
documentation in the instructor notes.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.250
Scroll down a little
bit here on the left.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.505
This section on the right gives us
a list of all the methods provided

00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:17.105
by the API.

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:25.595
I'm going to select Account, and then
go to Account/ID/Favorite right here.

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:28.209
This is a method that we'll be
using in My Favorite Movies.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.750
As you might expect,
this method can be used to add or

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.930
remove movies from
an account's favorite list.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.810
You can see we have this information
about the required parameters,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.360
as well as this required
JSON body section.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.880
The JSON body,
also known as the HTTP body.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.350
Is part of an HTTP request that
allows us to pass parameters,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.340
without having to pass them in the URL,
like we've done before.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.000
We'll start using the JSON Body
when we make our first

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.070
post request later in this lesson.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.980
For now I want you to focus on
an extremely useful feature of the movie

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.780
database's documentation.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.470
If we click this post banner here,
a pane will slide out from the right.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.310
And in this pane,
we can take a look at example request.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.190
This is very much like the API
explorer that we saw with Flickr, so

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.170
let's scroll down a little bit.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.380
And it gives us this really
nice boilerplate code,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.740
that we can use to call each
of the methods in the API.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.590
So for this particular example,
we're calling HTTP,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.900
here's the url, for count id favorite.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.130
Notice it has id in red, because you'd
have to substitute in an id value for

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.140
the user id.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.350
But if we keep going down,
we can see in a share all session,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.290
these are some classes that we're
familiar with, and this is really nice.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.980
If we continue to scroll to the bottom,
we can see an example response.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.480
And for this particular method,
the response returns a status code and

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.990
a stats message, and

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.650
if it's successful, it says, the item
slash record was updated successfully.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.550
Before you get started,
I highly recommend just taking

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.740
some time with the documentation, and
clicking some of the other methods and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.260
taking a look at their
example responses.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.030
And their example boilerplate code here,
to actually make the network request.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.729
If we look back at the required
parameters section,

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.430
we see this parameter called session_id.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.060
What's this parameter all about?

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.390
Well, if you do some digging,
you'll find that The Movie Database uses

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.020
sessions whenever we want to
write data using the API.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.580
And by write, I'm referring
to the methods that update or

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.630
change data that's stored
in the movie database.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.420
So this would include methods like,
account ID favorite,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.550
where we're changing
an account's favorite list.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.690
It might also include methods for
rating a movie.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.950
There's some separate
documentation about sessions,

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.650
that's located on the movie database's
main website that I'm looking at now.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.690
I'll post a link for
this in the instructor notes as well.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.382
This page details how to create and
use a session,

00:02:50.382 --> 00:02:52.739
and it's associated session id.

00:02:56.477 --> 00:02:58.109
Without reading the entire page,

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.080
we see that the basic work flow requires
us to create a new request token.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.520
And then we can either do Step 2a or
Step 2b.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.050
Step 2a says,
ask the user permission via the website.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.190
Or we can the user permission via
the API, and then in Step three we

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.210
create that session ID that we
just saw in the documentation.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.900
Now, you'll for

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.370
Step two, we do have these two different
ways of asking the user for permission.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.760
One uses the website.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.690
And one uses the API.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.270
In this lesson, we're going to use Step
2b, and we're going to ask the user for

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.350
permission via the API.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.670
And then in the next lesson
we're going to ask the user for

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.890
permission via the website.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.100
So you'll get to look
at both approaches.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.400
Now if you haven't already,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.090
I highly encourage you to go through
this page and read it yourself.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.510
And some of the terms might
not make sense yet, but

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.120
start building a mental picture of
the steps required to create a session.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.450
because a session's what we're going to
need to make our first post request, and

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.020
actually favorite movies right?

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.240
The My Favorite Movies App.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.390
So we'll need to be able to do that.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.020
Before we go on,
let's talk to Travis and

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.670
see what he has to say about
authentication and the movie database.
