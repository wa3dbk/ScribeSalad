00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So there's always some software under test.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And this might be something huge like the Linux kernel,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
it might be something really small like a new square root function that we wrote,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but, in any case, what we want to be able to do 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is draw a box around the software that we're testing.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In general, the reason that we implemented the software

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is to provide some sort of a service that we're going to use in other software

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that we're going to provide to a user.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And what that means is the software under test is providing some set of APIs--

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that just stands for application programming interfaces--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and all this means is the software under test is going to provide a set of function calls

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that can be called by other software.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And of course, that's what we want to be testing.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So for the next little while, let's assume a really simple piece of software under test.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's assume that it's just a square root routine that we have implemented,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and we want to make sure that it works.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So to test this code, all we're going to need to do is pass values into the software--

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
so here we're calling square root routine with 9 as an input--and see what it returns,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
see if it returns the thing that we expected.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Let's just take a quick quiz here.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If I call a square root routine--and here let's assume 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that we're not talking about the Python square root; 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we're just talking about a general square root function

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that we're implementing for some hypothetical piece of software.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So we invoke the square root routine with 9. And what should it return?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Here we're going to make a multiple choice exam,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and you should enter into the text box all of the answers that apply.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So answer a) is 3, answer b) is -3. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Go ahead and please write your answer in the text box.
