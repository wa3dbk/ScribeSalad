00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.530
The solution to this problem is to

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.610
construct what's called a Spanning Tree, which is

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.410
a loop-free typology that covers every node in

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.310
the graph. The set of edges, shown in

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.030
blue, constitutes what's known as a Spanning

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.720
Tree. The collection of edges in the blue

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.740
typology covers every node in the underlying physical

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.990
typology. And yet, there are no loops in

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.690
the blue topology. Now, instead of flooding a

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.670
frame, a switch in this topology would simply forward

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.670
packets along the spanning tree. So for example,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.120
this switch would only send a frame along the

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.670
port corresponding to the blue edge. And would

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.200
not forward the frame out any edges that were

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.560
not part of the spanning tree. Other switches

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.250
that receive the frame, would flood in the same

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.940
fashion, along all edges that were part of the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.580
spanning tree. While omitting edges that were not members of

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.430
the spanning tree. Let's take a look at how

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.210
to construct the spanning tree. First the collection of switches

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.930
must elect a root, since every tree must have

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.660
a root. Typically this is the switch with the smallest

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.050
ID. In this case, the switch at the top

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.640
of the topology is the root. Then each switch must

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.120
decide which of its links to include in the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.110
spanning tree. And it excludes any link if that link

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.310
is determined to be not on the shortest path

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.510
to the root. For example, let's consider the switch in

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.720
the lower right. It has three lengths, this length

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.090
takes it on a path that's three hops from the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.590
root. This length takes it on a path that's two

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.640
hops to the root, and this length takes it on

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.250
a path, that's one hop to the root. Any link

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.190
that's not on a shortest path to the route is excluded

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.820
and any link that's on a shortest path on a route

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.020
is included. Simarly here, this edge is on a path that's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.290
one hop away from the route and this edge is

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.650
on a path that's two hops away. So this node will

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.200
include this link from the spanning tree. Now, each switch repeats

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.610
this process to exclude links from the underlying topology. And ultimately,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.729
this yields a [UNKNOWN] topology that looks like the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.790
blue Graph. And of course there is an issue which

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.460
is how do we determine the root in the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.160
first place? Well initially, every node think it's the root.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.870
And the switches run an election process to determine

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.280
which switch has the smallest ID. And if they learn

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.630
of a switch with a smaller ID, they update their

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.670
view of the root, and they compute the distance to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.750
the new root. Whenever a switch updates its view of the root,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.090
it also determines how far it is from that root. So that when

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.740
other neighboring nodes receive those updates. They can determine their distance

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.440
to the new root simply by adding one to any message that they receive.
