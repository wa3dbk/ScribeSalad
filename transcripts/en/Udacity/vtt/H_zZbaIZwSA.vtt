00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.040
Here you can see Hierarchy Viewer,
let's you select from a list of devices

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.080
both physical and virtual on the left,

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.350
each of which then contains,
each of the running activities

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.150
and applications running on that device.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.400
You simply select the activity 
from the application

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.120
that you want to profile.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.150
Then the LoadView Hierarchy button here,
and you'll see a representation

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.020
of the selected activity's 
entire View hierarchy

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.720
represented here in the TreeView,
from left to right.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.110
You can see that the entire hierarchy
is also show here, in the overview,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.780
and the layout itself 
is shown in a wireframe here.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.293
Clicking on any view, 
at any point within the hierarchy,

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:35.096
will show you what is displayed,

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:37.699
showing us the number of Views 
which are contained within the hierarchy

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.766
from this point onwards.

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.863
You can also obtain
the performance metrics

00:00:41.863 --> 00:00:44.500
to find out how long it takes 
to measure, layout and draw

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.650
each element of the hierarchy.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.410
It's a powerful tool, and you can
find out more about how to use it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.880
to optimize your layouts and Views
in the videos and guides

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.140
linked to from the instructor notes below.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.490
For now, note that we can use it 
to find surprisingly deeply nested layouts

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.984
that need to be flattened.

00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:02.116
For example, here we have
a layout we can describe

00:01:02.116 --> 00:01:03.900
using one of two techniques.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.590
One solution is using 
two nested LinearLayouts.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.716
But a better solution would be
using a RelativeLayout.

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:13.280
The RelativeLayout is one level shallower.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.660
Another tip is to avoid using
the FrameLayout as the root for layout

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.620
that will always be inserted 
as a child into another one.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.570
In these circumstances, the merge tag
is a better alternative.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.040
This will be eliminated when the layout 
is included into the parents' hierarchy.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.050
To help you remember
all of these tips and tips,

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.270
Android has a powerful
static analysis tool called Lint.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.960
As you can see here in the Lint window,
in addition to the layout warnings

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.990
we've already talked about, 
it also checks from everything

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.833
from accessibility problems, 
missing translations,

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.136
and hard coded strings.

00:01:42.136 --> 00:01:45.680
You can find all the things lint checks for
at the developer tools page

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.510
linked to in the instructor notes.
