00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.936
Hi, welcome back to the show. Let's walk through the solution for this one

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:06.214
because it's just a little bit tricky. First, we need to keep some sort of

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:09.553
count on how many of the assets have been loaded and how many we're waiting to

00:00:09.553 --> 00:00:13.722
load. To do this, we create a nifty little object here, that has a count that

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:16.758
represents how many objects have been loaded, a total which is how many objects

00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:21.545
we're waiting to load, and then the given call back function. Now we want to

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:24.425
take our code, which previously only loaded one asset and issued a call back,

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:29.030
and add loop around it so that we can do this for the entire asset list. Now,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.229
there's one tricky thing here, is that once we actually load an object and get

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.330
a call back function for it, we want to do some logic before we issue the call

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.362
back. So for instance once the first image is loaded, we don't want to issue

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:42.991
the call back then, we want to wait until the entire set has been loaded. For

00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:46.550
this, we added the new function called onLoadedCallback. This function, given

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.520
an asset that's been loaded, will actually go through and increase the count on

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.479
the batch. Once our count equals that total number of assets we're waiting for,

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.282
we actually issue the callback at that time. With this setup, you have the

00:00:57.282 --> 00:01:00.114
ability to issue a batch of assets, load them, and when they've all been

00:01:00.114 --> 00:01:02.961
loaded, you finally get your callback.
