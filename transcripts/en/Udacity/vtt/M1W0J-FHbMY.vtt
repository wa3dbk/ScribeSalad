00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.360
Health information exchange is essential
for care coordination, managing

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.990
populations of patients, public health
and aggregating data for research.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.510
However, there are still many challenges
that have proven hard to overcome,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.910
despite years of effort.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.740
Perhaps most importantly, it's difficult
to establish a sustainable business

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.720
model beyond the confines
of a healthcare enterprise,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.080
which has its own proprietary business
reasons for supporting an HIE.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.480
There's also the inevitable trade-off
between functionality and cost.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.380
Centralized models like IHIE deal
with data interoperability issues and

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.000
can provide extensive services,
but at a high cost.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.140
New virtually free models, like Direct,
are not yet providing services

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.100
nearly as rich as IHIE, but we've
discussed how that might be changing.
