One solution is to replace the last line of the fragment shader with this line

00:00:03.512 --> 00:00:07.804
of code. The order of the values is red, green and blue. An alternate solution

00:00:07.804 --> 00:00:10.748
is to set each of these individually, either solution is fine, you could even

00:00:10.748 --> 00:00:13.554
use x, y, z, w for the coordinate names, the shading language interpreter

00:00:13.554 --> 00:00:18.830
doesn't care. I wanted to show this colorful multivariable way of debugging.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.260
And it's sometimes handy for seeing correlations between parameters. In

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.410
practice though, it's usually clear to copy just a single value to all three

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.000
color channels.
