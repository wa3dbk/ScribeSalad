If you got this answer, excellent work. Here I've gone ahead and drawn the like

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:08.816
terms in shapes. The p to the 4ths have a green square, and the p squareds have

00:00:08.816 --> 00:00:13.209
circles in a lighter color. I also drew triple lines under the constants. I'm

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.494
showing you this as a method of finding the like terms. Use whatever you feel

00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:22.345
comfortable doing. These are just tools to help you out. I've rearranged the

00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:27.264
like terms in this second line. Notice I paid careful attention to keep the sign

00:00:27.264 --> 00:00:32.095
with its term. If it's positive the sign is positive. And if it's negative, the

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:36.945
sign in front of the term still stays negative. Finally, adding our like terms

00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:38.845
together, we get this result.
