00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.320
But before we get started, how do we
go about building our web application?

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.900
For many people, the most natural way
of going about a project is to just

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.980
dive into it head first, writing as much
code as possible before falling asleep.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.790
While this method feels fast,
many times we end up spending more

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.530
time fixing bugs and examining code than
actually developing our application.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.150
Another option is to code in pieces,
working on one page here,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.280
another feature there, and
putting everything together at the end.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.150
While this approach is a little more
organized, we may stumble across

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
several bugs when it's time to
integrate all of our code together.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.070
Also, we won't have a working
prototype until we're finished with

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.430
the entire project.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.610
But what if we took another approach,
starting out really simple and

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.690
layering on complexity as we go?

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.920
Not adding a new feature until
we finish the one before.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.320
With each feature, we stop, test, debug,
and share to make sure we always have

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.410
a working application even if it's
very basic in the initial stages.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.720
This way, anyone involved in
the creation of our product, such as

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.270
clients, managers, and team members,
always know what the project status is,

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.100
and what enhancements
are soon to follow.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.330
This process is called
iterative development.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.790
Iterative development allows
developers to code in an agile way.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.030
What agile means is that since there
is always a working prototype,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.100
if a client or teammate asks for
changes, as a developer,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.850
you can react to that feedback quickly
without tripping up the entire process.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.940
In this last lesson, you will plan,
organize, and execute development

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.100
iteratively to create a final
polished restaurant menu application
