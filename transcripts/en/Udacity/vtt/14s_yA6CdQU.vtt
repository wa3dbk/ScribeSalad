00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.260
Recall we discussed that public key
encryption is typically used to

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.470
establish a symmetric key for encrypting
messages for say between Alice and Bob.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.050
That is, before Alice and
Bob can communicate securely

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.950
they would use public key's encryption
to exchange a sure and secret key.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.820
Of course, Alice and
Bob can first establish this key

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.350
before Alice can send Bob the first
message encrypted using this key.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.900
But with Public Key Encryption we can
do better, meaning that we can do

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.600
it in a more efficient way with so
called digital envelopes.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.500
Alice can send Bob a message encrypted
using a share key that she just created,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.340
and this share secret key itself is
encrypted using Bob's public key, so

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.710
that only Bob can decrypt and
extract the share secret key.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.400
This is similar to the situation where

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.910
only the intended recipient
can open the sealed envelope.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.050
To illustrate,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.480
Alice first creates a symmetric key
that she wants to share with Bob.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.019
She can encrypt a message
using this share key,

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.480
then she also uses Bob's public
key to encrypt this share key.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.980
And then she can put
the encrypted message and

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.780
the encrypted key in envelope.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.180
Then she can put the encrypted message
and the encrypted key together and

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.810
send them to Bob.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.390
On the receiving end,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.270
Bob can use his private key to
decrypt the encrypted share key.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.990
Once he gets a shared key, he can now
decrypt the encrypted message and

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.970
get a plain text message.
