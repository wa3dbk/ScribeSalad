00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.109
In the previous unit, we've worried about two object references that pointed to

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:07.802
different objects. Now we're going to look at a different situation, when

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:12.182
object reference doesn't point anywhere at all. Let me explain that. Over here,

00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:15.719
you have a situation with which you are very familiar. We have a variable that

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.068
references an object,

00:00:17.068 --> 00:00:17.849
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.810
cat. Now, my favorite cat is in fact my cat, Eliza. But maybe Sarah doesn't

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.194
like cats and her favorite wouldn't be any cat at all. That is in the variable

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:32.490
her favorite, there wouldn't be any reference to any cat object. In Java, she

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.944
denote such a reference to no object at all with the keyword null. So this

00:00:37.944 --> 00:00:43.164
variable here holds this special null reference. This variable here holds a

00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:48.341
reference to some cat object. Generally, you would use this distinction meaning

00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:52.495
either a reference to a specific object or a null reference if the object is

00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:59.470
optional to test whether a variable is null or not. You use equal, equal and

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.662
you test, is this reference the null reference? Now, if there is a chance that

00:01:04.662 --> 00:01:09.090
a object contains null. It actually is important that you make that test.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.640
Because if you invoke a method on a null reference, then something bad happens

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.622
and the method called blows up. Well, it doesn't really blow up, of course. But

00:01:18.622 --> 00:01:23.480
it does terminate your program with a null pointer exception. It is simply

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.010
illegal to call any method on null, don't do it. Instead, make this test first.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.487
I've prepared a little quiz here, where I'm going to ask you about several

00:01:33.487 --> 00:01:38.100
kinds of tests. So here's the situation, our intrepid reporter went to city

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.651
hall to get a statement from the mayor. And now I'd like you to give me the

00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:47.196
java code to test whether the statement was one of the following. Did the mayor

00:01:47.196 --> 00:01:51.436
say no comment? Just type in here, what you would put inside the parentheses of

00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:56.278
an if statement to check for that a couple more. Did the mayor say nothing at

00:01:56.278 --> 00:02:01.120
all? And finally, did the reporter not manage to get a statement? Maybe he was

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.640
stuck in traffic. So, just type in the conditions for each one of them.
