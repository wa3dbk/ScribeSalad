00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
One of the standard problems that people study in statistics has to do with purchasing decisions.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Suppose you wish to buy a house.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There are small houses and big houses, but you really like this one special house

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
build by a famous designer.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This house has a certain price.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Say in US dollars it's $92,000.00.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The question you'd like to ask yourself--is this okay?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Is it too much--you should pay less--or too little?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Let's go an find out.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In statistics, the way we find out is by looking at data.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's assume there is a database of previous house sales

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of homes in the same neighborhood.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Just for simplicity, let's assume we know about two things--

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the size of the home and the cost at which it was sold.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There is a house with 1400 square feet that sold at $112,000,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
a much larger one with 2400 square feet sold for $192,000,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and so on for an entire number of other houses.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now it's a statistics problem.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You have past data, and here is your very first quiz.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Say the house you wish to purchase has 1300 square feet in size.

00:01:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
How much money should you expect to pay?
