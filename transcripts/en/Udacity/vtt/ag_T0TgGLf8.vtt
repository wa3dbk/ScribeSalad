00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.710
Intrusion Detection Systems, or IDS for

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.730
short, are designed to counter
these types of threats.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.210
They can be quite
effective against known or

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.120
less sophisticated attacks, such as
large scale email phishing attacks.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.820
However, as attack techniques
become more sophisticated,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.260
IDS will become less effective.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.590
For example, attackers can blend attack
traffic with normal activities so

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.820
that it is very hard to
detect such attacks.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.009
And the most sophisticated attackers,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.355
in particular, the state-sponsored
attackers, may use new or

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:40.360
zero-day exploits to render
IDS completely ineffective.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.510
Since IDS are not always effective,
they need to be part of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.430
the defense-in-depth strategy for
an organization.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.110
Typical defense-in-depth
strategies should include

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.560
encrypting sensitive information,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.720
provide detail of the trails of
activities on systems and networks.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.060
Use strong authentication and
access control.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.390
Actively manage the security of
operating system and applications.
