00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.719
So, how useful is active network? There

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:04.880
are lots of potential applications that can be

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.910
built using this active network's paradigm. In

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.390
particular, what we want to do is, when

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.080
ever we desire certain ways to visualize

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.470
the behavior of the network. Then active networks

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.060
become very useful. So, for instance, for

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.760
implementing protocol independent multicast reliable multicast, or noticing

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.310
congestions in the network and notifying the source

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.316
and the destination about the congestions, private IP, any

00:00:32.316 --> 00:00:34.220
casting. These are all the kinds of things

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.670
that are useful to implement using active networks. And

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.920
as you can see from this list, the kinds of things that you want to do, using

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.070
active networks, are things that are related to network

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.170
functionality. Not high-level application,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.590
but network functionality. In particular,

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.770
it is useful for building applications that are difficult to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.230
deploy in the internet. So, when you rely on the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.810
routing and the internet, it is entirely an administrative set

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.819
up, and the administrative set up tends to mirror the

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.610
physical set up. But, for your particular network flow, you

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.900
may want a set up that is different from the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260
physical set up. And the example I give you of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.970
me sending a greeting that will be a single message

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.370
for most of the traverse through the internet,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.720
but at some point, it may actually get demultiplexed

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.470
and get sent to several different destinations. Those

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.410
kinds of multicasting and things like that, are specific

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.270
to network flow. So, we are in some

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.190
sense, overlaying our own desire on topology, on top

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.000
of the physical topography of the internet, by using

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.080
the active network paradigm. But, the key properties that

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.910
you want to have for applications that you want

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.970
to build using the active networks paradigm, is that

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.700
the applications should be expressible and it should be

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.660
compact and it should be fast and it should not

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.240
rely on all the notes being active. These are

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.230
key things to note in building applications that live on

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.580
top of the active networks. So all of these

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.310
suggest, once again, what I said already and that is,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.160
it is for providing network layer functionality,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.550
not end application functionality. So, what you want

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.740
in the network layer, that is something

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.990
that again orchestrate using the active networks paradigm.
