00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
To see if the problem that Alice is working on where it takes cover has any relation

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.120
to either clique or independent set, the first thing that we could do is just take the graphs

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.020
where we previously solve clique and independent set on and find vertex covers for that.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.740
This is kind of a double quiz because I would like you to figure out the size of

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.600
the smallest possible vertex cover for both this graph here and this graph over here.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.050
Please enter your answer for this graph over here in this box

00:00:31.050 --> 99:59:59.000
and your answer for this graph here in this box.
