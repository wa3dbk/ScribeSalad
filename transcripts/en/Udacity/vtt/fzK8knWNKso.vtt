00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.400
These are the factored forms. Great work for getting at least half of these

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.342
right. If you really struggled with these, I would go back and review

00:00:06.342 --> 00:00:10.220
factoring. Try and get in some more practice before moving on. If you only

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.460
missed one or two, then see if you could find your mistakes by looking at your

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.380
factors. If you can't find your mistakes, then continue watching the solution

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.914
to see where your reasoning went wrong. The greatest common factor for these

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:24.980
three terms is one. So let's use factoring by grouping to get our two factors.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.169
We want factors of negative 30 that sum to negative 1. The factors are negative

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.818
6 and positive 5. Then we can use factoring by grouping to get the factors of

00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:40.360
3x plus 1 and 5x minus 2, this is our first numerator. For the denominator, we

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.675
want to find factors of negative 20, that's sum deposit of 8. The factors would

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:48.702
be positive 10 and negative 2. We use factoring by grouping to get our

00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:53.456
denominator of 2x plus 5 times 2x minus 1, here. Next, we factor this

00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:57.676
trinomial. The greatest common factor for each term is one, so we need to find

00:00:57.676 --> 00:01:02.454
factors of negative 60 that sum to negative 7. We don't need to factor out a g

00:01:02.454 --> 00:01:06.833
c f. These two factors are negative 12 and positive 5. They might have been

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:12.150
tough to find. We use factoring by grouping to get 2 x plus 5 times x minus 6.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.600
And this is what we put in our numerator. For our second denominator, we want

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.416
to find factors of negative 30 that sum to positive 13. We use factors by

00:01:20.416 --> 00:01:25.320
grouping to get our factors of x plus 3 and 5x minus 2. And now we're done

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.653
factoring, and we're ready to simplify.
