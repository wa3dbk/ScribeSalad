00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.240
In the previous lesson, we learned some tricks we can employ as operating

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.550
system designers for optimizing the RPC communication

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.840
software which powers client-server communication in the

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.870
local area network from the point of

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.290
view of reducing communication latency. Of course,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.290
user interactions go beyond the local area

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.570
network to the wide area Internet. The

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.620
primary issue, once a packet leaves your

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.860
local node, is to route the packet reliably

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.700
and quickly to the destination. Routing is part

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.080
of the functionality of the network layer of

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.440
the protocol stack of an operating system.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.425
What happens to a packet once it leaves

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:48.340
your node? Well, the intermediate hardware routers between

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.090
your node and the destination have routing tables.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.750
That help them to move the packet towards the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.410
desired destination node by doing a table look-up. The

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.090
routing tables evolve over time, since the Internet itself

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.420
is evolving continually. That's the big picture. And there are

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.180
lots of fascinating details which you can learn in

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.120
a course that is dedicated to computer networking. For

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.660
the next part of the lesson on distributed systems,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.040
we want to ask the question, what can be done

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.870
in the intermediate routers, to accommodate the quality

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.420
of service needs of individual packet flows through

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.380
the network? Or in other words, can we

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.840
make the routers en route to the destinations smart?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.080
The specific thought experiment we are going to

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.320
discuss is called active networks. And then, we

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.090
will connect the dots from active networks to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.150
the current state of the art, which is referred

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.040
to as software defined networking. Thus far

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.350
in the course, we've been focusing on

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.690
specializing operating system services for a single

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.670
processor, or a multi-core or a parallel system,

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.470
or a local area network. In this lesson, we will take this idea of specializing

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.800
to the the wide area network. Specifically, we will study the idea of providing

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.440
quality of service for network communication in

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.820
an operating system by making the network active.
