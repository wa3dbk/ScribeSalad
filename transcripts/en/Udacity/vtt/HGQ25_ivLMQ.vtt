00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.080
The key to D3's magic is in the selection before the data binding,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.350
the data binding itself, and the selection after the data has been bound,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.560
in this case the .enter selection, which is actually a very special type

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.760
of select which we then eventually add shapes or

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.230
circles, SVG, or HTML to our page for every element in this enter selection.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.090
Many tutorials out there gloss over this detail of what exactly is the enter,

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.410
at least to start off.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.240
But I think once you have a solid understanding of the data join,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.550
these selections that come after data join, much of the rest of the library,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.410
d3 that is, and the complexities involved with adding interaction and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.972
animation to your graphic fall into place quite nicely.

00:00:50.972 --> 00:00:56.480
Mike Bostock, the creator of d3, has one of the best posts on the subject,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.670
not surprisingly, and it's titled Thinking with Joins.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.720
I'll take a short diversion to explain what a join actually is and

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.830
what it means in the context of d3.
