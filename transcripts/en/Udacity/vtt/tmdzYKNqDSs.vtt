00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.628
To plot the means and study the medians for each of the

00:00:02.628 --> 00:00:06.330
cohorts, we just need to change our fun.y parameter. This needs to

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.220
be mean instead. Now, to get the grand mean, we just add

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.470
a geom line and then set the parameters. We'll have a stat

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.020
of summary. We'll set fun.y to equal the mean, and then we'll

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.530
set the line type equal to two. Here, I'm using two so

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.730
that way, I get a dash line so it stands out in

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.500
comparison to these others. Plotting the grand mean is a good reminder

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.550
that much of the data in the sample is about members of recent cohorts. This is

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.800
the type of more high level observation that

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.360
you want to make as you explore data.
