Let me do the same quiz again.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now we have two landmarks,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the picture I'm giving you is a robot with three total positions.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There's a landmark here and a landmark here,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and say this landmark is being seen in these two positions,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and this landmark these two poses, but landmark L1 is not seen at x2,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and landmark L2 is not seen at x0.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Of the 30 fields over here how many of them will never be touched?

00:00:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please put your answer over here.
