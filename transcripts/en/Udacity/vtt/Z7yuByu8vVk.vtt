00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.438
This expression is the odd one out. The other ones equal positive 1. This

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:08.143
expression equals 1 since we have the same expression in the numerator and the

00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:11.996
denominator. We've seen something similar like this before if we just switch the

00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:15.692
terms in the denominator we can see that numerator and the denominator have the

00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:20.224
same factors. Notice that I'm not cancelling an individual term. I'm cancelling

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:25.256
an entire numerator with an entire denominator. So I have one divided by one or

00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:29.048
just one. This one might have been a little bit tricky. Here we have a negative

00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:33.595
one times our rational expression. Well we can just distribute this negative

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:38.330
sign or this negative one to each term and the numerator. This would give us x

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.559
plus 3 Divided by 3 plus x. This fraction is identical to this rational

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.810
expression, so we know it equals 1. For this rational expression, we know that

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.685
these factors can reduce to 1, but we're left with a negative sign out in front,

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:56.774
or a negative 1 times 1, which is just negative 1.
