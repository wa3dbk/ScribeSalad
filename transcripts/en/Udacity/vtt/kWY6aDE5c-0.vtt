That's sustained attention. We have the ability to focus our attention on a

task, or a target for an extended period of time. Now, this can be really

difficult to do, but a lot of jobs require it. For example surgeons, truck

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:21.690
drivers, or pilots have to be able to focus for an extended period of time.
