00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.855
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So the two numbers that we're going to need to help us with factoring add to

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:08.076
equal this middle coefficient but multiply to equal the product of the two outer

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:12.213
coefficients. Now I wonder if this works if we don't have an expression just

00:00:12.213 --> 00:00:16.419
like this, where the coefficient out here is 1, in front of the x squared term.

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:21.110
Let's say we have something different. Maybe we have 8x squared plus 26x plus

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.046
15. Of course, the important thing here is that 8 is not 1. So our coefficient

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:30.986
in front of the x squared term is different this time than what we've dealt with

00:00:30.986 --> 00:00:35.923
before. The question I have for you then is, what are the numbers n and m for

00:00:35.923 --> 00:00:41.861
this expression right here? What two numbers add to equal 26 and multiply to

00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:43.325
equal 8 times 15?
