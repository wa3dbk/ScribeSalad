00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720
So given that the greedy algorithm takes 57 instead of 24, what's the approximation factor

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.490
for this concrete example here where the approximation constant?

00:00:11.490 --> 99:59:59.000
And I would like to enter your answer here and please give me 2 digits after the decimal.
