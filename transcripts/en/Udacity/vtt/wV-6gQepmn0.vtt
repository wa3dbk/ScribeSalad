00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.300
They're our Klout scores. So first let's calculate the mean. Push Cmd down arrow

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.632
key and then you see that there are 1,048 values. And make sure we don't have a

00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:20.628
header row, which we don't. So we know that n is 1,048. So anywhere really, we

00:00:20.628 --> 00:00:29.930
can write equals, average, A1, colon A1048. So we get that the mean is 37.72

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:37.257
approximately. Let's calculate the standard deviation. We calculated our mean in

00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:50.632
cell D1048. Cell rate in cell B1, equals A1 minus $D $1048, which keeps the

00:00:50.632 --> 00:01:01.776
value in cell D1048 constant. Okay, the we'll go to cell B1 hit Cmd+C to copy

00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:10.760
it, go to cell A1, Cmd down arrow key go to cell B1048, Cmd+Shift up arrow key.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.976
So all of column B is highlighted, Cmd+B. Now we have all our deviations. And

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:25.124
actually what we could do is instead, we can just calculate the square

00:01:25.124 --> 00:01:33.410
deviations. So let's put parenthesis around the deviation and then square it.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.957
Now let's copy this and paste it. Now we have all our squared deviations in

00:01:40.957 --> 00:01:49.120
column B. So we calculate the variance by taking the average of this, equals

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:59.083
average B1:B1048. So that's our variance and then our standard deviation is the

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:04.145
square root, equals square root of D1.
