00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.910
So we're going to try a few things in the Python interpreter

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.790
to get a sense of how long things take and I've

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.730
written in a procedure here that times the execution of a

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.840
piece of code. Right, we could just do the timing with

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.800
a stopwatch and then we'd have to run really long things

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.420
to be able to get a, a reasonably accurate time but

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.810
Python has a built in procedure we can use to measure

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.620
time, and that's the time clock procedure. So we could try just

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.740
using a stop watch and if we ran programs

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.030
that took long enough to run, this would give us

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.540
a reasonable idea of how long they took. It's going to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.760
be a lot more accurate to use this built in

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.250
procedure, which is provided by the time library that evaluates

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.700
to the number of seconds. So the value of time.clock

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.390
will give us the current processor time in seconds. This

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.740
starting point is fairly arbitrary there but the important thing

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.390
is if we call it twice, and we start the

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.120
time here, and we stop the time at the second

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.460
call, we store those in the variables, start and stop,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.650
that's going to give us the amount of time it took

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.670
to execute this code. So I've rendered a procedure that

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.630
starts by initializing the variable start to the current clock

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.420
time then run some code, and I'll talk more about

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.925
what it's doing there in a second, and then it computes

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:18.900
the time between the current time and the start

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.430
time, and gives us the run time, and it returns

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.880
both the results of the code and the time it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.080
took to run. What's happening here is actually quite exciting.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.520
So we're using Eval. Eval allows us to evaluate

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.130
any string as if it were a python expression, so

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.350
we're passing in a string here but when we're passing

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.460
the string in to eval, it's running it as code.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.160
So we can pass at any python expression. We're going to start

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.920
and end the timer and in between, we're going to evaluate the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.791
code and get the result of evaluating that code. So I've

00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:54.450
defined this procedure time execution that will give us the time

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.650
it takes to evaluate any Python expression. And now we're going to

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.080
run some tests and instead of running them through the web

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.940
browser IDE like you've been using so far, I'm going to run

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.980
them directly in the Python shell, running on my desktop computer, and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.110
the reason for that is we'll get more accurate timing measurements. You

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.955
can try running timing through the Web browser interface that we provide.

00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:16.630
The problem is there are limits to how long we let your

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.640
programs execute and the timings won't be very accurate so instead, I'm

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.700
going to run these in the Python shell, If you have Python installed,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.410
you can try this yourself, and we have some directions on the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.500
website how you can do that, but it's not necessary to do

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.270
that to continue in the class. I just wanted to demonstrate how

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.630
time execution works. So let's try a

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.800
simple example. We're going to time the execution

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.050
of the expression 1 plus 1. So that's doing a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.720
simple addition. We're adding two numbers. Well see how long

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.270
that takes and when we run time execution, we get

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.960
back two results. We get back the result which is

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.830
one plus one is two. That's good. And as the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.760
second result, we get the time it took. A little

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.060
hard to read so it looks like 8.3 and then

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.860
E to the negative 05. So what that means That's

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.450
using the scientific notation. The negative 05 is where the decimal point is so

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.170
what that is really looks like this. There are four zeros followed

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.200
by the 83 dot dot dot and that's a value in the number of seconds.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.082
For the number of seconds it took to run is .00008

00:03:26.082 --> 00:03:29.960
seconds. If we try the same thing again we'll

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.880
try timing the exact same thing. We don't get exactly the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.550
same result like the timing's inaccurate. It depends on other things

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.510
going on on the machine. We won't get exactly the same

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.540
answer. But it's still a very small number. And if we

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.230
try it a few times, we'll keep seeing this small number.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.970
If we try, a more complicated addition, it's still going to give

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.440
us a very small number, and it's a small number of

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.250
microseconds. The actual processor time for something that simple is actually

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.750
probably lower than that but there are some other things happening because

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.490
we needed to stop and start the clock and other things to

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.170
do the timing. We'll see more if we try running longer things.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.110
So this won't tell us much evaluating very simple, very fast evaluations.
