00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.836
Let's see how you did. The x intercept for this equation is 3, 0 and the y

00:00:05.836 --> 00:00:12.492
intercept is 0, negative 6. Let's see how we got those answers. Remember when we

00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:18.534
are finding an x intercept we set the y value to 0. When we set y equal to 0 in

00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:25.146
this equation we get. 2x minus 0 equals 6. Which is the same as 2x equals 6. And

00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:31.460
if we divide both sides by 2 we get x equals 3. So the x intercept is going to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.429
be 3 comma zero. To find the y intercept we want to set x equal to 0 in the

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:44.505
equation. When we put x equals 0 in this equation, we get. 2 times 0 minus y

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:53.493
equals 6. 2 times 0 is 0. So we have negative y equals 6. And, we can divide

00:00:53.493 --> 00:01:01.913
both sides by negative 1, which gives us y equals negative 6. So, the

00:01:01.913 --> 00:01:08.450
y-intercept is 0. -6. If you got the answer right, great work. If you didn't get

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.458
it right, don't worry, just go back and look at the video, and try again.
