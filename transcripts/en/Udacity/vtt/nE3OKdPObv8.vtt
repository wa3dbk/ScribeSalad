00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.660
There is one final step
that you need to consider

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.650
before this place picker integration
is complete, and that is attributions.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.650
When displaying data from the Google
places API for Android, such as

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.430
auto complete results or place name and
address, there is some attribution and

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.450
Google local requirements
that you must comply with.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.380
The requirements apply to
the Place Picker UI widget as well

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.420
any programmatic API calls.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.990
So if your app has retrieved
a place via the Place Picker and

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.910
then shows this data on a follow
up screen without a map,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.740
the app must also show attributions
on this follow up screen.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.260
So we have the Powered by Google image
included in the Google repository

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.420
in the correct sizes that you need for
Android apps.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.070
You can reference it directly by name
as Powered by Google and then light or

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.150
dark, depending on if you're
using a light background or

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.030
a dark one respectively.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.160
But note that this Powered by Google
resource is just an image, and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.269
therefore, this text
will not be localized.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.930
So, you can see our integration for
attributions in the GitHub

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.330
commit linked below, or you can feel
free to play with the layouts and

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.860
where you would want to
place an attribution image.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.600
There are also special
considerations for

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.500
attributions for
third party content, so be sure to

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.340
check the documentation linked in the
instructor notes for more information.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.780
And if you would like to see what
else the Play Safe has to offer,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.660
there's a link in the instructor
notes for you as well.
