00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.320
You've just built your first
Android App that renders Google Maps.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.460
You've learned how to create
a map fragment in the UI and

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.610
have that initialize Maps for you.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.810
You also learned the beginnings of how
to get and use the Google map object

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.740
to allow users to change the map
while the app is running.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.170
You've just begun to scratch the surface
of what's possible with Maps

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.410
in your Android apps.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.370
Are you ready for more?

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.880
Great.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.530
Let's go deeper.
