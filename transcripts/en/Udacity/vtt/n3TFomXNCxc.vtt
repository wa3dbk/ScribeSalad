00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.921
For two polynomial expressions to be opposites every corresponding pair of terms

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:10.058
must be opposite in sign. Knowing this, I want you to determine whether each of

00:00:10.058 --> 00:00:15.552
these rational expressions is equal to positive one, negative one or something

00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:19.570
else. Choose one of these for each expression. Good luck.
