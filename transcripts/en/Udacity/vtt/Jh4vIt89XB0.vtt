00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.750
Can you create a folder structure for the project?

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.700
Yes.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.260
You don't need to know anything about the framework in order to create the HTML

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.700
and CSS files that you'll later be writing.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.960
Can you create a DOM tree for the page?

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.690
Yes.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.150
Using the structure of the mock-up,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.040
you could pretty much figure out what the DOM tree should look like.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.990
Can you write HTML that defines the DOM?

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.920
Yes, you can.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.440
If you can figure out the DOM tree for

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.560
the page, you can start writing the HTML that will create it.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.750
Can you assign class names to HTML Elements?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.950
No you can't.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.800
Not until you have your frame work picked out.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.300
Each frame work will have its own custom classes.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.090
Can you write CSS?

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.870
Not quite.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.470
Not until you pick a framework.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.000
And can you test the page?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.300
Well if you don't have the CSS you're not going to be able to test it yet.
