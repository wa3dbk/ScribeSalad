00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.290
Okay. The last thing I want to talk about with regard

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.670
to update, is how to update multiple documents at once.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.170
There are many situations in which we want to do

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.440
some sort of global modification to all documents matching a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.480
certain set of criteria. So, here we selected a single

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.660
document, and updated its country code to DEU. And updated

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.940
it so that it included this country code. But this

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.770
is a country code, not a city code. And we

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.810
could go into why we would want to do this. This

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.700
is definitely a de-normalization of this data, if you're familiar with

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.730
that term. Essentially where we headed here with this example,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.260
is that the country code will be replicated in every single

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.920
document that represents the city in Germany. In Mongo DB,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.840
we design our document schemas so that they match the access

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.110
patterns. So that ideally, in order to satisfy any one query,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.970
you only have to hit the database once. Therefore the normalization

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.650
makes sense. It's a way of getting really hyper formats

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.410
and being able to scale really well, your database. Okay,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.790
pardon the slight digression, but I assume that for at

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.890
least a few of you, the normalized versus denormalized data

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.740
question was coming to mind. Okay, back to the topic

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.100
at hand. In this case, what I'd like to do,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.290
is use update to query for documents whose country is

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.330
Germany. And what I'd like to do is set the isoCountryCode

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.200
field for all such documents to this value. The way we do that using update,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.880
is by specifying a 3rd parameter, multi equals

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.920
true. Now by default again, update will modify

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.360
just the first document that it finds. So, in order to get it to modify

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.580
all documents matching this query, we need to

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.810
specify this parameter. Okay, so let's run this.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.870
Okay, and then, we can go back to the Mongo

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.840
shell and do a query. Now, this time, I need

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.830
to modify my query so that we're looking for all

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.930
cities with the country field of Germany. And because we want

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.010
them all, I need to change this back to a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.050
Find, instead FindOne. Right? And then I want to pretty

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.750
print these, and here we go. Here is Chemnitz, hope

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.080
I'm pronouncing that properly. And it has the correct I.S.O. code,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.910
and here we have another city, with the correct country

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.889
code and so on as we move through this data.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.320
Okay, so that's multiple update and of course we could

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.530
use other operators besides just set in this same way.
