00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:02.981
The first unit of CS212 uses poker as a vehicle to

00:00:02.981 --> 00:00:05.849
teach about the design of computer programs. If you

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:07.899
don’t know the rules of poker yet, don’t worry, that’s

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.452
exactly what this video is for. Now of all you know

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:12.527
about poker is what you’ve seen on TV or in a

00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:15.216
casino, you may think it’s pretty complicated. There

00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:17.932
is that intimidating green table and it’s surrounded

00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:21.129
by some very serious looking people and these

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:24.412
people often have very silly hats or ridiculous

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:30.613
sunglasses and they are saying things like, raise, or

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.765
all-in. Now if you ever want to actually play poker,

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:35.648
you are going to have to learn what all this means.

00:00:35.648 --> 00:00:37.340
There is betting, there is folding, there is calling,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.474
there is raising, and it can get pretty complicated.

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:42.445
There is a lot of strategy involved. But for the

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:45.442
purposes of this unit, we only need to know the most

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:48.396
basic aspect of poker and this aspect is common to

00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:52.099
every single variation of poker and that’s how hands

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:53.946
are arranged because at the end of the day, all of

00:00:53.946 --> 00:00:55.917
these different versions of poker have to do with

00:00:55.917 --> 00:00:58.451
making the best five card hand that you can. Now

00:00:58.451 --> 00:01:00.722
these different hands each have different names and

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:02.677
there are nine of them. So let’s talk about what each

00:01:02.677 --> 00:01:05.242
of these names mean and since this class uses

00:01:05.242 --> 00:01:07.958
python, I’ll start my numbering at zero.

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.194
The best hand and this one that you almost never

00:01:10.194 --> 00:01:13.761
see in poker is the straight flush and here we have a

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.917
straight flush. The suit here is hearts, so you can

00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:19.441
see every single card is a heart and they are all in

00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:23.358
sequential order, nine, ten, jack, queen, king. If you

00:01:23.358 --> 00:01:26.629
ever go into a poker form online, you would see

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:32.276
these cards were in as 9H, TH, JH, QH, KH and

00:01:32.276 --> 00:01:34.123
that’s the system we’re going to use here.

00:01:34.123 --> 00:01:36.844
The next best hand is four of a kind and here we

00:01:36.844 --> 00:01:41.178
have a four of a kind with four aces and a six. The

00:01:41.178 --> 00:01:44.185
six is usually irrelevant to this hand but we’ll talk a

00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:47.116
little bit about how to break ties in class. Next best is

00:01:47.116 --> 00:01:51.234
the full house and a full house is just three cards of

00:01:51.234 --> 00:01:53.615
one rank, so here we have three tens and two of

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:57.005
another, so two, twos. This hand is a full house so

00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:00.386
we would call it tens full of twos. Next is the flush

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:05.280
and a flush is five cards of the same suit and here

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.047
the ranks don’t matter. You can see we have a

00:02:07.047 --> 00:02:10.878
three, six, jack, queen and king but they’re all of the

00:02:10.878 --> 00:02:15.214
suit spade. Next we have the street and a street is

00:02:15.214 --> 00:02:17.876
just five cards in sequential order, five, six, seven,

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:21.009
eight, nine and here the suit doesn’t matter at all.

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.074
We have a spade, diamond, club, diamond and

00:02:24.074 --> 00:02:27.699
another spade. Our next hand is the three of a kind

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.847
and three of a kind is just three cards of the same

00:02:30.847 --> 00:02:35.299
rank, so these three fours are what’s relevant. The

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.969
queen and again in some special circumstances

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.581
where we’re playing with multiple decks, they may

00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:43.177
be used to break a tie and again we’ll talk about that

00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:48.460
in class. Next we have two pair, for example, a pair

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.662
of jacks and a pair of nines would be two pair. The

00:02:51.662 --> 00:02:55.058
second worst hand is a pair and a pair is just two

00:02:55.058 --> 00:02:57.808
cards of the same rank, here we have two threes.

00:02:57.808 --> 00:03:00.593
The eight, five, two don’t do much to help our hand

00:03:00.593 --> 00:03:06.158
here. Finally, we have nothing. So we could also call

00:03:06.158 --> 00:03:10.072
that high card because when two people who have

00:03:10.072 --> 00:03:13.341
nothing show down their hands, the one with the

00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:16.485
highest card wins.

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:21.533
Here we have king high and this is really quite a bad

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.653
hand. If you are ever in a casino, I wouldn’t go

00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:27.442
playing this and expecting win. And that’s it; those

00:03:27.442 --> 00:03:30.214
are our nine hands, straight flush, four of a kind, full

00:03:30.214 --> 00:03:33.905
house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair, pair

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:36.410
and nothing. Noticeably design them all in number,

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.487
zero through eight. This is one of the numbers we’ll

00:03:39.487 --> 00:03:42.904
be using in our poker program to compare hands. It

00:03:42.904 --> 00:03:45.114
turns out, we’ll need a few other numbers to

00:03:45.114 --> 00:03:48.818
distinguish between for example two full houses, six

00:03:48.818 --> 00:03:51.246
for six is inadequate, we’ll need to add some other

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:54.127
numbers in there but we’ll explain that in class and

00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:56.201
for now you should understand the rules of poker

00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:59.000
well enough to follow on.
