00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.375
So we knew from day one when we launched
the service we were going to charge,

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.530
so there was going to be
paid plans on the service.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.430
We saw no reason why we should
start off with a free plan.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.310
We were like, this is going to be
a business that makes money, and

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.600
in 2006 that was not vogue at the time.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.570
Quite honestly a lot of people
were like, build it for free,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.620
get a bunch of users, and
figure out how to monetize later.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.270
And we were just like, I don't know.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.050
It seems like we can monetize right now.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.860
Why don't we go ahead and

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.790
start that and then we don't have
to worry about the weirdness of?

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.521
Like, it's easier to give more stuff for

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:33.900
free than than it is to start
charging stuff for later on.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.570
It's the way we thought about it.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.386
And so, when we did YC, we had not
written any lines of code, and

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:41.744
we started in the January of 2006.

00:00:41.744 --> 00:00:45.190
And that's when we first started
writing and programming WuFu.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.390
And then we had an interface prototype
in February, so in about a month.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.740
And that interface prototype
allows you to see how a new way of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.550
building forms and designing them,
but it didn't hook up to a database,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.270
you couldn't save it,
you couldn't collect information.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.900
But it allowed people to see, like
this is a better way of doing things,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.640
better than what you would see,
say, from Microsoft InfoPath or

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.730
other form builders out there.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.530
And we said like we should ship this.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.096
Right, like see what people say,
basically do that step of talking users,

00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:11.900
getting engagement, and
get people excited about it.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.308
And so
we released an interface preview demo.

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:18.084
And that demo, at the end of it you
create and design the form, and

00:01:18.084 --> 00:01:22.070
when you hit the save,
it says thanks for trying out the demo.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.890
When you want to know when we finally
launch, give us your email address.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.287
And we got over 100,000 people
to go through that demo, so

00:01:29.287 --> 00:01:32.930
that when we'd launch we'd be able
to start off up front off of it.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.940
But, the thing is, part of that idea
also, again, came from Joe Kraus

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.890
surprisingly at the time, where he
talks about like a lot of companies,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.450
what they don't realize is that they
should not just beta test their product,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.290
but beta test their pricing.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.790
Right, their paid upgrade and
conversion triggers.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.680
And you're never going to know that
until you finally put a price up there

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.440
and put a button that says you
can't do this until you pay.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.630
And so like a lot of that
just resonated with us.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.220
We were like, this company needs to be
something that stands on its own, and

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.070
I guess you could say we were the kind
of founders that didn't have the risk

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.660
profile that, say, like, we're going to
take the risk on like, giving tons of

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.258
things for free, try to figure out how
to scale, and eventually monetize.

00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:12.860
To us, it was like, this is either
going to be something people pay for,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.382
or it's not.

00:02:13.382 --> 00:02:20.670
And I think for 99% of BDB sort of
companies and services, it's easy to do.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.270
I think I meet a lot of founders
who think I'm building something,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.190
it's better than the competition,
it's easier to use, it's faster, and

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.730
then I'm going to charge a whole lot
less for it, and I think that's usually

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.150
a mistake that people have, or I'm just
going to give it all away for free.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.031
That's just like, that's where you're
losing out on a lot of opportunity and

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:37.850
economics for stuff.
