00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.630
It turns out that this answer is also log base b of 5. Great work if you got

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.452
this right. Again, I think it's best to think about splitting this up into two

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:14.984
logarithms. Log base b of 5 and log base b of 5. We're adding three logarithms

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:19.880
together right here. So, we can really just multiply these arguments together.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.596
So, we'll have log base b of 3 times 5 times 5. That's how we can combine these

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:31.211
three logarithms through addition. And then we'll have minus log base b of 15

00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:36.842
on the end. And finally to subtract two logarithms with the same base, we'll

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:42.654
divide the second one into the first one. So we'll have log base b of three

00:00:42.654 --> 00:00:48.796
times five times five divided by 15. We have the factors of 15, which reduced

00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:53.965
to one, which leaves us with log base b of five. Now, there was one other way

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:58.345
we could have solved this problem and it involves using the power rule. Let's

00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:02.563
see what that would look like. We could've started by moving this 2, backup as

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:08.610
an exponent for the 5. So 2 times log base be a 5 would equal log based b a 5

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.260
squared. Now we can apply the same rules for adding logger items with the same

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.625
base. And subtracting logarithms with the same base. When we add these 2

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:25.108
logarithms together, we'll have log base b of 3 times 5 squared. We simply

00:01:25.108 --> 00:01:30.232
multiply these two numbers together. And finally here, we'll divide this number

00:01:30.232 --> 00:01:35.672
into this number. So to combine these logarithms when subtracting, we'll have

00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:41.604
the log base b of 3 times 5 squared divided by 15. Notice that 5 squared is the

00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:46.490
same thing as 5 times 5. So we're really back to what we ended with last time.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.113
Our factor of 15 simplifies to 1 so we're left with log base b of 5.
