00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.980
The question is, given a box and an image texture, how do the two get attached?

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.035
Given a location on the box surface, how do we find the corresponding location

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:13.620
on the image? This is potentially a tricky problem. Say we just try to use the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.887
location in the world as our input. This won't work well, because our crate

00:00:17.887 --> 00:00:21.860
could be transformed with rotations and scalings. It might undergo an explosion

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.920
that would change its shape. Any of these events would modify the world

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.648
position on its surface, making it hard to get to the same pixel location on

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:32.204
the image from frame to frame. This location problem is most commonly solved by

00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:37.728
adding two values to every vertex. These are called UV coordinates. Just like

00:00:37.728 --> 00:00:41.145
any other attribute attached to a vertex, these values are interpolated across

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:45.225
each triangle during rasterization. Every pixel fragment generated for the

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:49.334
surface will have these values available. Within the fragment shader these two

00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:53.497
values are used to look up the corresponding pixel location in the texture. A

00:00:53.497 --> 00:00:56.458
pixel on a texture is often called a Texel to differentiate it from a pixel on

00:00:56.458 --> 00:01:00.248
a screen. For example on this face of the box we want to find a texel color to

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:04.129
use for this pixel. At this pixel the UV coordinate turns out to be U equal to

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.291
0.2, V equal to 0.7. Using these two values like coordinates on a map we can

00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:16.469
look at the texel on the image and use this to modify the color of the surface.
