00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.490
Welcome back to the next module of the advanced operating systems course. Recall

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.600
that the Cornell experiment that we saw as the last

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.400
piece of the previous module argues for a component based

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.970
design to reduce the pain points in the development of complex software

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.680
systems. And industries that are designing and commercializing

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.300
production operating systems and distributed services

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.090
through the client-server paradigm, there is

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.170
another important pain point. And that is how to design for the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.300
continuous and incremental evolution of complex

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.670
distributed software systems, both in terms

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.010
of functionality and performance. The short answer to the puzzle is distributed

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.470
object technology. We saw how object

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.240
technology is employed in the Tornado parallel

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.750
operating system as a structuring tool

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.440
to allow the scalability of operating system

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.630
services in a parallel system. In this module of the advanced operating systems

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.200
course, we are going to see examples of how distributed object technology is

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.800
influencing commercial offerings in the computer industry.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.680
We'll start this lesson module with the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.750
discussion of the Spring system, which was

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.900
designed and implemented in Sun Micro Systems

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.360
as a network operating system for use in a local area network. Later on,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.820
Spring was marketed as Sun's Solaris operating

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.870
system. Before we discuss the Spring system,

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.140
a little bit of history and some personal connection. Yousef Khalidi, one of the

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.650
chief architects of the spring system, got his PhD from Georgia Tech in

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.430
1989 developing the cloud's distributing operating system,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.840
which is an object based operating system.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.580
And he was my numero uno PhD

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.139
student incidentally. Not surprisingly, the Spring system

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.280
was heavily influenced by Yousef's work with

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.115
clouds. And Spring came out commercially as

00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:21.630
Sun's Solaris MC product. And for the trivia buffs out there, Yousef is now

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.370
heading Microsoft's Azure Cloud Computing product. By

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.200
the way, Azure has nothing to do

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.930
with the cloud system that Yousef developed

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.770
as a grad student at Georgia Tech. Later

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.620
on, when we discuss giant scale services and cloud computing, we will feature an

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.080
interview with Yousef wherein he shares his

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.060
thoughts on future evolution of distributed system services.
