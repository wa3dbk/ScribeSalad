00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.634
How are the graphs of this exponential growth function and this exponential

00:00:03.634 --> 00:00:09.720
decay function related to one another? I bet you can figure it out. Once again,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.103
here we have y equals two the x, and y equals one half to the x. How do we

00:00:15.103 --> 00:00:19.282
transform one of these into the other? Do we need a horizontal shift, a

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:25.830
vertical shift? A reflection in the x-axis, a reflection in the y-axis, or a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.034
reflection in the line y equals x?
