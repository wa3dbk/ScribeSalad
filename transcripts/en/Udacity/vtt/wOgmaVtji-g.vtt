Hey everyone. This is Shaun. I’m the assistant

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:06.377
instructor for web applications engineering.

00:00:06.377 --> 00:00:09.200
Peter unfortunately couldn’t be here because he

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.180
is off doing something silly like graduating. So

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.738
you’re stuck with me.

00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:15.253
So let’s just jump right into the home work

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:18.442
solutions. First question was about interpreting,

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:21.151
testing, debugging. Actually all the homeworks

00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:25.982
are about that. And this question starts off with

00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:28.352
just a quiz, first off embedded JavaScript

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:31.489
programs use functions like document.write to

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.292
change the surrounding web page. Yes, this is true.

00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:39.510
We can take a quick look at something like this.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.010
So I’ve loaded up this HTML into a file and you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.117
can see there is a bit of java script in the

00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:48.585
script tag here, just a simple factorial function.

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:52.322
And then it uses the document.write method to

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:54.669
write out the factorial five, which is 120 and

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:57.680
then write out the expression five is equal to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.298
five. So this should write out 120 and then

00:01:01.298 --> 00:01:05.918
true. So if we load this up in our web browser,

00:01:05.918 --> 00:01:09.946
we see that at the end of this, it has modified the

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:13.091
web page to write 120 and true. Now we haven’t

00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:17.146
done any kind of styling to this, so it’s just

00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:19.945
running right into each other. But the point

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.091
remains is that the document.write function is

00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:25.040
really how you modify on a basic level the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.215
overwriting HTML page.

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:30.360
Next part, testing can prove that a web browser

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.489
is correct. That is not true. So we can take a

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:37.438
look at an example of that too. So let’s say I

00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:40.730
have a basic square function. Well actually not a

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.689
basic square function, it’s much more

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.617
complicated than it needs to be. But let’s see

00:01:46.617 --> 00:01:49.728
about if we can prove this is true with some test

00:01:49.728 --> 00:01:54.121
cases. So let’s print out some test cases say print

00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:58.732
square three and this if you run it, okay that

00:01:58.732 --> 00:02:02.744
brings out nine that makes sense. But then if we

00:02:02.744 --> 00:02:06.383
print out another test case and we see this is 9-2,

00:02:06.383 --> 00:02:08.592
which is what we expect. So I am just going to

00:02:08.592 --> 00:02:11.249
print out a few more test cases, okay. We’ve got

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.735
a few more test cases here and we can already

00:02:13.735 --> 00:02:16.296
tell the square of 0 should be 0. And the square

00:02:16.296 --> 00:02:20.364
of two should be 4. So go ahead and run these

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:23.215
and we get the expected output. Now are we

00:02:23.215 --> 00:02:26.135
done here, are we proved that this is correct?

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:29.016
Obviously not because if you look at the code,

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:33.083
this isn’t going to return the square of X for

00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:39.819
anything that is were mod two equals 0 and X is

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.605
not two. Works fine for X as two. But when we

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:46.811
print out square four which should be 16, but we

00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:50.509
instead get is 8, which is not at all what we want.

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.899
So testing is great. Having simple small unit

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:57.682
tests is a good habit to get into. But you can’t

00:02:57.682 --> 00:03:00.847
really test for every single possible input. It’s

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:04.007
just not feasible. So you should be prepared for

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:07.540
accepting that your code is probably right. But

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.545
you can’t guarantee it with testing, okay. And

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:12.336
the third part program should compute different

00:03:12.336 --> 00:03:15.060
answers before and after it has been optimized.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.621
Now this is definitely not true.

00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:20.626
Program should be correct.

00:03:20.626 --> 00:03:25.015
Now what correct is, it can vary depending on

00:03:25.015 --> 00:03:29.077
what your actual goals are, but the program

00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:31.610
should work as you intend it and once you start

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.507
optimizing things that shouldn’t change. Now

00:03:34.507 --> 00:03:37.345
the final part of this quiz is making changes to a

00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:40.325
test case can help to localize a program bug.

00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:43.820
And yes, this is true. And we can see an

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.182
example of this. This is actually fairly similar to

00:03:46.182 --> 00:03:48.546
what we were doing for. So you got an absolute

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.764
value function and let’s say I’ve already told

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:52.657
you that something is wrong with it. And I want

00:03:52.657 --> 00:03:57.026
you to find where the bug is. Well, where do we start?

00:03:57.026 --> 00:04:00.178
Well, let’s try printing out, the absolute

00:04:00.178 --> 00:04:02.949
value of one because we’re trying to break down

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:06.944
on what part, what branch of this function, the

00:04:06.944 --> 00:04:09.170
bug that I’ve already you about is in. So we

00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:13.089
want to differentiate between positive values

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.939
and negative values and zero, is that breaks it

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.861
down to one of these two, statements. And we

00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:21.154
get out one which is the absolute value of one.

00:04:21.154 --> 00:04:24.627
So, okay that seems okay. Now let’s try and

00:04:24.627 --> 00:04:26.446
narrow it down a bit further from there.

00:04:26.446 --> 00:04:30.394
Okay, so let’s narrow it down a bit further and

00:04:30.394 --> 00:04:34.195
now let’s do the absolute value of 8, which is

00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:36.151
still right here. It’s still going to be in this else

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.643
statement, but since it’s greater than two, it’s

00:04:38.643 --> 00:04:41.481
going to go into this internal if statement instead

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:45.564
of this other else. So when we’re on this, we get

00:04:45.564 --> 00:04:48.874
0, not 8. So we see that the bug is in this and its

00:04:48.874 --> 00:04:52.407
fairly clear that that’s where it is and most

00:04:52.407 --> 00:04:54.681
programs that you’re debugging this is not

00:04:54.681 --> 00:04:58.592
going to be this simple, but you can add

00:04:58.592 --> 00:05:00.439
additional test cases and use your test cases to

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:05.131
narrow down on what part of your function, the

00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:08.105
errors are in. And that’s really the

00:05:08.105 --> 00:05:09.181
point of this, right here.
