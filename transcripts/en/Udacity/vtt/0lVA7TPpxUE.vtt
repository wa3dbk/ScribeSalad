00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.450
Let's look at the code for PrintSum in a slightly different way

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.140
by making something explicit. If we go through the code, we can

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.578
see that the, the code does something in that case, if the

00:00:08.578 --> 00:00:11.720
result greater then zero, does something else if the result is not

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.890
greater than zero but is less than zero, and otherwise in the

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.800
case in which neither of these two conditions is true. Nothing really

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.090
happens. So we're going to make that

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.290
explicit, we're going to say here, otherwise

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.430
do nothing, which is exactly our problem, the code does nothing, in this

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.380
case where it should do something. So now, let's look again in

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.470
our test cases, let's consider the first one, and I'm going to go a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.410
little faster in this case, because we already saw what happens If

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.890
we execute the first test case, we get to this point, we execute

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.710
this statement, and then we just jump to the end, as we

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.020
saw. Now we, if we execute the second test case, we do the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.740
same, we get to the else statement, the condition for the if is

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.770
true, and therefore we execute this statement. And we never reached this point

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.320
for either of the test cases. So how can we express

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.470
this? In order to do that, I'm going to introduce a very useful

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.450
concept. The concept of control flow graphs. The control flow graphs

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.310
is just a representation for the code that is very convenient when

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.030
we run our reason about the code and its structure. And

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.910
it's a fairly simple one that represents statement with notes and the

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.900
flow of control within the code with edges. So here's an

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.180
example of control flow graph for this code. There is the entry

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.790
point of the code right here, then our statement in which we

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.320
assign the result of A plus B to variable result. Our if

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.720
statement and as you can see the if statement it's got two

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.930
branches coming out of it, because based on the outcome of this

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.376
predicate we will go one way or the other. In fact normally

00:01:32.376 --> 00:01:36.000
what we do, we will label this edges accordingly. So for example,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.580
here we will say that this is the label to be executed

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.470
when the predicate is true. And this is the label that is executed

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.120
when the predicate is false. Now, at this point, similar

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.080
thing, statement five which corresponds with this one, we have another

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.650
if statement and if that statement is true, then we get

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.830
to this point and if it's false, we get to this

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.370
point. So as you can see, this graph represents my

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.040
code, in a much more intuitive way, because I can see

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.650
right away where the control flows, while I execute the code.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.730
So we're going to use this

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.430
representation to introduce further coverage criteria.
