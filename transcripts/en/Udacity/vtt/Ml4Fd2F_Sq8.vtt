00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.400
So, now, let's spend a little bit of
time trying to get an intuition of what

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.400
this M matrix is.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.040
So, the best way to think about what
an image moment is, an image moment is

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.440
a particularly weighted average
of image pixel intensities,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.840
and it could also be a function of those
intensities, and it's used to basically

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.120
give us certain specific property
at a point within an image.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.460
So, any image, shown by this rectangle
here, at any point I want to be able to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.670
find some properties that
are kind of descriptive and

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.230
something I can actually
find about an image.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.580
Now of course, what we will leverage
here is information driven by

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.720
the derivatives at that point.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.890
So the derivatives, of course,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.240
can be measured using various types of
things we've looked at and from that,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.320
I can find a gradient vector, the
magnitude of that, and the direction.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.850
The second moment matrix is
specifically a matrix derived from

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.480
the gradient of this function that
could be actually at this point.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.950
And it summarizes the predominant
directions of the gradient

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.092
of a specified neighborhood
of that point.

00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:04.540
So around that point, basically now,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.350
gives you more information about
the direction and the magnitude.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.140
One additional thing that's important
about the second moment matrix

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.570
is it also gives you a little bit more
information about the coherency of

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.910
the directions in that neighborhood.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.090
So let's look at the equation of how we
would compute the second moment matrix.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.070
Basically again, it is the intensities,
sorry, the derivative of

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.440
the intensities in X and Y direction,
and then the mixtures of these X and Y's

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.320
on the diagonals or off-diagonals, and
computed over any neighborhood point.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.040
And of course the neighborhood
search is this region here.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.790
So again, simply put, if I had
an image like this basically I can use

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.770
a second Loman matrix to at any point in
the neighborhood around that point find

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.730
description using the gradients that
is unique to this point, and actually I

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.580
want to use this to understand more
about what's happening in the region and

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.590
that could be used to now compute the
information about if there's a corner

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.160
and what kinds of parameters associated
with that corner in that image.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.370
Think the note of course is,
and we've talked about this,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.620
is the importance of the ellipse and
the argon values.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.750
Again, something that
we've looked at before.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.750
Of course, when you have certain bits
of information, and again, if you think

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.700
about it this way, with the moments it's
kind of giving you information what's

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.300
the best possible rotation
around these two different axes.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.870
And, of course,
we use this to define two major axes.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.310
Or, sorry, one, for
this ellipse a minor and the major axes.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.490
And this kind of gives us what's the
most dominant direction for this region.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.980
And that's what we're interested in
here, is at any point in an image,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.320
finding these types of ellipsoids, and

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.880
using these ellipsoids to
find the dominant directions.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.240
And, of course, recall that item values
provide us with this information.
