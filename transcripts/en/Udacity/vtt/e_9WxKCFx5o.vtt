00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.311
First though, a little quiz to make sure we think about the implications of the 2 approaches,

00:00:04.311 --> 00:00:07.777
which we're calling again, thread per row and thread per element.

00:00:07.777 --> 00:00:10.003
It's not immediately clear which is better.

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:12.129
So for the same matrix,

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.216
which approach will answer these 3 questions for--

00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:18.755
please choose either thread per row or thread per element.

00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:21.859
And the 3 questions are, which approach will launch more threads?

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.895
Which approach will require communication between threads?

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:28.263
And which approach will do more work per thread?
