00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.000
We were so obsessed with the little
things that didn't matter

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.760
like the of a specific button or

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.120
the specific experience when the user
is clicking back but is not logged in.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:21.910
All kinds of side things that won't move
the needle and doesn't really matter.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.220
And it's very important to make sure
that the experience is perfect and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.580
you're nailing it on the first time but

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.340
you need to make sure that the product
is right and not the buttons.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.580
Need to make sure the general flow and

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.430
the problem that is being solved
with your product is right, and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.460
not the specific background color or
the perfect logo or

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.100
the responsiveness of the website
because that's optimisation.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.570
You do that in the AB testing part.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.500
You do that after you nail your MVP but
we did that before we

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.190
met them MVP and we waited a lot of
time on that and I wish we hadn't.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.940
It will not happen again.
