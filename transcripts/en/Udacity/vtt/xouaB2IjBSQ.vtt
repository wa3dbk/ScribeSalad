00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.928
2 is the correct solution set. Fantastic work if you figured that one out. We

00:00:04.928 --> 00:00:09.028
want to start out by finding the LCD for these three fractions. Since this is a

00:00:09.028 --> 00:00:14.558
quadratic trinomial, we should factor it first to determine the LCD. This

00:00:14.558 --> 00:00:19.882
denominator factors to x minus 3 times x minus 4. Since we have an equation, we

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:24.620
can multiply each term by the same factor. This keeps our equation balanced.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.739
When we multiply through by the LCD, we'll get 1 times x minus 4, minus 4 times

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.950
x minus 3, which equals x. We distribute the negative 4 to get negative 4 x and

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.000
positive 12. Next we combine all like terms to get negative 3 x plus 8 equals x.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.410
To solve this part we want to get our variables on one side of the equation and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.364
our constants on the other. This is why we add positive 3 x to each side. And

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:58.702
finally dividing both sides by 4 we'll get x is equal to 2. Our solution set. We

00:00:58.702 --> 00:01:03.706
know x cannot equal positive 3 and x cannot equal positive 4. These are excluded

00:01:03.706 --> 00:01:08.400
values. We check our solution set against these to be sure this is correct.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.653
Otherwise it, we would have no solution.
