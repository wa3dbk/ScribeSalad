00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.870
Okay, I'm going to show you how I arrived at my answer. So

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.689
I'm going to select this line. And I'm actually going to use the Python

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.020
IDE, to, to figure out the kind of structure of this document.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.080
Here we are in the IDE. I'm going to paste in that first line.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.765
So I pasted in that first line. It's in a variable called

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:17.850
reddit_front. We can go ahead, and run length on it. We see

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.150
it's 26,000 characters. Okay, so the first thing I'm going to do is

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.530
import json. And then I'm going to convert this, this document into json

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.450
using the loads function in the json module. So now I've got

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.810
this big dictionary: j. And it's got all this stuff in it. Actually,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.940
that wasn't very useful. It just printed everything. So let's look at j.keys.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.100
We can see there are two keys here: kind and data. Data is

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.910
almost certainly the one we want. Let's look at that. Oh, another

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.070
bunch of stuff. Let's look at the keys on this. This has just

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.620
four keys: after, before, children, and modhash. Children is going to be one

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.600
we want. The other ones are just simple little variables. So let's look

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.690
at children. Now we're starting to get somewhere. Let's look at the keys

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.900
of this. It's a list. So it's probably a list of lengths. Which

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.570
is kind of what we're expecting. Let's look at one of these. Again,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.000
a bunch of crap. But let's look at the keys for the first

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.030
element in the links, or in this children's list. We can see that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.150
it has kind and data. So let's look at the data for this

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.430
guy. We're starting to get a little bit closer. Let's see what the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.720
keys are for this guy. Aha, perfect. And we can see that 'ups' is

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.400
actually in this. So if I were to call ups, we can see that

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.280
it is the integer of the number of ups on this link. So that's how

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.150
I found this. So, looking at our total JSON document, were going to look at

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.750
data, were going to look at children. And

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.770
then for each of the children, were going to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.670
sum up the ups. If I were to change zero to one, to find

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.900
the second element on the list, we can see that we get another variable. I'm

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.960
going to take this piece of code with me into the ide, and were going to write

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.700
a function to add up all the ups. Okay, here we are in the ide,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.790
and what we want to do is we want to sum up all

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.030
of the ops. So I can say sum. So I'm going to

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.540
say C data ups, for C in data children. Basically what

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.500
I'm doing, is I'm iterating over the list data children, which

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.160
we know is a list. For C, and each element in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.920
that list, I'm going to look up data ups on that object

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.430
C. And then we're going to sum it up using the Python

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.970
built in function, sum, and I'm just going to return that.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.770
Let's give that a run. J is not defined. That's

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.590
means I didn't load the actual string of the Reddit

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.420
frontpage in JSON, into a JSON object. So let's do

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.920
that. Let's run that again. Here we go. Now, here's your

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.860
answer, 103978. Simple enough. Now, what I wanted you to

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.160
accomplish there was just learn how to you now load this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.720
into JSON, and then manipulate the data structure a little

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.300
bit. And, you can see it's just like manipulating any Python

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.020
data structure because JSON maps very cleanly to what we

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.330
already have been working with in Python which is dictionaries

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.150
and lists and integers and floats and that sort of

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.410
thing, so. Pretty handy there. You are now a JSON expert.
