00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.590
Here the solutions are negative 5 plus or minus 2 root 6 all divided by 3.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.426
Great algebra skills if you got this one correct. You may have also entered

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:13.760
this as your answer. This is correct as well. You would of divided 3 into the

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.390
first term and 3 in the second term. Since there's no common factors we just

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.698
list these two terms as fractions. With a plus or minus symbol in between. To

00:00:21.698 --> 00:00:25.909
start this problem, we take the square root of both sides of our equation. And

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.570
we indicate the plus or minus sign for this root. So we'll have 3x plus 5 on

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.184
the left. And positive or negative root 24 on the right. Next, we want to

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:39.368
isolate this 3x by subtracting 5 from both sides. We'll get 3x equals negative

00:00:39.368 --> 00:00:44.744
5, plus or minus root 24. And finally, to solve for X, we divide both sides by

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:49.775
the coefficient 3. This leaves us with 1x equal to negative 5 plus or minus

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:54.315
root 24, all divided by 3. We want to look to see if we can simplify any

00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:59.860
radicals, if possible. The square root of 24 is simplifies to 2 times root 6.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.260
So we can replace this here in our final answer.
