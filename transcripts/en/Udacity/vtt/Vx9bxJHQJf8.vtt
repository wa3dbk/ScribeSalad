To continue with our story, these participants are randomly assigned to either

00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:08.946
the control group, where they take the placebo pill, or the experimental group,

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:13.414
where they take the active pill. They take the pill at the same time of day, on

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:17.634
the same day, and the same place. And then, they all go to bed in a sleep lab at

00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:22.545
the same time. While sleeping, researchers observe the particpant's sleep

00:00:22.557 --> 00:00:27.680
patterns and rate their quality of sleep. Do you think these researchers should

00:00:27.692 --> 00:00:32.604
or should not know which treatment participants received? Why or why not? Yes,

00:00:32.712 --> 00:00:37.945
because their ratings will depend on which treatment the people received. No, to

00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:43.190
help maintain participant confidentiality. Yes, because the researchers ratings

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:47.955
will be more accurate. Or no, because if they know, their judgements may be

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:49.967
biased. What do you think?
