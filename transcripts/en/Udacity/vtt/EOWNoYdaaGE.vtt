00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Alright, let's go through his together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Checking whether or not the tags match is as simple as checking to see if

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the entry tag name matches the exit tag name

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
or the beginning tag name matches the closed tag name.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If they're not the same, then we'll indicate as much by calling graphics.warning.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Otherwise, they are the same, so I just tell our graphics library that we're beginning this tag.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's a bold tag. There may be some arguments. In this case, there aren't.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I call interpret on all the subtrees.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's convenient that we made interpret work on trees instead of single elements

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
because now it's just 1 line to call it here.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
When I'm done, and this is critical, we have to call graphics.endtag.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Otherwise, it would be run away bold.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The whole rest of the webpage would be bold.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We need to stop doing whatever this tag did.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We only want to apply it over the span that it controls.
