00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.886
Let's put to work what we learned about arithmetic with a pretty interesting

00:00:02.886 --> 00:00:07.532
problem. The digital camera in your smart phone takes pictures where a red

00:00:07.532 --> 00:00:12.903
green and blue values can be any number between 0 and 355. That's 256

00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:16.807
possibilities for red, the same for green and for blue and that's millions of

00:00:16.807 --> 00:00:22.320
possibilities, giving you pretty big files. Now here on planet Earth that's not

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.978
a problem. But here on our rocket ship that's exploring a distant planet and it

00:00:26.978 --> 00:00:31.194
wants to send photos back, maybe a less arrange of colors would preferably

00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:37.862
suffice. So, I'd like to cut down this range into the much smaller range from 0

00:00:37.862 --> 00:00:43.968
to 5. And I'd like to do that in a uniform way. What I mean was that if I look

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:48.832
at the interval of numbers between 0 and 255, that approximately 1 6th of them

00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:56.697
should amount to 0. The next 1 6th to 1, the next 1 6th to 2 and so on. Here's

00:00:56.697 --> 00:01:02.585
a way of doing that. First multiply by 6. And then divide by the length of this

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:08.061
interval. Then all the numbers in here will be 0, all the numbers in here will

00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:15.326
be 1, here they will be 2 and the the last region there will be 5. Now I'll

00:01:15.326 --> 00:01:23.740
give you a number of choices for the Java code for doing this. And I'm asking

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.509
you to pick the right one.
