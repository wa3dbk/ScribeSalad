00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.906
Which way is up to you, the y or z axis?

00:00:02.906 --> 00:00:09.012
I mean when you're working on a workstation and your screen is vertical, then I think of it as y up but people

00:00:09.012 --> 00:00:13.160
working with pads now you sort of have this case where the z is coming out of

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.286
your pad, your tablet, because you're working in this direction.

00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:24.927
I would say, negative y Because that's how my old VGA card on my PC worked. For some reason

00:00:24.927 --> 00:00:29.746
the Y axis points downwards on them so when you started making the first 3D

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:35.039
effect which was like, you know, the star scroller, you're like flying toward in

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.400
a some kind of galaxy with stars. You ended up with, you know, when you

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.103
increased Y the points were moving downwards. So I would say - negative y, that's up.

00:00:44.103 --> 00:00:49.279
For me, because I'm in a shop all the time, z is always up. And

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:53.420
then that has to do a lot with like CNC machining, you know. If I'm in the shop

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.190
it's always the Z, if you're doing 3D printing it's always the Z axis.
