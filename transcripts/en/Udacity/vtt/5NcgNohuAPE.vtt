00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.210
Today we will talk about Case-Based Reasoning. In Case-based reasoning,

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.610
the cognitive agent addresses new problems by tweaking solutions to

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.120
similar previously encountered problems. Case-based reasoning builds on

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.920
the previous lesson on learning recording cases. In learning recording cases,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.510
the new problem is identical to the previous problem. In case-based reasoning,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.220
the new problem is similar to a previously encountered problem. Case-based

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.600
reasoning typically has several phases, case retrieval, case adaptation,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.572
case evaluation, and case storage. We'll also discuss certain advanced processes

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:42.610
of case-based reasoning which will include new methods for case retrieval.
