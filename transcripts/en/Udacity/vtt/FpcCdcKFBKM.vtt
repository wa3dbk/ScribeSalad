Before I show you the next part of my interview with Cole,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.110
I'd like you to read about a blog post that we're going to discuss.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.700
You can find a link to that blog post in the instructor notes.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.000
This post was shared by Andy Kriebel,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.100
a data visualization guru over at Facebook.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.820
He's got an interesting blog named VizWiz and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.040
he's also got a really funny quote on his main page.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.470
We'll talk more about why this is true towards the end of the course, but

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.940
I just wanted to show you this humorous quote.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.390
For now, what I would like you to do,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.180
is to read through each of these tabs by clicking on the Next button.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.820
In each of these panels, Alberto Cairo is going to walk you

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.540
through the design process for creating data visualizations.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.450
He lays out how he created the graphic for the cover of his book.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.280
In the final tab, you'll actually get to see that graphic, and

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.230
I really want you to take some time to play around with the final graphic that

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.120
he arrives at, and then, answer these next questions.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.950
What's the average percentage of obese people in all the states?

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.880
Which state has the largest percentage of its population that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.270
obtained a Bachelor's degree or more?

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.280
Enter that two letter state abbreviation here.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.210
And then finally, do more states have a majority of obese people or

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.540
educated people?

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.450
Choose one of these.
