Again, this is neural-plasticity in action. Neurons develop and are strengthen

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.946
with use and stimulation and die off when not used. That's why stimulation is

00:00:09.946 --> 00:00:13.466
so important. Especially for babies and toddlers who have tonnes of neurons

00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:17.320
waiting to form connections. After a year or two of being neglected or

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.071
under-stimulated socially, emotionally, or cognitively. There's a noticable

00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:25.305
difference between toddlers who were stimulated, and toddlers who were under

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:26.540
stimulated.
