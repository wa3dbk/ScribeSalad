00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And now for the homework. It comes in two parts.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In the first part, you get a mystery-test function

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that is the function which returns pass or fail,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for which you don't have the source code,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and you get 5 string inputs all representing HTML input.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Your job is to determine 5 simplified inputs

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in which every character is relevant and which make the mystery-test function fail.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, from a hundred-line input,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
this is supposed to return the 1 line or the 8 characters or whatever it is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that suffice to make the mystery-test function fail.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Hint: There is Delta Debugging for it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The second part is actually just the same as above.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
However, try to produce these simplified inputs with a minimum of tests.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
For this you can rely on the HTML structure, as we just saw.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Your challenge, of course, is to split these inputs

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
into tokens, attributes, and regular text in the first place.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Second, not only should your approach take a minimum of tests

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
for these 5 inputs but also for other arbitrary inputs.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And also, possibly, for other arbitrary mystery-test functions.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We might even make a competition of that.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Who is able to come up with the best simplifier for HTML?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The winner will get La Grande Coupe de Débogage Delta,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
which is how Delta Debugging is called in French. Enjoy.
