00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.990
In cycle 44, we will be broadcasting the sixth instruction's result.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.110
So this value 42 gets deposited in ROB6. We mark that as none.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.390
We also broadcast the value 42 under the name ROB6, but nobody's waiting for

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.790
anything, so that kind of ends the broadcasting of that value.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.330
Another thing that happens in cycle 44 is we're going to look at this,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.590
instruction here and see whether we can commit, and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.300
yes it can. We look at it because is the next instruction to commit, and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.080
yes it can commit because it's done. so in cycle 44 we commit this. The way we

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.760
commit instructions again is take the value of 12, put it in register R1. Next,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.090
look at the ROB entry for R1, and see whether it's pointing to us. It is not,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.410
so we don't update the RAT to point here. Basically, the RAT still needs to

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.090
point here. Because that's still the most recent value for R1 that we will have.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.730
And then we can free this ROB entry, and the commit point moves here.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.300
So next cycle, we will be looking at this to commit. In cycle 45.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.860
We will try to commit this instruction. It's done, so we can. we take 3,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.640
put it in R3. We check the ROB entry for R3. It does point to us.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.560
So we need to make RAT entry for R3 point back to the register 5.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.670
Pretty much from now on, instructions that want to read R3 are actually going to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.240
find it in the register file. And now that we have done that,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.530
we can free this ROB entry. Now we're ready to move to Cycle 46.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.630
In Cycle 46 we will try to commit this instruction. And it's ready to commit so

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.690
we can. We commit it by writing 36 into R1. And we check the RAT entry for

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.700
R1. Is it pointing to ROB 4? It is not, so you don't change the RAT.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.120
And we have free this ROB entry. This concludes what has happened in cycle 46.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.970
In cycle 47 we will try to commit this instruction. It's done, so

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.820
it's ready to commit. 47 is when we commit it.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.290
We will deposit 33 into R4. We will check the right entry for R4.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.740
Does it point to ROB5? Yes it does. Now it needs to point to the registry file.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.122
And we free this ROB entry. Now we move to cycle 48,

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:14.670
where we try to commit this instruction. It's done so it can commit.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.170
We deposit 42 into R1, so the final value of R1 is going to be 42.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.030
We look at the, RAT entry for R1. Is it pointing to ROB6?

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.690
Yes, it is. So finally, the RAT entry is made to point to the register file.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.730
So only now, instructions that want R1 are going to start looking at

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.480
the architecture register file. All the time until now, they would have found

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.630
the value in the ROB, or they would have had to wait for the value. With this,

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.390
we can finally free this ROB entry, and this concludes our example. So,

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.691
pretty much the [UNKNOWN] instruction is going to commit in cycle 14
