00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.320
Let's take another example to
now start building the kinds of

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.480
curves that we're interested
in from real data.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.960
Just to keep things simple,
rather than use my stack of real images,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.440
I'm just going to showcase these small
types of ramp gray scale images here.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.160
And I've basically have, kind of
simulated them to have a shutter speed

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.480
of 1/64, darker image, 1/16,
1/4, 1 sec and 4 secs.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.390
It gets from darker to brighter.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.670
Again, we're interested in getting to I,
the intensities.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.690
G is my function, and

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.600
the thing that we want to extract
from is exposure H, right?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.570
I mean that is the relationship,
because remember the rest of it

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.920
we actually were able to get
to from the camera itself.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.450
So now to get an exposure basically
we would base, have to compute

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.230
the irradiance, E, and with the time and
we know all of this of course.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.960
We can also do this in log because
that actually makes our curves and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.700
everything appear nice.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.060
And of course just,
I'm showing these pixel values here.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.870
And I'm going to basically create
an axis, the log of an exposure H.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.380
What we can do now is find, let's say,
three points, one, two and three here.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.550
At three different points,
I've colored them differently so

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.760
we can see where they are.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.020
And of course I now in this instance can
pick out what their values would be.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.880
Similarly now I can find three
similar exact points in another image.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.060
And I'm actually just randomly
walking around in these five images.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.950
And if you notice that basically
I can find these three

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.260
points in all of these images.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.720
You know how to get these images,
feature tracking and

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.330
feature detection work, or
feature matching work that we looked at

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.130
allows you to find these types
of things in a real image.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.660
This is just a synthetic test
case that I'm showing you.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.930
Of course, after I find these points,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.700
I can actually use this
to plot these values.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.150
Of course, I'm showing this purple here.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.670
While I just have five images here,
you can imagine I may have more.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.410
And this would allow me to get
a bunch of different values here.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.590
So here you have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.480
ten, eleven, and so on.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.090
This allows me to kind of,
you know, blot these out.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.420
I can do the same for turquoise.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.900
And here is the range change
that's happening in this one.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.750
Pixel values, log of Exposure.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.940
Based on this calculations again,
pure data.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.190
And in case of the yellow, basically
we see this kind of phenomenon.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.910
Where basically again we
have points like this.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.480
So I took a lot of samples, over ten
plus, and this is what it gave me.
