00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.870
Maps, everybody uses them and
many people love them.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.150
Maps on mobile devices like this one
have changed the world over the last

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.160
few years.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.230
It's not that long ago you had to carry
a paper map of any location you weren't

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.520
familiar with.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.960
Or like me, as soon as you arrive at
an airport, you'd study the route to

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.020
the hotel, memorizing it so you wouldn't
have to stop in a strange place and

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.020
unfold a large piece of paper to
figure out where you were going.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.940
Mobile maps not only provide
a local map in your pocket, but

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.570
also a map of the entire
world down to street level.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.560
They also include cool things such as a
view of the street as if you were there

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.770
or a 3D fly-around of many major cities.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.810
There are so many ways that maps
can help you build a better app.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.270
Maybe you have a business and you want
to direct people to that business.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.280
Why not build an app that provides
navigation to your business from where

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.610
they are using location services that
you can learn in one of our modules?

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.490
Or maybe you want to create a treasure
hunt game, or plant a geocache.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.040
You can even do this virtually,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.260
where instead of hiding objects in the
real world, you put them in the virtual

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.580
world, with pins on a map that
your users will then have to find.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.940
There are far more scenarios
than I can think of and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.120
I bet you have a few
doozies of your own.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.300
In this lesson,
you'll learn all about Google Maps and

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.790
how you can build them
into your android apps.
