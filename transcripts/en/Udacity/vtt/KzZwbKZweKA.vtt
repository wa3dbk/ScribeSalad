00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.320
Let's learn another quick piece of syntax that is pretty handy, that I'll

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.140
use a lot in this course. And it's just for doing a for

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.900
loop. So, the syntax is very much like that of the if statement.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.890
In fact we use, false statements are like this, so, it's going to look like

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.560
this. Curly brace and then we'll have our for statement, percent, close curly

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.780
brace. And then we can have our, our the body of the for

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.350
statement. And just like the if statement, we have a closing block as

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.630
well. And our for statement will be just like the Python for statement, and

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.522
this, is, allows us to execute or print or whatever, whatever

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:31.180
is in body, do that, you know, in a loop, which is

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.910
really handy in a template. So let's go ahead and see a

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.370
quick example of that. Okay. We're going to leave our n the way

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.080
it is. Okay. And let's replace our if statement demo with a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.460
little for statement demo. So, I'm going to put all of this in

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.770
an ordered list. Now, we used unordered list before. Remember ul, ol

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.260
is this ordered list, which means I'll actually print the item number.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.060
It's kind of handy. So, for x in range 1 to n plus 1, so this'll basically if n

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.110
is 10, this'll go from 1 to 10. And say put a list item, for x

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.280
to the power of 2, x squared, which

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.572
is Python syntax for doing that. Now notice inside

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:13.690
the, the double curly braces, remember, this just means

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.370
print. So, and we can put. Just about any

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.210
arbitrary Python inside here, which is indeed what I've done,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.360
so x to the power of 2. And then we

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.070
end our for statement, and we close our list. So

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.010
let's go ahead and see if this works. I'm going to set

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.310
n to 10, and indeed, it works. And we can

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.750
see, this basically is printing x, 1 through 10, along, in

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.320
the left column, and then x squared in the right

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.300
column. let's go ahead and view the source for this file.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.298
You can see down here, here is the code we generated.

00:01:44.298 --> 00:01:48.000
Ordered list, and then 1, 4, 9, you know, 1 squared, 2

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.280
squared, 3 squared, 4 squared, all the way down to 10

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.390
squared, and then close ordered list. And so the template made it

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.500
real handy to do that. let's go ahead and see what

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.000
would happen if I changed this ordered list to an unordered list

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.180
in our code. So if we change this ol to a

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.220
ul, and we go back to Chrome and we reload this page,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.910
you see the o changed to u. And we go here, instead of the numbers for

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.330
our list items, we get the little dots. It comes up from time to time, these

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.850
days you often just generate your list markers

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.360
yourself using templates but. You know, for quick

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.150
and dirty, you can just use ol or ul to get, to get what you want.
