00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.530
Let's look at the answer
to our cache quiz.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.570
These three are very similar
to the options we have

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.689
when we want to get
books from a library.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.670
This is like going to the library every
time we need to look up something, and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.790
clearly we don't want to do that.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.040
Main memory is just like the library,
slow and very large.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.710
So if we go to the main memory every
time, we're spending a lot of time just

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.150
waiting for
the main memory to respond with data.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.600
Having the small memory inside the
processor core and bringing the stuff we

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.589
access there is the approach of
basically caching the memory locations.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.190
And this is very similar to borrowing
the book from the library so that we can

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.450
use it for awhile while we're interested
in a topic and then return it.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.700
And finally having a huge memory next
to our processor and then bringing

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.995
everything in there is solving some of
the problems of going to the main memory

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:55.990
because this memory is hopefully
somewhat closer to a processor.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.920
But this memory is still going
to be large and thus very slow.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.460
So this is very similar to just
building a library closer to home.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.110
Yes, you are saving some
time on each access but

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.100
most of the time you spend
per access is still there

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.640
simply because it takes a while to
find data in such a large memory.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.940
So caches are exploiting spacial and
temporal and locality.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.960
And overcoming the problem of having
a slow and large main memory, just

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.430
like borrowing books from the library
is exploiting spacial and temporal

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.850
locality, and overcoming the problem
of accessing a huge library slowly.
