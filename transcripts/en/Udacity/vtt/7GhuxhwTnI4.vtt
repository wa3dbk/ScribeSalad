00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.380
So, if we're going to run the Car function we just to make sure that it

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.380
runs in the right context.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.260
Luckily, we have a way of running functions in whatever context we choose.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.830
The .call method of any function allows us to run that function in

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.290
exactly the context we want it to.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.680
It basically means that the parameter this is going to behave even more

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.690
similarly to a positional function parameter.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.010
Now we just have to decide what value to pass as our first argument so

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.560
that Car can run in the right context.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.700
What do you think we should pass in?
