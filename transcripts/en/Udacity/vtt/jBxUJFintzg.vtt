If you feel comfortable carrying out all the steps at once right now for

00:00:03.257 --> 00:00:06.777
figuring out the equation of this line and then putting it in slope intercept

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:10.437
form, please go right ahead. Then you can check your steps by walking through

00:00:10.437 --> 00:00:14.162
what I'm doing afterward. Of course, there are also multiple approaches to this

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:17.831
problem. I'm just going to show you the one that I think is the most efficient.

00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:21.497
Now that we found the slope, I would recommend using the point slope form

00:00:21.497 --> 00:00:25.401
substituting in our value of m that we just found and the coordinates of one of

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:29.867
these points. What equation end-points slope form do you get? Remember, you can

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:31.795
choose either one of these points.
