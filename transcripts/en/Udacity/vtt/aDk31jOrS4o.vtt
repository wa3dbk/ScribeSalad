00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm working with acceleration here other than the force

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because acceleration is already offered by the rest of the program,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and I said before, I can reuse one of these accelerations,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which is why I start the initial acceleration in this variable code, well, initial acceleration.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Here comes Euler as we know it, these two lines,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and then I'll form the average of the velocities to go to the next step

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I'll form the average of the accelerations to go to the next step and that's all.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If you run that program, you see two series of data.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The upper one is the one that we know, the errors of the forward Euler's method,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and the lower one are the errors of Heun's method and you see these are really low.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So this method really rocks out.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
On top of that, you see that this seems to be a parabola.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
While Euler's method almost forms a line here, Heun's method forms a parabola.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So it's good and it even gets better as we shrink the step size.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
There is a price to pay--we call that acceleration function twice.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If you look at what we get for that price, that really pays off.
