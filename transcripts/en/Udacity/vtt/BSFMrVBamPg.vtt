00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.804
Now let's take this opportunity 
to go ahead and create

00:00:02.804 --> 00:00:04.267
our own custom view.

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:06.531
We don't need one in particular 
for Sunshine,

00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:08.438
so you can go ahead and choose anything.

00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:12.002
Personally, I'm a fan of Compass Control, 
so that's what I've been building.

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.112
You'll need to include three Constructors

00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:16.817
to support your view being created in code

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.767
through a resource or through inflation,

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:22.271
then simply override the onMeasure method
and set your dimensions.

00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:24.857
Click here when you're done, 
and, you're ready to get started

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.680
drawing the contents of your view.
