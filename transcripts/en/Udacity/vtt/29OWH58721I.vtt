00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.920
Assistive technology is an umbrella
term for a broad range of devices,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.198
software and tools that help any person
with a disability complete a task.

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:13.920
In the broader sense this include
something as low tech as a crutch to

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.890
help someone walk or
magnifying glass to assist reading, or

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.670
as high tech as a robotic prosthesis or

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.580
image recognition software
running on a smartphone.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.720
It can include something as
general as browser zoom or

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.510
as specific as a custom-designed
game controller.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.610
It can be a separate physical
device like a braille display, or

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.710
be implemented completely in
software like voice control.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.490
It can be built into an operating
system like some screen readers or

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.140
it can be an add-on like
a Chrome extension.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.750
And assistive technology in
particular is pretty blurry.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.030
After all, all technologies being built
to assist people with some task or

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.190
another, and things often move in and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.530
out of the assistive
technology category.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.820
For example, one of the earliest
commercial speech synthesis products was

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.580
a talking calculator for the blind, and
now we see speech synthesis popping up

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.710
all over the place, from driving
directions to virtual assistance.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.380
On the other hand,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.490
technology which is general purpose
often finds an assistive use.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.130
For example, people may use
their smartphone's camera zoom

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.120
to get a better look at something
small in the real world.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.210
In the context of web development we're
still talking about a diverse range of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.130
technologies that we want to support.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.640
People may interact with your
website using a screen reader or

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.070
braille display with a screen magnifier,
via voice control,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.190
using a switch device, or
some other form of assistive technology

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.670
which adapts the page to create a more
specific interface that they can use.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.410
For all of these technologies, ensuring
that our website support assistive

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.410
technology uses is going to come down to
programmatically expressed semantics.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.220
But before we can explain exactly what
programmatically expressed semantics

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.750
refers to, we need to talk
a little bit about affordances.
