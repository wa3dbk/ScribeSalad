Now, from here, we need to bounce back and update any entity file that create a

00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:08.429
physics body. In the entity definition object that's passed into the physics

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.874
engine, we need to add a user data object, which contains some metadata that we

00:00:11.874 --> 00:00:16.890
can later use for collision responses. Most importantly, is an object that

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.184
points back to the this object for this entity. And any other datda that you

00:00:20.184 --> 00:00:23.289
might need. For example, a unique string that represents an ID.
