00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.360
We've covered a few new topics
in Android such as making custom

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.260
preferences with custom attributes,
using support library annotations, and

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.660
using shared preference listeners.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.850
Most importantly we've now covered
the primary air estates for

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.950
the interaction points for our app.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.030
It's important to take a moment here
to remember what we've done and

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.070
to talk about how to generalize
this process to work on whatever

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.000
app you may be refining.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.230
First, we identified what interaction
points existed in our app,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.850
each of which is a place where
errors and bugs can creep in.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.440
Then we looked at what we already
done well at each of these points and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.250
what air cases we had
not covered already.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.960
This gives us a list of issues to
cover to avoid bugs in our app.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.340
In a real app, we would also want to
take user feedback into account when

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.040
coming up with a list of
changes to spend resources on.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.040
Finally, we went through
each of the issues and

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.500
designed a solution to
the problem at hand.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.090
Some of these solutions were simple and
straight forward.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.480
Some of them were more complex and

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.660
required prioritization but by covering
these issues, we've made our app

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.510
far more comprehensible when
errors inevitably occur.
