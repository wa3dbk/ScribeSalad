00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.041
All right,
welcome back to computer vision.

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:05.890
We're going to continue introducing
particle filters for tracking.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.491
I also want to say thank you I
think it's Sebastian Thrun and,

00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:13.770
and/or Dieter Fox or somebody else
who's done a bunch of slides that have

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.280
actually lost their, their authorship
is lost to all of humanity.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.480
Because if you take a look
at particle filtering,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.270
you'll see these same
pictures everywhere.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.680
So whoever did them, thanks.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.290
All right, so you remember I hope,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.360
that the reason we're doing all this is
because unlike Kalman filter where we

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.100
were going to represent the densities to
where things are, are the nice Gaussian.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.870
The idea is we might want to
have an arbitrary density.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.750
And graphically, this,
that's what's shown here,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.660
the idea of propagating
a density through time.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.600
Now, the basic idea that we're
going to make use of is instead of

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.070
having some sort of analytic
representation of our densities,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.970
we're going to have
these set of particles.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.800
We've talked before about how
the distribution in terms of

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.520
where the particles are and
perhaps the weight of the particles.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.630
That's what we're going to
substitute for the density.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.790
Right?
And our goal is, so

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.820
that as we're doing this tracking,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.480
eventually we have a set of particles
such that the probability that you get

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.440
a particle at some particular place
is essentially the probability

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.050
that the state is actually at that place
having observed all the observations.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.750
And the way we do this is we're
going to do this as a Bayes filter.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.820
We introduced this last time,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.580
where we said that basically you
take your prediction from before.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.620
And the way you get to
your prediction is,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.540
you take your previous belief of all
the different places you might be.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.380
And talk about the probability that you
could end up at some given xt, you some

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.605
that all up, and that's your prior
belief that you could be at xt.

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:46.265
You take your measurement,
you multiply it by your likelihood and

00:01:46.265 --> 00:01:50.138
because of Bayes rules which does the,
the swapping of the variables,

00:01:50.138 --> 00:01:52.995
that gives us our new belief about xt.

00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:54.580
So we're going to take particles and

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.780
we're going to define a Bayes
filter using those particles.
