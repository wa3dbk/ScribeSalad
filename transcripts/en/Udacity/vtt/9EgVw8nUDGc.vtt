What is the opposite condition of cay plus 1 is less than or equal to sara?

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.199
Write a condition that's the opposite of cay plus 1 is less that or equal to

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:13.682
sara. So, a condition that's true when this one is false, and false when this

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:19.321
one is true. Do the same for these other two conditions as well.
