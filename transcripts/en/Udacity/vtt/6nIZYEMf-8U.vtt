00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.670
That pseudo code asked us to let i go from zero to the length over 2 minus 1.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.550
That minus one is always a little inelegant, I prefer to use the less than sign

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.498
here. Inside the loop, we were supposed to swap the position i and i plus

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:20.987
length over 2. Let's copy and paste the swap code. Here it is, but now j, of

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:30.090
course, is supposed to be this. Now I fixed up the code. And I'm ready to run.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.850
Here you see the result, the array before and after swapping. And you can see

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.260
these numbers are now where they're supposed to be, as well as for the other

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.160
half. I want to briefly talk about the code that produced this printout here.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.984
When you look over here, we call system.out.println and we can't directly print

00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:54.200
elements. As I said, arrays are more primitive then array lists, and an array

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.380
will not print out its value. This method here takes an array and turns it into

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.102
a string that lists all of the values inside. Though when you want to print out

00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:07.606
an array list, you can directly pass it out to System.out.printIn. When you

00:01:07.606 --> 00:01:11.728
have an array, you have to use this helper method. Of course you could also use

00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:15.686
a direct loop, but the helper method is more convenient. Now remember what the

00:01:15.686 --> 00:01:19.049
point of all of this was, the point was not how to implement the swapping

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.583
algorithm in Javam the exciting thing was how we discovered it in the first

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:26.288
place, we discovered it by playing around with stuff and not by worrying about

00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:29.765
exactly how the index values were or whether we needed a For loop or a While

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:33.014
loop and I hope that's the lesson that stays with you, if you need to do

00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:36.776
something that's off the beaten track, that's different from what you've seen

00:01:36.776 --> 00:01:45.910
before. Get out some Lego bricks, some coins, some candies, whatever, and

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.530
figure out what the operation would be with those. And that'll give you the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.118
intuition that you need in order to be a successful programmer. Programming is

00:01:55.118 --> 00:01:58.484
all about having the right ideas and the right intuition, not about pushing the

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:01.600
symbols of the programming language around.
