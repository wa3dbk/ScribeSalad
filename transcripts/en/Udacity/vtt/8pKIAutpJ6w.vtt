00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.620
And I want to conclude this lesson with three takeaway

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.190
messages. The first one is that having an effective architecture is

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.450
fundamental in a software project. Or as I say here,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.050
a great architecture is a ticket to a successful project. To

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.290
put it in a different way, although a great architecture

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.940
does not guarantee that your project will be successful, having a

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.930
poor architecture will make it much more difficult for your project

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.280
to be successful. The second message is that an architecture cannot

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.120
come about in a vacuum. You need to understand

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.550
the domain of the problem that you're trying to solve

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.480
in order to define an architectural solution that fits the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.220
characteristics of the problem. So a great architecture reflects a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.500
deep understanding of the problem domain. And finally, a great

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.630
architecture is likely to combine aspects of several simpler architectures.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.880
It is typical for engineers to see problems that are

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.590
new, but such that parts of the problems have already

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.540
been solved by someone else. An effective engineer should

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.270
therefore, first of all, know what is out there,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.760
know the solution space. Second, an engineer should understand

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.420
what has worked well and what has failed miserably in

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.870
similar occasions in the past. And finally, an effective

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.100
engineer should be able to suitably combine existing solutions appropriately

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.870
to come up with an effective overall solution for

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.750
the specific problem at hand. And this is just as

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.960
true in the context of software architectures. When defining a software

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.330
architecture, you should innovate only as much as you need to and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.850
reuse as much as you can. As we said early in the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.770
lesson, by doing so, that is, by innovating only as much as

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.100
you need to and reusing as much as you can, you will

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.960
be able to avoid reinventing the wheel. You will be able to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.320
choose the right solution to known problems. And identify suitable solutions for

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.925
new problems. So ultimately, you will be able to realize an effective

00:01:40.925 --> 00:01:44.080
software architecture that will help the success of your project.
