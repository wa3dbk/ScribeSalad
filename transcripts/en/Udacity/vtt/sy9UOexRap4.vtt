00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.282
The vertical asymptotes of this rational function are x equals 3/2, and x

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:08.767
equals negative 3/2. Here's how we find them. As before, we're looking for the

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:12.896
values of x that will make the denominator equal to 0. So we set 4x squared

00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:18.096
minus 9 equal to 0, and then solve for x. When we take the square root of both

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:22.622
sides, you'd get just X on the left-hand side, and we'd get plus or minus the

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:27.075
square root of 9/4's on the right-hand side, which is just equal to plus or

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:33.010
minus 3 over 2. So this time we have 2 vertical asymptotes.
