Matt, what are some of the most popular visualizations that you see on Poly?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.050
&gt;&gt; yeah, I think just kind of like the most often used ones because they're so

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.560
familiar and also because, you know, they're kind of the classics.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.760
We see a lot of line charts, bar charts and

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.700
scatter charts and then a lot of histograms.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.390
But it also depends a lot on the user.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.410
Like certain users will only make bubble charts, or only make,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.940
you know, hit maps.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.810
so, if you scroll through our feed,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.210
you can see a lot of different types of graphs.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.330
But those are the, the most often made types.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.460
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.990
And other any unconventional chart types that you see?

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So one fun thing about Plotley is

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.510
you can kind of invent your own chart types if you like to.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.450
We've tried to make it a really flexible environment for being able

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.030
to use different languages or different programs to be able to draw your graphs.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.570
So we don't natively support maps, for example.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.390
But people have made maps using different packages from Python or R.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.370
People have made network visualizations, which we don't natively support,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.020
but Someone has made a couple of those using a language called Julia.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.660
And then we've also seen people make sort of

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.460
just their own out of the box data visualizations.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.780
That mimic some type of event that they'd like to show a visualization of.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.440
That doesn't even necessarily have a name with a graph type.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.940
&gt;&gt; Okay.
