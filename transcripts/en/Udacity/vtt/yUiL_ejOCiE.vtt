00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.740
Now, let's discuss a special kind of
memory resident virus called Rootkit.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.780
A Rootkit is embedded
in an operating system.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.400
It typically modifies some of
the code and even data structures

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.750
of the operating system in order to
perform some malicious activities.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.010
For example, a Rootkit can be used
to hide a malware from he user.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.500
For example, when the user uses the
hours command to list the contents of

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.570
a directory, the Rootkit can change
the output of the LS command so

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.610
that the user will not
see the malware file.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.670
Similarly, when the user
uses the PS command

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.760
to see what programs are running
on a system, the Rootkit

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.300
can modify the output of the PS command
to hide the running of the malware.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.510
Let's study an example of how Rootkit
can modify the operating system

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.250
in order to perform
malicious activities.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.210
For example, the rootkit is trying to
hide the malware file from the user

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.940
when he lists the contents
of a directory.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.920
First, let's examine what happens when a
user looks at the files in a directory.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.209
Suppose on Windows,
the user use the command D-I-R, DIR,

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.840
for looking at files in a directory.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.350
As we show here this command
can be implemented by a loop

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.030
that keeps looking at the next
file in the directory.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.290
Now, let's look at how
a Rootkit can hide a malware

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.810
from the user when he looks
at the files in a directory.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.870
We know that files and directories,

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.400
they reside on hard drive, which is
controlled by the operating system.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.030
Meaning that,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.940
any access to the hard drive has to
go through the operating system.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.810
Therefore, in order to get informations
about files in the directory we have to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.060
go through operating system functions
in order to get such information.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.980
In other words, operating system
functions are being called

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.830
to look at informations about files and
directories on hard drive and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.890
return the results back to the user.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.490
So here is what an operating
system will typically return

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.180
when the user looks at
the files in a directory.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.440
That is, suppose the Rootkit is
not embedded in the OS yet, then

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.590
the OS will return all the files in the
directory including the malware file,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.758
say mal_code.exe.

00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:12.740
And this is the file that the Rootkit
would try to hide from the user.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.550
In order to hide the malware from
the user, what the Rootkit can do

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.990
is to intercept any function
call to the operating system.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.470
And then reason whether the call
will end up revealing the malware.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.340
And if no,

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.830
it will just pass the call to the
appropriate operating system function.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.900
And if yes, it's going to execute
the call, but intercept the result so

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.540
that it can filter out the result as
necessary, in order to hide the malware.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.390
That is the Rootkit intercepts
the function call to

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.580
the operating system and

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.060
knows that the operating system function
call is looking at files in a directory,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.217
and then it knows that the return
results may contain the malcode.exe.

00:02:50.217 --> 00:02:53.310
So the Rootkit will filter
out the file name so

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.050
that the user will not see
this file name in the result.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.530
So here you go, when the Rootkit is
embedded in the operating system,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.880
you can filter out the malware file.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.390
So when a user looks at
the files in a directory,

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.730
he will not be able to
see the malware and

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.110
this is how a root kit in the OS
can hide a malware from the user.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.520
Again, the root kit is able to
accomplish this by modifying

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.600
the operating system.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.250
In particular, it intercepts a function
called to the operating system, and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.420
future the result of the function calls.
