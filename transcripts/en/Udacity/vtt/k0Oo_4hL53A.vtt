00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.350
For this quiz, you'll be building a new family tree.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.190
Okay, well, not really.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.110
But you'll be building a new DOM tree, which is kind of like the same thing.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.770
We've got a pretty simple DOM here.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.980
There are two nested divs and then another div with the ID of family1.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.290
And under family1, you can see the children and their children.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.300
But there's another family and it's going to be called family2.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.300
It doesn't exist yet and you're going to need to build it.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.960
You can see family2 has a child and that child has two children.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.990
So, for this quiz, I want you to build on the existing DOM tree so

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.460
that the final one looks like what you see here.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.320
These are all divs that you'll be adding and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.260
you can see their IDs written right here.
