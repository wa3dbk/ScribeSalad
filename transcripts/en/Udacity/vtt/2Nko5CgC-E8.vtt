00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.088
Now we're going to allow the user to
create new notes by tapping a button.

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:10.312
When we have to add a new cell for the
table, notify the table so it reloads.

00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:13.660
The beauty of core data is that
it takes care of all of that.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.390
So let's create the new method.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.100
Try it out and
see what's actually happening.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.780
First let's add an add button and
link it to an IB action.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.125
Now, we get to implement this action.

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:30.887
And you might want to think a little
bit about what should go in here.

00:00:30.887 --> 00:00:34.390
Creating a new note seems like
the obvious thing so let's start there.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.881
Okay, so we have our new note, but
now do we have to do anything else?

00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:43.969
Should we update the table view?

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:45.247
Well you think about it.

00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:48.324
I'll go ahead and run the app.

00:00:48.324 --> 00:00:52.937
So we have a storyboard which
is updated with an add button

00:00:52.937 --> 00:00:56.510
which is linked to an IB action.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.871
Now, we get to implement this action and

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:02.628
you might want to think a little
bit about what should go in here.

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:07.550
Creating a new note seems like
the obvious thing so let's start there.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.302
Now do we have to do anything else?

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:12.589
Should we update the table view?

00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:16.281
While you think about it,
I'll go ahead and run the app.

00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:18.348
Tada magic.

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:20.632
Well, I don't know about you, but

00:01:20.632 --> 00:01:24.465
I usually want to see how
a magic trick actually works.

00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:27.710
So who's actually getting
the job done here?

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.615
It's the MVC, the notifications,
and the delegate at work.
