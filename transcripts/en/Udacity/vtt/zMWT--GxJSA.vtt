00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.070
To reflect the function F of X in the Y axis, we need to replace X in the

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.550
original funtion with negative X. This gives us G of X equals log base 4 of

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.280
negative X. Note that we need parentheses around negative X to show that both

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.960
the negative sine and the x have the log operator applied to them. To shift f

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.820
of x three units to the left, we need to replace x with x plus 3. That gives us

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.910
h of x equals log base four of x plus 3. Once again, our parentheses are super

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.830
important here. Think about what would happen if they weren't there. That would

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.161
mean that the plus 3 was outside of the log part of the function. What would

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:40.369
the graph look like then?
