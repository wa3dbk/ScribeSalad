00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.090
Now that we talked about requirements prioritization, let's try to see

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.110
how this might work in practice. Imagine that you have collected the

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.560
folowing set of five requirements for an ATM system, but only

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.680
have resources to satisfy two of them. Possibly three. I would like

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.550
for you to look at this list and suitablely prioritize the

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.220
requirements by marking them as mandatory, in this case you're going to put

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.840
an M in the space. Nice to have, in this case you're

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.350
going to put an N. Or superfluous, in this case you're going to put

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.005
an S. This is the set of requirements, the first one

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.342
says that the system shall check the PIN of the ATM

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:33.863
card before allowing the customer to perform an operation. The second

00:00:33.863 --> 00:00:37.575
says that the system shall perform an additional biometric verification of

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:40.881
the customer identity for example a check of the customer's finger

00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:44.294
prints before it allows the customer to perform an operation. Then

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:47.466
we have that the system shall allow customers to withdraw cash

00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:50.580
using an ATM card. The system shall allow customer to deposit

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.350
money using an ATM card. And the system shall allow

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.330
customers to change the pin of their ATM card. So again,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.600
mark those as mandatory, nice to have, or superfluous considering the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.170
fact that you can satisfy only two, possibly three of them.
