00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.668
Here you can see the effect of moving the near and far clipping planes through

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:07.152
the scene. Seeing this kind of clipping is usually a bug, not a feature. An

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:09.571
algorithm such as ray tracing doesn't have this sort of problem, as the

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:13.536
mechanism there is to shoot rays from the eye. These two values, near and far,

00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:16.840
are necessary for rasterization to work sensibly, due to its use of the

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.440
projection matrix. Well, at the minimum, you need to set the near distance.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.246
It's possible to form a projection matrix that gives a frustum with no far

00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:28.149
limit, the pyramid. The key thing about these two values is you want to set

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:33.050
them to be as close together as you can, without causing any clipping to occur.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.930
The near plane is particularly important to move as far as possible away from

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.948
the camera. The near and far values determine how the z buffer value is

00:00:39.948 --> 00:00:43.680
computed. Internally the z buffer value typically gets stored as an integer

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.696
value with some number of bits. For example, 24 bits is common with 8 bits for

00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:52.172
what's called the stencil buffer. This is a separate buffer I'm not going to

00:00:52.172 --> 00:00:54.967
talk about in this course but that can be used for on-screen clipping and other

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:59.371
effects. The z buffer has lots of bits, but not an infinite number of them. For

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.144
example, if you're rendering a sheet of paper on top of your desk you can

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:05.293
easily get z fighting even if you've modeled everything correctly and the sheet

00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:10.712
is slightly above the desk. At some pixels, the z value of the paper and the

00:01:10.712 --> 00:01:15.145
desktop will have the same value and the desktop can then bleed on through. The

00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:18.542
z depth range of values is spread between the near and far distances. It's

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:21.470
clear that having these two distances close together directly benefits

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.324
precision. However, with the perspective transform in particular, you want to

00:01:25.324 --> 00:01:30.100
move the near plane as far from the I as possible. Here's an example. Say we

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.746
have our near plane at a distance of one unit away from the camera, and the far

00:01:32.746 --> 00:01:37.629
plane ten units away. The NDC z depth does not vary linearly, but instead forms

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:42.600
a hyperbolic curve. For example, say we have an object that's seven units away.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.782
The NDC z value's about 9.0 when the near distance is one unit. In other words,

00:01:48.782 --> 00:01:52.770
the z depths of more distant objects are relatively higher. These objects that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.341
are farther away have to share a small range of z depth values. And so are more

00:01:56.341 --> 00:02:00.324
likely to exhibit z fighting. The reason the z depth values vary in this non

00:02:00.324 --> 00:02:04.105
linear way has to do with interpolation. We want straight lines to stay

00:02:04.105 --> 00:02:07.926
straight when using perspective projection. I won't prove it to you here. But

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:11.084
think of train tracks disappearing into the distance. Near the camera, the

00:02:11.084 --> 00:02:14.978
railroad ties are visually far apart. As you move toward the horizon, the

00:02:14.978 --> 00:02:19.082
tracks get closer and closer together. The distance between the tracks is the

00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.966
same, of course. And the track stays straight. But the distance between them on

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:26.952
the image changes. The w value for homogeneous coordinates is interpolated

00:02:26.952 --> 00:02:31.300
linearly. But when used for division, gives us this differing rate of change.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.318
To get back to setting the near and far planes. Say we're able to safely move

00:02:34.318 --> 00:02:38.240
the near plane to a distance of five units, and not cause clipping. We're

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.840
effectively taking this piece of our original graph, and stretching it to our

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.795
new range. First, we get the simple benefit of having a smaller range between

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:49.627
the near and far. We also get a more linear graph. The more you increase the

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:52.635
near plane relative to the far plane, the slower the NDC z depth actually goes

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:56.741
to 1. The long and short is that moving the near plane away from the camera has

00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:59.534
a large benefit, much larger than moving the far plane in by a similar

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:04.120
distance. Of course this all begs the question, how do we know where to set

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.126
these planes. The far distance is usually relatively easy to compute. Either we

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:11.898
know in advance or perform some rough computation to determine the distance to

00:03:11.898 --> 00:03:16.231
the farthest object in the scene. The near clipping plane is trickier. You

00:03:16.231 --> 00:03:19.192
usually have to have some rules such as not letting your camera get too close

00:03:19.192 --> 00:03:22.798
to the walls. Or some rule of thumb such as the, the near plane will be 1

00:03:22.798 --> 00:03:27.542
1,000th the distance of that of the far plane. Some more elaborate systems will

00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:31.102
do a prepass, setting the near plane very close to the camera. It'll do a quick

00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:33.786
render of nearby objects, to determine a good distance for setting of the

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:38.340
scene, and then render the whole scene. There's no single perfect solution.
