00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.620
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For the third practice problem, we were wondering how many tickets were sold.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.851
How many adult tickets and how many kid tickets. So, these must be the

00:00:06.851 --> 00:00:10.317
variables. We can let a equal the number of adult tickets, and we can let k

00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:14.078
equal the number of kid tickets. It doesn't matter what variables you use. You

00:00:14.078 --> 00:00:17.716
could use a smiley face or even a diamond. It just matters that you use the same

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:21.910
variable for the number you're representing throughout the problem. These are

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.760
the two equations we need to set up. The number of adult tickets and the number

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.738
of kid tickets should equal our total number of tickets. Using our variables, I

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:33.438
have a plus k is equal to 500. 500 was the total number of tickets sold for the

00:00:33.438 --> 00:00:37.833
fundraiser. The second equation involves the amount of money earned from adult

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:41.982
tickets and the amount of money earned from kid tickets. If we add those two

00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:46.526
amounts together, we should get the total amount of money, which was $3312.50.

00:00:46.526 --> 00:00:50.741
I've written our two equations down here and this time, I'm going to solve it

00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:54.875
using elimination. We don't always have to use substitution. I'm going to

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:59.419
multiply this equation through by a negative 4 so I can end up eliminating the

00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:04.022
ks. Here are the twp equations, and I can solve this equation for k. This allows

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:07.959
me to do substitution that can plug in 500 minus a in for k. Now, we don't

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:12.314
always need to do substitution, I could have multiplied this first equation by a

00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:16.370
negative 4 and that would have let me eliminate the ks. I could of solved it

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.592
using elimination instead. Either way you do it, you should wind up with the

00:01:20.592 --> 00:01:25.194
same answer in the end. First, I distribute the positive 4 to the 500 and the

00:01:25.194 --> 00:01:29.883
negative a. Then, I combine like terms and subtract 2000. Our last step is to

00:01:29.883 --> 00:01:34.711
divide by the coefficient of a, 3 and a half. And we get a is equal to 375. This

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:39.520
was the number of adult tickets that were sold for the fundraiser. We know the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.756
total number of tickets must add up to 500. So, I can replace a with 375 to find

00:01:44.756 --> 00:01:50.114
the number of kid tickets. Using some mental math here or an equation, we can

00:01:50.114 --> 00:01:55.429
get k is equal to 125. This is the number of kid tickets we sold. And to be sure

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.973
that your answers are right, plug them in into your second equation to make sure

00:02:00.973 --> 00:02:03.617
that the amounts add up to $3,312.50.
