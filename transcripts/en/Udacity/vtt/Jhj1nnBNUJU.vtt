00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.960
So, I've gone ahead and

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.280
added the .error method to the end of the getJSON method.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.680
Chaining in this case refers to just simply attaching another method to

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.310
the end of one method.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.280
So, we'll run .error if something goes wrong with anything that happens here.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.400
In which case, .error runs an anonymous function that takes in e,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.140
the error itself.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.200
But in this case we don't do anything with e.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.680
We simply change the text of the New York Times header element to

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.040
New York Times Articles Could Not Be Loaded.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.610
And let's go ahead and see if this worked.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.090
To test this, I went ahead and

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.340
messed up the URL, so let's go ahead and hit Submit.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.950
And, we can see that despite the fact that we got Rockefeller Center in

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.630
the background, the New York Times articles could not be loaded.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.270
This is a good way to make sure that even if the page doesn't work the way you

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.000
think it should, it doesn't completely ruin your user's experiences.
