00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.816
So, we know that this equation describes this circle. The distance from the

00:00:05.816 --> 00:00:10.910
center of the circle to any point on the circle will always be 50 centimeters.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.798
And that should make sense, because that's the length of our string. No matter

00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:19.214
where the end of the string is, we know that the distance from the origin to

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:24.590
the circle is 50 centimeters. Now, this distance is always constant and it's

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.585
called the radius of the circle. So in this case, the length of the string is

00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:32.433
the radius and it's 50 centimeters.
