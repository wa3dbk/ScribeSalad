That's it for this session on loops,
we've seen for loops, while loops, and

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.760
some that are in between.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.070
And regardless of which loop we're
talking about, you now have another way

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.480
of controlling the execution of
your apps, and that's really cool.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.290
See you in the next session.
