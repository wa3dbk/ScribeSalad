Investing in single founders is
something that most investors don't like

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.030
to do.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.620
They're used to investing in
teams of two's, or three, or

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.180
more because they believe that you
need multiple skills, market and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.080
complementary skill set in order to
drive an early stage startup forward.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.070
There are exceptions of course, and
it happens more than once or twice.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.990
But for the large part, my big advice
I like to give entrepreneurs is find

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.770
a co-founder that you want
to go to war with, right,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.250
that you want to actually do this
impossible thing called a startup.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.480
Someone that compliments you,
that you really want to go with for

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.720
multiple years to come.
