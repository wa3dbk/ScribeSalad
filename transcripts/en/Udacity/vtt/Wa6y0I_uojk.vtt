00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.260
So we've seen how to use recursive definitions to make

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.410
words, and to define concepts like ancestors. Now we're going

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.760
to see how to use recursive definitions to define a

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.120
procedure. And we're going to start with the procedure that we

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.370
already defined in unit two. We defined the factorial procedure.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.620
And we defined factorial as the number of ways that

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.620
we can order n items, and the input is the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.420
number n. And that could be calculated by multiplying n times

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.390
n minus 1 times n minus 2, and so on until we get down to the 1.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.760
So that definition is not very precise mathematically,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.345
and the problem with this as a mathematical definition.

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:40.820
Is, it's got this, dot dot dot in

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.820
it, and humans sort of understand that correctly, what

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.780
that dot dot dot means, but it's not a

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.510
very precise mathematical definition. If we use a recursive

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.940
definition, we can define factorial in a much more

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.750
precise way. And we need to do that by

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.890
giving a base case, so for the base case

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.870
we want to think about the simplest input, something where

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.269
we already know that answer. And for factorial, and

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.770
for many procedures that involved numbers, the simplest input

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.675
is the number 0. So if we try factorial

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:16.040
0, the number of ways to arrange 0 things is

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.030
defined as 1. So we know that result. That's going to be our base case.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.630
Now all we need to do is define the recursive case, where we want to define what

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.650
the meaning of factorial for any number n is. Where n is any

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.100
integer greater than 0, and we can define that in terms of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.600
the factorial of the smaller numbers. So if you look at this definition

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.750
with the dot dot dot, well we see that the factorial of n is

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.590
n times n minus 1 and so forth. Well, this what we have here, is actually the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.610
factorial of n minus 1. So that means that we can define the factorial then as

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.680
n times the factorial of n minus 1.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.690
And that's our recursive case, and this definition matches

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.550
our intuition well, if we think about factorial

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.420
meaning the number of ways to arrange n objects.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.750
This corresponds exactly the way we think about this, that

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.420
we have n ways to pick the first item. And once

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.550
we've picked the first item, well, we have n items left,

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.270
and factorial of n minus 1, gives us the number of

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.580
ways to arrange the remaining n minus 1 items. So

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.510
that's a way to define this mathematically. So now, I'll leave

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.670
it to you as a quiz, to figure out how to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.790
define a procedure, that computes factorial without using a while loop.
