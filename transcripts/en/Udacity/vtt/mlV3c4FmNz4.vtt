00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.190
As we increase the texture resolution, eventually each pixel covers more than

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.306
one texel. When a pixel begins to include more than one texel, minification is

00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:12.612
occurring. Under these conditions, the MagFilter no longer applies, so its

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:17.240
linear filter is not being used. So in fact, all four answers are correct.
