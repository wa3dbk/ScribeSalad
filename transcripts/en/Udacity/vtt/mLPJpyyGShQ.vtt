00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.104
let's think a little bit more about this new mathematical statement, it doesn't

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:07.886
show equality since this isn't an equal sign, and that means this isn't an

00:00:07.886 --> 00:00:11.358
equation so we are going to give it a new name, this is an example of an

00:00:11.358 --> 00:00:15.362
inequality, we'll see a few other types of inequalities a bit later on. Just

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:19.144
looking at this one we have in front of us though does it tell us that Gram's

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:23.702
profit has one particular value? How many different values for profit would make

00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:28.363
this inequality true? Do you think that no values for profit satisfy this? Think

00:00:28.363 --> 00:00:31.347
there's only one? Are there two? Or are there a lot?
