00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Sarah] This question comes from Crazy Puff.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
"Can you give some examples of how BackusÃ¢Â€Â“Naur Form is used in practice?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For example, being a formal way to describe a language,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it seems that BNF might find some use in creating compilers or interpreters

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or other tasks involving teaching a computer to understand text.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Also, BNF let's you go from the abstract form to the concrete form,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but it seems like in practice you'd more often want to go in the opposite direction.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
For example, given a concrete example of a Python statement,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
you'd want to know how the interpreter parses it. So, Dave, how would you do this?"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
[Dave] Thanks for the question, Tracy. That's a great question.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We're using BNF in this class to understand languages

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to see how we can construct the expressions in Python.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But grammars are also used by the interpreter to break the strings that we put in into their parts.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
When you write a Python program and you run that in the interpreter,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the interpreter has to figure out what the things are.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It has to figure out is this an assignment expression?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Is it a variable?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Are these parts of a number? Is it a string?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
All the things that we've seen in unit 1 and in later units are constructs in Python,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and we need the grammar that's built into the interpreter to break that string into its parts.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That is part of what's implemented, and when people implement interpreters

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
or compilers, they usually do it by starting by writing a grammar.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Then there's a tool that takes that grammar and turns it into a program

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that will break the string down into its pieces.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If you take the follow-on course to this--if you take CS262 programming languages course--

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that talks a lot more about how interpreters actually do that.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
There are lots of other uses of grammars

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
besides just breaking down programming languages into pieces.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Some are in the generative sense where you start from the grammar and produce strings.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
An interesting example of that is guessing passwords.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
There was a group at Florida State that looked at how to create passwords.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
First you learn a grammar from a set of passwords you might have.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Then you can create more passwords, and you can use this as a way of guessing passwords

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
or if you want to measure how strong a password is to estimate how hard it would be

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to produce that password from this grammar.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
There are lots of interesting uses of grammars to produce strings.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The more common use in programming languages is where we use the grammar

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to break an input which is all one long string of text,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that's your Python program, to turn that into the components of that program using a grammar.
