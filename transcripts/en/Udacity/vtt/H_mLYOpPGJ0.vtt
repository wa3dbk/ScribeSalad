00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.988
It turns out we want to multiply each part by the cube root of 3 squared x

00:00:03.988 --> 00:00:10.132
squared y squared. We want to multiply by enough factors of 3 x and y. To turn

00:00:10.132 --> 00:00:15.129
each of these powers into these powers. So for 3 to the 1, we want to multiply

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.787
by 3 square to get 3 cubed. For x to the 7th, we multiply by x squared to get x

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:26.370
to the 9th and for y to the 4th we multiply by y squared to get y to the 6.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.780
Keep in mind that this expression needs to be inside of a cubed root for us to

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.693
multiply these factors together. And since we multiplied this denominator by

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:39.560
this amount we must also multiply our numerator by the same amount. We're

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.813
multiplying by a form of 1.
