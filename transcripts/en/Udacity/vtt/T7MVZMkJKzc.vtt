00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, the last piece in understanding customer segments is

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
understanding their pains.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We've been talking about all the wonderful stuff that we do for them

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that makes them happy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What are the things that we could get rid of that actually is kind of like

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
they've been walking around with an arrow through their head,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and they've just kind of accepted that for a while, but when you come about

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
you could say, "Hey, we could solve these problems for you?"

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well, let's see what kind of problems we could solve.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Is there something your customers find too costly?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Again, is it about time, and it costs too much?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is essentially the flip version of the gains.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The pains are what could we solve for these customers that they hate?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Is there something about their product or service that's underperforming?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's missing features. It's too slow.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It doesn't work well. It's bugging.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And what are the main difficulties and challenges?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
One of the interesting things is that entrepreneurs come back and say,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
"Yes, the customer said this was a real pain."

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
"Our product really solves these problems."

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Well, one of the things you need to know is was this like problem #47 on their list?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Or is this in the top 3?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Because most human beings, whether they're in corporations or even at home,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
tend to only worry about the top 3 or 5,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
so when you find out that this solves a pain,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the question you need to ask is in context, well,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
what are the other pains you have?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And you really want to understand their top 10, top 20,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and then to find out you're #32 or 47 I wouldn't be celebrating,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but I actually would be asking, "Well, wait a minute."

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
"Is there any way that our product or service could actually solve

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
anything in the top 5?"

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And if not, maybe you're in the wrong customer segment,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and so you want to understand what's keeping your customer awake at night?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Or maybe conversely, maybe you want to keep them awake at night,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but you want to figure out what are their big issues, concerns, and worries?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And then finally, the last piece is what are the barriers to adopt your product?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Is it it costs too much up front?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Maybe you have a pricing issue to decide later.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Gee, it takes a long time to learn, or we're happy with what we have,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and it's kind of okay, and what makes your customers feel bad?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Frustrations, annoyances, et cetera,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and what do they fear?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Financial or social risks, what could go wrong, et cetera.

00:02:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You need to understand all of this.
