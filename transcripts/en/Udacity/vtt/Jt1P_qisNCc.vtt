00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.450
So let's look at the sizes of
some actual virtual index,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.220
physical intact caches.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.689
While doing the previous quiz,

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.850
we have figured out that the cache
size needs to be less then or

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.710
equal to the associativity of
the cache times the page size.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.030
So if we look at, for example,
the Intel Pentium 4 processor,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.750
it has a four-way set associate
cache and a page size

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.020
of four kilobytes and
it's level one cache is 16 kilobytes.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.970
The more recent Core 2,
Hehalem, Sandy Bridge, and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.590
Haswell processors from Intel
are eight-way set associative.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.100
Or course, they still have the four
kilobyte page size and surprise,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.980
surprise, the level one
cache is 32 kilobytes.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.880
The upcoming Skylake design from Intel
is rumored to be 16-way set associative

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.110
and you guessed it, it's rumored to
have a 64 kilobyte level one cache.
