00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.100
We just saw two of the three distinguishing aspects of

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.800
the rational unified process. The fact that it is used

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.810
case driven and the fact that it is architecture centric.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.950
The third and final distinguished aspect of R.U.P. is that

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.210
it is iterative and incremental. So let's see what that

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.870
means by considering the lifetime of a software project. Basically,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.120
the lifetime of a rational unified process consists of a

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.920
series of cycles, such as the ones that are represented here.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.070
Cycle one, cycle two, through cycle n. And as

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.990
you can see, these cycles can also be called increments.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.280
And each one of the cycles involves all of

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.700
the main phases of software development. In addition, each cycle

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.700
results in a product release which can be internal

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.210
or external. More precisely, each cycle terminates with a product

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.340
release that includes a complete set of artifacts for

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.150
the project. That means code, manuals, use cases, non-functional

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.840
specification, test cases, and so on. So, I've just

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.760
said, that each cycle involves all of the main phases

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.440
of software development. Specifically, each cycle is further divided

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.040
in four phases. Inception, elaboration, construction and transition. In a

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.290
minute, we will look at each one of these

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.840
phases in detail and see how they relate to the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.150
traditional activities of software development. Before that, I want

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.760
to mention the last level of these iterations, which happens

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.330
within these individual phases More precisely, inside each of these

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.230
phases, there might be multiple iterations. So what are these

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.070
iterations? Well, basically, each iteration corresponds to a group of

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.550
use cases that are selected so as to deal with

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.200
the most important risks first. So if you have a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.510
set of use cases that you're considering, which means that

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.450
you have a set of features that you need to

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.260
implement, you will select for each iteration the most risky

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.720
ones that you still haven't realized, and realize them in that

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.720
iteration. And then continue in the following iterations with less and

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.980
less risky ones. So basically what happens in the end is

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.960
that essentially each iteration extends

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.220
the functionality beyond the previous iteration.
