00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:05.120
Salza identifies eight design principles that goes hand

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.820
in hand with the levels of protection that we just talked about. In designing a

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.720
secure system, the first principle to adhere to is

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.950
economy of mechanisms, and by that, what is meant is

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.480
that the mechanism should be easy enough, so that

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.190
it can be verified. The mechanism should be easy enough so that it can be

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.830
verified whether it works or not, that's important, Economy of Mechanisms.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.610
The second principle is what he calls fail safe defaults, the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.050
idea is you want to explicitly allow access to the system

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.940
or information. The default should not be no access. The reason

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.090
for saying this is because if the default is no access then there is no way

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.180
to guarantee that, that information is protected. This

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.250
is a negative statement again. So instead of a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.129
negative statement like that, you want to explicitly

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.820
allow access to information. That's what is a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.510
second design principle, is in designing the system,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.910
you make sure that the default is fail safe.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.170
The third design principle is what he calls complete mediation. And by

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.910
that what is meant is that the security mechanism should not

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.310
take any shortcuts. For example in authentication, you want to make

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.830
sure that when somebody presents credentials

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.580
for authenticating themselves with the system,

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.950
that has to be checked completely. And what that means is that,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.220
there should be no shortcuts to authentication. An example of a shortcut,

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.280
will be a password file that lives on storage, if it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.910
is cached, for performance reasons, that can

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.830
be a source of secuirty violation. Because the actual password

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.419
file on the storage system may have changed, but the cached copy in memory may

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.820
not be reflecting it, and that would

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.760
result in violation of security. If the authentication

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.920
uses the cached copy instead of the persistent copy. So that's an example of why

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.840
you need complete mediation in designing a secure

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.950
system, so that's another principle that a secure

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.680
system should adhere to. The next design principle

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.030
is what is called open design, meaning that

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.540
you want to make the design completely open,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.340
so in other words you publish the design exactly

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.270
spec it out and publish it, but protect the keys that are used by the design.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.460
What that means is that cracking the design,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.280
even though it is published, in order to access

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.600
the design or get any useful service out of the system, you have to present

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.470
keys. And those authentication keys should be so hard to break.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.525
Computationally breaking the keys should become

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.980
infeasible. So that's what is meant by

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:23.120
open design. And what does open design principle also foster is the underlying

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.540
tenet that detection is easier than prevention. We

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.700
don't know what all attacks are possible from the bad guys. And

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.990
so it is not possible to prevent all of them. And

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.900
therefore, what we want to do is, you want to publish

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.760
the design but make breaking the protection computationally

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.060
infeasible and detect that a violation has

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.870
happened, than try to prevent it, detect

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.580
that a violation has happened, so that's the key idea behind this open design

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.600
principle. The next principle talks about separation

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.840
of privilege. You may have seen quite

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.530
often in banks, two keys may be necessary to open the vault of the bank.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.730
And the two keys will be held by two different individuals, so that both of

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.220
them have to come together in order to open the vault. So this is the idea

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.440
behind separation of privilege. The next principle talks about,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.130
least privilege. That is, we want to use the absolute minimum

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.130
capability that we need, in order to carry out a certain task.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.450
So the controls in the system should be based on need to know. An example would

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:51.080
be, to do certain things on your computer. For instance, if you want to install

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.500
certain new pieces of software, you may be able to do that as a normal

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.910
user on your laptop, but for certain things

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.010
you may need administrative privileges. So clearly identifying

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.830
what functions you need administrative privilege

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.230
or superuser privilege, versus, what functions

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.680
you need normal privilege and ensuring that the right level of privilege is

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.025
provided or afforded. By the system to the user, is an important design

00:05:23.025 --> 00:05:31.030
principle. And in fact, this is the origin for the idea of Firewalls,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.180
that are common these days in organizational setups. What firewalls do is

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.260
to insure that individuals within an

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.760
organization are able access external information from

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:50.370
inside the corporate network only on a need basis, or information that is inside

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.500
the corporate network is allowed to get out only under authorized conditions.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.160
So that's the, the need to know based controls, and that has become very

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.210
common these days with the prevalence of

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.700
firewalls in, in any administrative setup. Another principle

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.900
is, least common mechanism. Or in other words, if there is a mechanism that

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.830
the system wants to implement to assure

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.240
information security. At what level should that mechansim

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.980
be implemented? Should it be implemented in the

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.030
kernel? Or should it be available as a

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.900
library that is outside the kernel? Because there

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.280
are implications when something is inside the kernel,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.380
it has access to information that is also inside the kernel. Wheres, if it is a

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.480
library sitting on top of the kernel, then

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.760
you can limit the amount of damage a malfunctioning

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.290
mechanism can do to the system as a whole. So that's the idea

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.130
behind these common mechanisms. And the last design principle that Salza

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.620
identifies is psychological acceptability. And

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.890
by that, what is meant is the mechanisms being easy

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.260
to use for the end user, so that they completely understand what they are doing.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:18.220
When they are using a particular mechanism

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.338
that is provided by the system, so good

00:07:20.338 --> 00:07:24.280
user interface is something that is extremely important

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.530
as one of the design principles in building

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.750
a secure system. Two things jump out when you look at this set of design

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.196
principles. That is lead out by Salza in

00:07:35.196 --> 00:07:39.115
his seminal paper back in the early 70s.

00:07:39.115 --> 00:07:44.454
The first thing that jumps out is all of these are positive statements. They are

00:07:44.454 --> 00:07:49.180
not negative statements. I mentioned earlier saying that,

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.470
my system prevents all violations, is a negative

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.610
statement because, it is saying that my

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.610
system is bullet proof. No system is bullet

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.640
proof, and therefore all the things that are

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.144
being laid out as design principles are positive

00:08:05.144 --> 00:08:11.470
statements and they give a way by which you can say that these

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:18.080
are the things that it can do. And you build enough into your design, such that

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.440
you can detect violations when they occur,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.800
rather than trying to prevent them. Prevention is

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.380
much harder than detection. The other thing that jumps out is the fact that all

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.919
of these principles, laid out in the

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:37.900
early 70s, are applicable to today's systems and

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.950
these principles were crafted when computers were

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.690
not even connected to the extent that they

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.530
are today. So the two key takeaways

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.870
from these design principles are, first of all,

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:56.320
you want to build the system in such a way that cracking the protection boundary

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.850
is computationally infeasible. That's the first takeaway. The second

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.720
takeaway is you build the system to detect violations

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.780
rather than prevent violations. Because prevention is much harder.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.300
Detection on the other hand, is something that is doable.
