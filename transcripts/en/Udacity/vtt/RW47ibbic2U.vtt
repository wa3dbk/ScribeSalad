00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.590
So how do you do this? Well, I'm pretty

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.540
lazy and my first reaction is always to try

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.650
to avoid the issue if possible. Remember, anything that

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.400
the browser is responsible for rasterizing it can probably do

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.830
at the native resolution of the screen. So if

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.900
you can effectively use vector graphics like scalable vector

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.630
graphics, or canvas to draw your graphics, You absolutely

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.970
should. Although I do want to note that by default,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.010
canvas has a backing store set to a 1x

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.030
pixel density. That is, it won't rasterize in higher

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.200
resolution on 2x or 3x displays. You can change

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.580
it and get a higher resolution backing store by setting

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.170
the width and height on the canvas to the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.600
upscale dimensions. Multiply them by device pixel ratio, then scale

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.220
your entire context, or use css width and height

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.070
to get it to lay out to the appropriate size.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.550
We don't do this automatically in the browser though,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.820
if we did, canvases on two x devices would cost

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.650
four times as much memory, and 3 x devices

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.510
with cost nine times as much memory. On mobile devices

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.200
that might have pretty limited memory to begin with.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.180
Now, for small icons or glyphs, you may wish to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.820
use icon fonts which are a handy way to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.530
get pretty looking icons that scale well. For general prettiness,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.610
using CSS features like gradients, rather than a gradient image is a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.570
radically good idea. And, CSS3 features like rounded corners and boarders. Save

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.090
you from having to supply custom graphics for each corner and they

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.380
have the added benefit of reducing the number of requests your page makes.
