Let's take a moment to process the speed doubling implications of computer

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.040
technology. Let's do that by comparing the speed of trains and of processors

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.270
between 1971, when the train speed record was 380

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.112
kilometers per hour. This was the French TGV train or as they say,

00:00:21.112 --> 00:00:26.170
[FOREIGN]. I will also tell you since 1971 until 2007,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.390
processor speed has doubled every two years on average over this time

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.660
period. So if train speed was doubling every two years between

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.410
71 and 2007, the train speed would have been in 2007.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.130
Put your answer here in kilometers per hour to make it easy.
