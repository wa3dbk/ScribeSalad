00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.630
Down here there's a message
informing the user about which item

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.010
they've chosen.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.260
In this case,
we haven't selected anything yet, so

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.850
it assumes we're starving and
tells us to pick something.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.010
If I pick something to eat
like strawberry pudding,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.500
the message changes to remind
me which item I've selected.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.529
Now how does Backbone
handle monitoring events?

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.960
In app.js we have a view for
the SelectedItem message.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.310
Just like before we get the template
from the DOM, convert it to a string,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.660
and pass it to underscore's
template function.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.640
These buttons are part
of a MenuItemView, and

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.209
that's where the button and the
SelectedItem message are wired together.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.220
This is where we set up the events for
each menu item.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.212
When something with a class
of SelectedItem is clicked,

00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:48.320
JavaScript will call the selectItem
function which is right here.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.620
Backbone creates a record of all
the events it needs to listen for.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.360
It keeps track of everything that needs
to happen when that event actually runs.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.450
And when the event occurs, it triggers
all the code that needs to run.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.600
We're going to look at Backbone's
on function in isolation,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.519
this way we can really
focus on how it works.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.200
Let's first create an empty object.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.789
Now we'll take this empty object and add
in all of Backbone's event functions.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.340
Since it has Backbone's on method,
I can now set up an event for

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.540
this object to listen for.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.890
Finally, I'll trigger that event and
pass it some data.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.680
Backbone took this string and
passed it to the callback function and

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.800
logged out this message.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.970
Let's dive into on and
see how it's doing this.
