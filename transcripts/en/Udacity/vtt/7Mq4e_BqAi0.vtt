00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.820
So thus far, what we've been doing is writing a lot of functions. We generally

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.360
start by creating an empty Python file.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.760
Let's call it some_module.py, in this case. And

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.840
then we add functions to it. Functions

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.678
like do.this. And another function, let's call it

00:00:18.678 --> 00:00:22.220
do.that, for instance. And, essentially what we're doing

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.360
is writing code, one line at a time.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.790
Almost like a recipe and frankly that technique's

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.940
been working for us thus far. So, let's

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.410
continue to use this technique while solving the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.200
next programming challenge which is building a movie website.
