00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.932
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In the last few quizzes, we figured out that if could get a quadratic

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:08.412
equation in this form right here, with two factors involving an x to the first

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:12.977
power multiplied together. Then we could pretty easily find out where its x

00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:17.732
intercepts are. Or where that parabola cuts the x axis. Awesome. Just to cement

00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:22.417
that idea, let's do one more practice example involving these concepts. Let's

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:27.137
say then, that we have the equation y equals x minus 4 times x plus 3. If I want

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:31.610
to find out, where this curve, intersects with the x axis, or in other words,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.334
where its x intercepts are, what equation do we need to solve? Please write your

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:41.018
answer in this box. Also, at this point, we don't need to multiply out anything,

00:00:41.018 --> 00:00:45.207
or simplify at all. This is really just a one step problem at this point.
