00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.550
It's important to note that many of the data sets that

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.670
we've used so far in this course are what I would

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.150
call tidy data sets. What I mean is that these data

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.250
sets were manipulated into a specified format of rows and columns.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.750
This is what allowed us to so easily import these data

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.570
sets into R. You should know that not all data sets

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.150
are going to be so nice. Sometimes, you may be pulling data

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.020
from different sources, like webpages, audio files, or even PDFs. Other

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.690
times, you may need to reshape or rearrange your data into

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.380
different formats. We're going to cover this later in lesson five. The

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.170
important thing to know is that this is a necessary step

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.310
prior to conducting EDA and it's called data munching. There are plenty

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.500
of tools for doing this kind of work, and if you're

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.650
interested in learning more about how to wrangle and adjust data,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.330
check out our data munching course. You can find a link

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.260
to it in the instructor notes. Now, this course EDA won't cover

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.360
data munching, but techniques for doing so are vital for any data scientist.
