00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now that we know how failure is going to be, let's look into how to systematically find our causes.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What we need is a way to organize the debugging process

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and for this, we use the process called the scientific method.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That's a cool name isn't it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's actually a big name for little thing but this little thing again has big consequences.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What the scientific method does is provide a systematic process

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
by turning some aspect of reality into a theory that explains how this aspect of reality works,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and that makes exact predictions on this reality.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let me come up with a simple example of how the scientific methods works.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Suppose your a human--say, Isaac Newton,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
your laying in your orchard and all of a sudden your watching an apple fall down.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So now you wonder, well I've just seen this apple falling. This is an aspect of reality.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Why do apples fall down?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What the scientific method does is provides you a way

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to come up with the most general prediction method available.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So you can think that if an apple falls and you can repeat this experiment over and over

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
by letting an apple fall, you may also think about well do bricks fall.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Here's a brick and lo and behold, it falls.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Do plates fall? Oh yes they do. Do cups fall down too? Oh yes they do.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Put yourself in the mind of a 3 year old and you will find that everything falls down,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and everything really means everything.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I can easily generalized that everything falls down.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Unless you happen to see a say--a balloon.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Here's the balloon and the lo and behold the balloon goes up.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So not everything falls down, but you can easily extend your theory

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to say--well a balloon is larger than air.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
If the air falls down, then the balloon must go up. So still everything falls down.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What does down actually means? Down means toward the center of the earth.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Everything is attracted towards the center of the earth.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Well, the sun is not attracted to the center of the earth. It's rather the other way around.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So you see that from these observations on even experiments that you can conduct,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
you will eventually be able to come up with a full pledge theory that explains

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
where things will be moving, that explains at which velocity they will be moving,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
which explains where the acceleration will be.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
In the case of Isaac Newton, then became the theory of gravitation.
