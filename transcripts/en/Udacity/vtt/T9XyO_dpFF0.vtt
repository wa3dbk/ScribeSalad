00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.574
The answer is, sometimes it will not remove enough friends. Let's trace through

00:00:04.574 --> 00:00:08.060
an example and talk about why. For this John example, in the for loop we start

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.530
with i is 0, i is less than the number of friends. The friend at position 0

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.040
doesn't like John, so we remove that friend. And now the indexes of the friends

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:28.926
change. Whereas before this was 0, 1, 2, 3. Now, it's 0, 1, 2. So we'll check

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:33.614
if the friend at position 1 likes John back. The person at position 1 is

00:00:33.614 --> 00:00:37.684
Jamesha, and Jamesha does like John back. So we skip over this, and come back

00:00:37.684 --> 00:00:42.637
up to the top of the loop. Now i is 2. So we check if friend 2 likes John back,

00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:46.684
friend 2 does like John back so we'll come back up to the top of the loop

00:00:46.684 --> 00:00:50.944
skipping the remove step and now i is 3 which is now less than the number of

00:00:50.944 --> 00:00:59.259
friends so we're done but Maria never got removed. After removing TJ, Maria's

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:04.670
index went from 1 to 0, but the counter in the loop went from 0 to 1. So we

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.564
never checked whether Maria should be removed or not. This code will sometimes

00:01:08.564 --> 00:01:11.680
skip friends and not check if they should be removed.
