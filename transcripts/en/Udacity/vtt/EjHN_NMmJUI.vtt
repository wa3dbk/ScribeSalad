00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.880
How are you going to deal with a question of heterogeneity? Some approaches

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.570
include standard APIs. Those standards come from organizations like W3C,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.260
that is the World Wide Web Consortium, OMG the Object Management Group which is

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.670
the promogater of GML, ANSI American National Standards Institute,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.340
international standards organization. All of these standard API's and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.800
protocols must at least address the issue of backward and forward compatibility.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.390
Backwards compatibility means if you've got a new version, does that

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.300
version support or break older versions. Tougher is forward compatibility.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.440
In your current version, are you promising that regardless of how the particular

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.160
standard may change in the future, that the current version will be supported.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.940
Second is the question of normative architectures.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.062
Here OMG is taking a stab with what they call Model-Driven Architecture, MDA,

00:00:57.062 --> 00:01:02.580
in which the parts of a systems architecture which are machine independent

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.288
are separated from the machine dependent parts. And then there is

00:01:06.288 --> 00:01:10.523
a co-generation process that enables the generation of the dependent parts from

00:01:10.523 --> 00:01:14.680
some kinds of machine descriptions. The major vendors or

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.086
players in the game also offer there own ways of dealing with heterogeneity. For

00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:24.868
example, Sony has its what originally was called J2E and is now called JEE.

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:29.080
Microsoft has .Net, IBM has Websphere and so on.
