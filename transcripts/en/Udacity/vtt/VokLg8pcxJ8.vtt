00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.910
When I first got to Google.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.670
I was trying to wrap up
on all things sysadmin.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.050
It was overwhelming.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.060
There were so many tools to learn so
many ways of doing the same thing.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.620
Luckily, I got to sit next to
Kelsey on a two hour bus ride.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.129
I started asking him questions I said,
Kelsey.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.080
I'm having information overload
there are so many tools out there.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.140
What should I learn, what's the fastest
way for me to become productive?

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.440
And he said there's only one rule
way to manage applications and

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.010
that's Kubernetes.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.160
And he spent the next two
hours showing me Kubernetes.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.290
After that I wasn't so
overwhelmed anymore.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.020
Kubernetes made sense to me because it
looked at containers at a higher level.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.190
It was an abstraction that made sense.
