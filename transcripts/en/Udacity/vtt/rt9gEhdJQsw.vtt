00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.166
Anthony can complete 1 3rd of the assignment in 1 hour's time. Great job if you

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.843
found this fraction. For Anthony we know it takes him 3 hours time to complete

00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:13.524
one assignment. So let's take his 3 hours and break it up into three equally

00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:19.830
spaced intervals. So in 1 hour, Anthony can complete 1 3rd of his job. And the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.480
2nd hour, he completes another 3rd of his job bringing the total up to 2 3rds.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.196
And the last hour, Anthony finishes his job, which would be 1 or 3 3rds. This

00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:34.136
is how we know is Anthony only is allowed to work for 1 hour, he completes a

00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:37.174
3rd of the job in that hour assuming he's working at the same rate the entire

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:39.180
time.
