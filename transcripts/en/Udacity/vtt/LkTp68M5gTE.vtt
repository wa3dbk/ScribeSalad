00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
To provide a test network for looking at shortest path problems, I downloaded from the Internet

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a social network, as it were, of marvel comic book characters.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's a lot like the IMDB data and that there's sort of people

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and they are linked together if they appear together in a sort of movie,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but in the comic book world, we're talking about something more like superhero characters

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in which particular comic books they both appeared in.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So for example, Spiderman at least in this set here, Spiderman appeared in a comic book

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
called COC 1 and also in one called MaxSec 3 and Thor and Hulk also appeared in MaxSec 3.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So path in this network are kind of like paths in the Kevin Dating Game and that you go from

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.000
say Black Widow to COC 1 to Spiderman to MaxSec to Thor

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
cause in this set, Thor and Black Widow are not directly connected.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
No that's not true. Here's the path.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So again you can play kind of like the Kevin Dating Game except it's kind of a Spiderman game.
