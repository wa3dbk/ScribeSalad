All right. I'm here at Mozilla with Steve Fink, who has worked on regular expressions

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and languages and parsing, just-in-time transformation and optimizations for Mozilla

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and other opensource projects.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I was wondering are there any times where you've used regular expressions in the real world?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
[Steve Fink:] Yeah. Just yesterday I was at the grocery store, and I could not find the sugar shelf.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Sorry, that was a dream. Let's cancel that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So we have been having a problem recently on the Firefox browser

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
where we get periodic stalls.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Often this is some event that happened--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
a key press, a timer fires off, something like that.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We take 100 milleseconds or something to service it.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I pulled out my standard tools, which are Perl, regular expressions,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and I wrote a little script.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's like one regular expression to identify that this is a class declaration

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and another one to find what an error is from,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
another one to find a run method, which has to exist on all these,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which just gives me a good place to stick my code in. And it kind of worked.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That's one example where I've done this. I tend to do this fairly often. &gt;&gt;Excellent.
