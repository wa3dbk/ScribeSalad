00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.990
Streams are another popular form of connector. They're primarily concerned with

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.761
data transfer, that is communication services. Common examples include pipes

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:16.515
TCP sockets and proprietary client-server type protocols. Some of the possible

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:21.254
variations available with stream connectors include delivery guarantees.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:25.066
Whether the stream itself is bounded, that is, it only has a certain capacity or

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:29.236
whether it's unbounded and whether it's capable of buffering the information.

00:00:29.236 --> 00:00:35.080
What its units of transmission are, that is, is it bytes or

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.410
is it something more higher order, more structured? Is it stateful or

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.690
stateless? Is it named or unnamed? Is it available only locally or

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.500
is it, is it more remote? Synchronous or asynchronous or timed? Law or

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.410
structured? And what's the cardinality? That is, is it definitely a one to

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.480
one type connection or might there be multiple receivers? Or might it

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.350
even be end to end where there are multiple riders and multiple receivers?
