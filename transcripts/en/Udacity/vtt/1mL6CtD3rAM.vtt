00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Before we're done with localization, I'd like to talk about robot motion.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Suppose we have a distribution over those cells--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
such as this one: 1/9, 1/3, 1/3, 1/9, and 1/9--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and even though we don't know where the robot is,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the robot moves, and it moves to the right.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In fact, the way we're going to program is we will assume the world is cyclic,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
so if it drops off the right-most cell it finds itself in the left-most cell.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Suppose we know for a fact the world moved exactly 1 grid cell to the right,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
including the cyclic motion.

00:00:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Can you tell me for all these 5 values, what the posterior probability is after that motion?
