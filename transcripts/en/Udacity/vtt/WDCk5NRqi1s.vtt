00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.019
Let's look at what each side of each of these equations simplifies to, to

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.850
figure out which equations are true. How about we start with this equation up

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.840
here. And let's go with the left hand side first. Inside the parentheses here,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.420
we have 100 times 1000 which is 100,000, or 10 to the 5th power That means that

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.780
this side of the equation is equal to log base 10 of 10 to the 5th, and we know

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.822
that that is just equal to 5. Great. Now, on the other side we have log base 10

00:00:28.822 --> 00:00:34.394
of 100 plus log base 10 of 1000. So, this is the same as log base 10 of 10

00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:40.460
squared. Plus log based ten of ten cubed. That's just two plus three, or five.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.750
So, this equation does check out. This side is equal to this side, which means

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.060
it is a true statement. Awesome. Let's go for our second one. We know that log

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.990
based ten of 100 is 2 and we know that log based ten of 1,000 is three. So that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.820
means that this side is equal to 2 times 3 or 6. Now over here, we're adding

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.420
those two numbers we just multiplied. Log base 10 of 100, plus log base10 of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.870
1000, as we saw on this side, is just equal to 2 plus 3, or 5. 6 is not equal

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.030
to 5, so this is not a true statement. And our third equation, finally. On the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.570
left hand side we have log based 10 of 1,100. Let's see using our calculator,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.414
what that equals. Log of 1,100 equals 3.04139 and so on. Let's write that down,

00:01:28.414 --> 00:01:32.880
I'll just write some of the numbers, we know that it's rounded on the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.450
calculator anyway. On to the right hand side. Now notice that this expression

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.690
is exactly the same as the one we already evaluated. On the left-hand side of

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.793
the previous equation. So we know that this, log base 10 of 100 times log base

00:01:46.793 --> 00:01:53.860
10 of 1,000, equals 6. Now, 3.04 anything is not equal to six, so this equation

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.680
is not true either. The first equation we had is the only example of the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.270
product property being used properly. The two numbers that we multiplied and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.470
then plugged in as the input of our first log expression, each act as the

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.800
inputs for these separate logs over here that are then added together. We have

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.650
to be super careful about which numbers are multiplying and which quantities

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.271
we're adding when we use the product property. Great job.
