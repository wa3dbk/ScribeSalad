00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer happens to be no.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If I draw the original blue data points, the data is indeed linear,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but this data point over here of a house of size 2100 square feet

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
sold remarkably cheap, so we get the point right over here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Similarly, the house of size 1300 square feet sold for a lot.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Both of these data points are outliers.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We'll talk about outliers later.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There is clearly no way to fit a linear function through all those data points.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I would even question that this wicked kind of function that I drew is a good

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
accurate representation of the relationship between size and price.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You would not expect that as you go south of 1500 square feet

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that the price would rapidly increase and then decrease again

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
because there is likely nothing special about small houses than justifies the price over here.
