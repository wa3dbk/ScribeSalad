After the demo I would like to have a little quiz

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.430
about the extract method refactoring. And I would like to ask you

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.910
when is it appropriate to apply the extract method refactoring. Here I

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.890
have a set of possible scenarios. First one is when there is

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.730
duplicated code in two or more methods. When a class is too

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.730
large. When the names of two classes are too similar. Or when

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.840
a method is highly coupled with a class other than the one

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.370
where it is defined. So as usual, please mark all that apply.
