00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.622
Okay, so this is pretty straightforward.

00:00:01.622 --> 00:00:06.196
The output at any particular element is the sum of that element

00:00:06.196 --> 00:00:09.624
and all elements that come before it in the current segment.

00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:12.509
But we're starting it over at every segment boundary.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.792
So 12, for instance, is the sum of 3, 4, and 5 but nothing from the previous segment.

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:19.841
We're not going to go through how this is implemented,

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:22.667
but it's a terrific exercise to work out on your own,

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:25.687
whether you do it with Hillis and Steele scan or the Blelloch scan.

00:00:25.687 --> 00:00:29.846
It has the same complexity as unsegmented scan, but it runs a little slower

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:32.409
because you have to keep track of the segments along the way.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.602
So it requires more memory traffic as well as more complex computation.

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:40.562
We'll have to put a little more information about the implementation of segmented scan

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:42.429
in the supplementary materials.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:45.720
But again, this is a really great problem for you to work out on your own.
