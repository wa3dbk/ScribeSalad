00:00:00.074 --> 00:00:04.943
Conceptually map and transpose are 1-to-1. Each input maps to a single unique output.

00:00:04.943 --> 00:00:10.143
You can think of a gather operation as many-to-1. Many possible inputs can be chosen to compute an output.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.845
In this terminology, scatter is 1-to-many,

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:16.373
so each thread chooses from many possible output destinations.

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:21.191
Stencil can be seen as a specialized gather that pulls output from a select few inputs

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:25.188
in a given neighborhood of the output. So you might turn that to several-to-1.

00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:29.534
In the next lecture John will tell you about 2 more really fundamental patterns.

00:00:29.534 --> 00:00:34.269
Reduce could be turned all-to-one. For example if you're adding up all the numbers in an array.

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.297
Finally scan and sort can be considered all-to-all because

00:00:37.297 --> 00:00:40.456
all of the input can affect the destination of the resulting output.

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:43.286
You'll learn more about these in the next lectures.
