00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
Congratulations. This is really impressive.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.090
You've gotten all the way through the course.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.150
The only thing left is the final, and good luck on that.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.890
Now I'd like to ask you to challenge us to improve this course.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.890
We'd like your help with that.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.830
We'd like you to tell us how you think that we can improve this course,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.340
and what other topics in theoretical computer science you would like to learn about.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.350
We have a link to a survey that we'd really appreciate it if you took,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.540
down below the video in the instructor comments.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.740
Once you've taken this survey go ahead and check this box,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.320
and then good luck on the final.

00:00:35.320 --> 99:59:59.000
Once again I'd like to thank you for being a part of this course.
