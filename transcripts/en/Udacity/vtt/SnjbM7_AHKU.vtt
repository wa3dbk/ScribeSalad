In the previous lesson, we learned about the words and, and or and intersections

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:08.307
and unions. And was for an intersection and or was for a union. We're going to

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:12.402
use this knowledge for compound inequalities. Let's see how these ideas play

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:16.597
out. For a compound inequality, we don't just have one inequality, we have two.

00:00:16.692 --> 00:00:20.792
Between each compound inequality, we'll have the word and or, or. This one has

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:25.173
and. So, for this first skills check, I want you to solve each inequality and

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:29.208
write your answer in these boxes. Then, we're going to look at how to diagram

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.929
the solution.
