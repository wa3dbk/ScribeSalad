00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.043
Now let's go see all this in action with Dr.Zelicks and Callie the sea lion.

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:09.496
&gt;&gt; This is Carlie. Callie, can you wave hi? Good! Can you wave with the other

00:00:09.496 --> 00:00:16.671
hand? Good, good. Here at Moss Landing Green Laboratories, we run a teaching

00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:25.550
aquarium for students, can we salute? Good. From all over the world. The

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.650
beginning of the foundation of the relationship that I have with Carlie is

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.842
basic obedience. Water. Good. So I put her in the water when I ask. Hold. I can

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:43.270
ask her to wait there patiently for me. And the reason that she's willing to do

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.855
these things is because of the reinforcement history of

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:46.460
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.856
conditioning that I have used to form these basic behaviors. The second basic

00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:55.122
behavior that I have used all the time is one of the basic

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:55.903
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:55.903 --> 00:01:05.482
training techniques and it's called targeting good. This is a nose target. And

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:09.900
Carlie is trained to put her nose to my hand. Wherever I put my hand, Carlie's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.849
nose is going to go. Good. And she stops targeting when she hears that sound

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:20.790
that I make which is called a bridge. A bridge is a stimulus that tells the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.434
animal they've done something correctly, and reinforcement is coming. There's a

00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:29.320
type of secondary reinforcer, a conditioned reinforcer which helps the animal

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.916
understand the reinforcement is on its way, without having to deliver the

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:39.595
reinforcement at that very second. Carllie is receiving a variety of different

00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:43.382
types of reinforcers. That right there is an ice cube, which she's been

00:01:43.382 --> 00:01:47.395
conditioned to like. And we've conditioned her to like it by association with

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:53.474
other things that she already likes. Including, the fish. And then there's also

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:57.780
her relationship with me. This is tactile reinforcement that she has to be

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.746
trained to enjoy. Yes! Don't stop! Yes! Don't stop! One of the things that

00:02:06.746 --> 00:02:10.508
comes from being associated with reinforcement for a long period of time is the

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:16.137
relationship. Through classical conditioning by associating myself with all

00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:20.421
good experiences for her, I have a strong value to her, I have more value than

00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:25.783
the food has. And we're demonstrating that right now because the food is over

00:02:25.783 --> 00:02:30.154
there and she and I are right here together. That's what can be formed with a

00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:34.628
long history of partnership. Yes? Good! Alright
