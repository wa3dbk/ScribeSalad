00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.900
Starting with the top red box, it looks like it takes up the entire row and

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.630
contains a few elements inside of it.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.010
So, this one's going to be row.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.430
Let's look at the top blue box.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.800
It contains a name and

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.940
title, and it looks like it's taking up about half of this whole row.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.150
As a result, I'm going to put column 6.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.670
However, this box could be larger than 6 wide.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.140
Because the text is right aligned, if this box were over here, or

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.620
if it expanded over here, it'd still look the same.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.950
So your answer could be larger than column 6, but

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.450
it's definitely no larger than column 10.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.340
For the bottom red box, it's taking up the entire row and

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.050
it contains some columns inside of it, so, once again we have a row.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.950
And then for the bottom blue box here, it's taking up a third of this row.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.205
A third of twelve is four, so this is going to be column 4.
