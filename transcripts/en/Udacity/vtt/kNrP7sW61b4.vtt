00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
If you play around a bit with this algorithm what you will see is this.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.890
Each time that this loop here runs, it puts at least 1 of the vertices from

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.890
the minimum vertex cover into its solution.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.880
So the correct answer is this. Let me illustrate this.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.430
If you take any edge here, so the algorithm starts out fresh, and you take any edge

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.240
from this graph, it's impossible to take an edge where not at least 1 of the points

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.470
is in the minimum vertex cover.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.480
Say we take this edge here, then "Take 2" would put these 2 vertices here into its solution,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.600
and 1 of those vertices is actually part of the minimum vertex cover.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.680
Or if the "Take 2" algorithm say uses this edge here, then we even have a better case,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.700
because both of the vertices that it now chooses to be part of its solution,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.920
are actually also part of a optimum solution. And this works for all edges.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.620
No matter what edge you choose here, you will always have at least 1 endpoint

00:00:54.620 --> 99:59:59.000
that is part of a minimum vertex cover.
