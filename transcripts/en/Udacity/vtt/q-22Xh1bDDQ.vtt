And of course a key with sorting is that the output is in order and

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.190
in particular here we're concerned with ascending order, and

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.270
Jerred tried to indicate what that means by talking about the values

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.060
at particular positions with respect to the position that comes after them.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.480
In the output vector. And we had to make a special case concerning the,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.070
the last element. because it doesn't have anything that comes after it.
