Humans consume many drugs for the psychoactive effects that they have on us.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.942
Here we're going to discuss drugs that are potentially abused, as opposed to

00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:12.240
drugs that are used as medicines, such as something for high blood pressure.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.486
Some have argued that humans have a basic need to cope with their daily lives,

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:21.728
and that some people do so by using drugs. There are four main reasons why

00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:27.046
people use drugs. The first is for recreational purposes. Here an individual

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:32.162
may use a drug to experiment or to have fun. Another reason is for social

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:36.196
purposes. Here an individual may take a drug because it makes them feel like

00:00:36.196 --> 00:00:39.332
they can interact better and socialize, or they may take it for peer pressure

00:00:39.332 --> 00:00:41.210
purposes.
