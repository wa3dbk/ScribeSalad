00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.379
Let's talk about the different kinds of communication,

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:05.009
the different patterns of communication you'll see in parallel computing.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.836
And as you'll see, this is really all about how to map tasks and memory together--

00:00:09.836 --> 00:00:11.915
how to map tasks, which are threads in CUDA,

00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:14.684
and the memory that they're communicating through.

00:00:14.684 --> 00:00:17.688
The communication pattern you've already seen is called map.

00:00:17.688 --> 00:00:20.302
Now with map, you've got many data elements

00:00:20.302 --> 00:00:24.799
such as elements of an array, or entries in a matrix, or pixels in an image,

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:29.899
And you're going to do the same function or computational on each piece of data.

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.404
This means each task is going to read from and write to a specific place in memory.

00:00:34.404 --> 00:00:37.772
There's a 1 to 1 correspondence between input and output.

00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:40.651
So map is very efficient on GPUs,

00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:43.409
and it's easily expressed in an efficient way in CUDA

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.515
by simply having 1 thread do each task, but this isn't a very flexible framework.

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:50.350
There's many things you can't do with a simple map operation.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.744
Now suppose that you want each thread to compute and store the average

00:00:53.744 --> 00:00:55.915
across a range of data elements.

00:00:55.915 --> 00:01:00.610
Say maybe we want to average each set of 3 elements together.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.488
In this case, each thread is going to read the values from 3 locations in memory

00:01:04.488 --> 00:01:07.722
and write them into a single place and so on.

00:01:07.722 --> 00:01:10.060
Or suppose you want to blur an image

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.897
by setting each pixel to the average of its neighboring pixels,

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:18.501
so that this pixel would average together the values of all 5 of these pixels,

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:21.705
and then let's take this pixel next to it,

00:01:21.705 --> 00:01:26.307
would average together the values of all these pixels and so on.

00:01:26.307 --> 00:01:29.218
We'll do exactly this kind of blurring operation in the homework assignment

00:01:29.218 --> 00:01:31.387
that's coming up at the end of this lecture.

00:01:31.387 --> 00:01:35.715
This operation is called a gather, because each calculation gathers input data elements together

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:39.799
from different places to compute an output result.
