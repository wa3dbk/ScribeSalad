00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.140
Alright, here's what I did. I filled up the car with 20 gallons. And I drove

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.888
100 miles. I printed out the amount a gas in the tank. An then I need to print

00:00:07.888 --> 00:00:11.673
out the expected value. Well that's the hard part. Let's see what I expect. I

00:00:11.673 --> 00:00:17.730
drove 100 miles. I assume, 50 miles per gallon. That means, two gallons

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.012
consumed. I started out with 20 gallons, I consumed two so I should have 18

00:00:24.012 --> 00:00:31.890
gallons left over, let's put that in and try it out. Here is the result, the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.670
actual gas left is 18 gallons and the expected value is 18 so, everything was

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.710
working great.
