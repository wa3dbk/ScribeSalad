We all get feedback sometimes,
and so does your app.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.570
Take these reviews seriously.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.860
They're a pretty clear view
into the mind of your users.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.373
When you're developing your
app you can be so close to it,

00:00:10.373 --> 00:00:13.160
that it can be hard to step back and
see the forest for the trees.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.900
You might also be so in love with your
app that you ignore some of the things

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.530
that don't work so well.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.560
It's an easy pit to fall into.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.030
Now once you launch your app,
listening to your reviews and

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.630
feedback is a perfect opportunity
to iterate and revise, so

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.640
you can make your app even
better than it was before.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.750
Use the feedback to improve the app,
and make your user happy,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.740
because ratings
are incredibly important.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.310
Highly rated apps generates
significantly more in sales.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.720
Three and
four star rated apps are nine times more

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.270
successful than two and three star apps.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.610
And four and five star rated apps
are four times more successful than

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.890
three and four star rated apps.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.210
And don't forget to respond
to your users feedback and

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.180
reviews, this is going to help
your users feel more engaged, and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.750
it's going to keep you connected to
the most important person, the customer.
