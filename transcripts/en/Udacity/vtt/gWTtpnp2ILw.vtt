00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.439
We talked about the when of
adaptive design, specifically,

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:09.384
choosing breakpoints, and
using resource qualifiers, like w600dp.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:13.720
And we also touched on what we
want to fix at these breakpoints.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.740
Let's now get into the how of
implementing adaptive design on Android.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.358
&gt;&gt; Now the simplest to adapt your UI,

00:00:21.358 --> 00:00:25.977
is to create a separate
layout in res/layout-w600dp.

00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:29.288
You'll probably end up copying and
pasting a bunch of layout XML code,

00:00:29.288 --> 00:00:33.120
because your layouts probably
won't be completely different.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.000
For example, here you can see
the basic layout is a top bar,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.460
with a collection below it, and
it's the same in this tablet layout.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.440
This approach of simply copying and
pasting

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.570
will quickly lead to a maintenance
problem with your code, where you'll

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.129
need to make the same changes in
lots of different layout XML files.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.270
Now, you could, instead,
just vary your subsection of the layout,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.730
using layout includes.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.300
Layout includes are, basically,
a way of saying, hey, right here,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.560
at this point in my layout, insert
the contents of this other layout.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.040
In this example, the list view
portion of the UI is in an include.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.630
The nice thing is that the container
layout, and the included layout,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.880
can each vary individually,
using resource qualifiers.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.590
So in this code, we're saying, when
the width of the screen ins over 600dp,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.830
change the included layout to this one.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.660
That layout can be better optimized for

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.730
tablet's, such as using a grid,
instead of a list.
