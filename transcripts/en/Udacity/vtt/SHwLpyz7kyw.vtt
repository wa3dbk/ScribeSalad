00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.790
So, those are examples of precondition.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.980
There's another one.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.840
Think for a second and

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.830
see if you can come up with one
other potential precondition.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.560
&gt;&gt; So, for the last requirement, you
could be in a situation where someone

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.230
continually is trying to check out the
same vulnerable item over and over again

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.660
and one of our requirements states
that you can renew an item once once.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.210
But, if there is another
outstanding request for

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.530
that item, then you shouldn't be allowed
to check it out because other people may

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.390
be wanting to check out the same thing.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.090
&gt;&gt; We're talking about
checking out an item.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.030
And if you've all ready got it checked
out and you want to keep it longer,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.815
that's a renewal, not a check out.

00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:45.150
&gt;&gt; But clearly, we're going to

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.030
have to deal with that situation
when we get to considering renewals.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.900
&gt;&gt; So, the other possibility is
you'd like to check this out, but

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.350
it turns out that it's
the hottest bestseller,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.520
and there's 44 people before
you in the list of requests.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.388
&gt;&gt; So
even though you happened to find it,

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:07.370
because it was just put back,
it was put back by mistake and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.810
they're not going to let check it out
because somebody else has requested it.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.350
&gt;&gt; So, the request queue needs to be
empty so to speak for you to be able to.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.720
&gt;&gt; Well, almost.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.570
How about if you're
the person that requested it?

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.460
&gt;&gt; If you're the first
person that requested,

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.010
then the precondition should hold and-
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.800
&gt;&gt; Execute.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.410
&gt;&gt; It's not am empty queue.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.400
It could be a queue with one
thing in it or a queue actually

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.290
with any number of things in it as
long as you're top on the list.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.100
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.600
&gt;&gt; Okay.
