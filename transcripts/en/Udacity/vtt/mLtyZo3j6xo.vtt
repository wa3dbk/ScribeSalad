00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.440
Our portrait forecast view
looks pretty good now.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.470
The next code you're going to grab will
transform the landscape tablet view from

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.910
this, into this.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.920
Let's go over how we
accomplish this change.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.900
First of all, you can see that we've
added a linear layout for the app bar,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.359
which has the correct elevation and
blue primary color background.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.670
Next, we see the toolbar,
rendered with the correct themes.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.580
This is a bit interesting.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.680
We want to align the Sunshine
logo with the forecast day.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.540
Rather than hard coding
the calculated value,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.660
we use nested frame
layouts to perform it.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.690
This is a tiny bit expensive but

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.160
it makes it easy to create
responsive layouts.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.140
Finally, we look into how we
position the detail view.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.900
This is a nice trick for creating two
even columns in a relative layout.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.370
Create a center strut view that
has no width or height and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.230
ask relative lay out to center the view.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.815
We can then create the forecast fragment
view to the left of this strut view and

00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:07.190
a detailed fragment to the right
of the center strut view.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.120
Note that we have to make sure that
the lay out elevation at least

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.670
matches the app bar.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.420
Otherwise the detailed fragment
would be included by the at

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.640
bar rather then overlapping it and
that's it.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.750
It's actually a relatively
simple relative layout,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.010
given how complex it looks.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.190
Let's take a quick look on where
the portrait tablet layout stands.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.010
Yikes, it's worse than before.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.880
We can fix it.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.370
Here are our red lines for what we
want the portrait layout to look like.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.770
Wow, these overlapping red
lines are a bit confusing.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.990
We can bring the app bar
forward to analyze it.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.000
So, our app bar will be
made in three sections.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.015
The top section is our tool bar
with a height of action bar size.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:55.767
Image, with a height of
listPreferredItemHeight, and

00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:58.402
the bottom section is our spacer view,
with a height of

00:01:58.402 --> 00:02:02.345
details_app_bar_overlap, which
we've just added for you.

00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:07.595
We use our standard 16 DP padding
around the details fragment, and

00:02:07.595 --> 00:02:10.763
for our details fragment, we're
actually going to use wrap_contents.
