00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.035
Here's our fourth problem with the Pythagorean Theorem. See if you can solve

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:08.252
it, and find each of the side legs for our right triangle. Think carefully as

00:00:08.252 --> 00:00:12.470
you set up the expressions, because this one's tough. Take your time, and be

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.366
sure to check your answers in the end. Good luck.
