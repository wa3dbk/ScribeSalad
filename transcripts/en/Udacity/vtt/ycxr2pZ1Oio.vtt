As always we want to start by looking for our greatest common factor. And yes

00:00:03.562 --> 00:00:09.345
indeed, there is one. It's 5. We take up the 5, leaving us with x squared minus

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:14.344
4y squared. I can see that this line is really a greatest common factor times a

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:19.715
squared minus b squared. Our a is x and our b is 2y. So here's our final answer.

00:00:19.716 --> 00:00:25.493
5 times x plus 2y, times x minus 2y. This is our factored form.
