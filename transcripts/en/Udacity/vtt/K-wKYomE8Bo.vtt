00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
All right. Welcome to the final exam.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.850
Let's go ahead and start off with some questions about P vs NP.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.020
So, I'd like you to check the boxes here for the statements that you think are true.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.960
First, if any problem in NP is polynomial-time solvable, then P = NP.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.220
The second question is if any problem in NP provably requires

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.130
exponential time to solve, then P ≠ NP.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.790
And finally, if P ≠ NP, then some problems solvable in polynomial time

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.810
on a nondeterministic RAM will require exponential time to solve on a deterministic RAM.

00:00:38.810 --> 99:59:59.000
So, please check all that are true.
