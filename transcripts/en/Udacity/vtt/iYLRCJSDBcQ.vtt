00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.150
A single page application
is a self-contained page

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.270
that has its own user interface and
logic.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.080
It can talk to the server to send and

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.430
receive data,
then store that data locally.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.000
You can immediately interact with
the data by modifying, deleting or

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.780
creating new content.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.850
It's fast and there are no page reloads.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.270
You've already played
around with TodoMVC, but

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.600
I want to quickly focus on this MVC.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.310
What is it?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.320
MVC stands for Model, View, Controller
and its a common design pattern for

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.540
organizing software of any
kind including web apps.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.460
Many frameworks provide a means for
creating and managing models, views and

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.100
controllers.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.330
Model refers to a data model.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.000
It's everything from the user
information to any data that you

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.480
might want to see.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.070
View is what users see and
interact with.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.240
For a web site, the view is
essentially any HTML, CSS and

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.650
JavaScript that controls how
a page looks and behaves.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.220
Last is the controller,
this is the brain of your application.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.990
It sits between the model and
the view and

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.790
is in charge of passing
data between them.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.210
It contains all the templating logic,
routing logic and

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.430
anything else that
makes your app unique.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.880
If you want a refresher on MVC, I highly
recommend checking out our course,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.650
JavaScript Design Patterns or
the link in the instructor notes.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980
Okay, now back to TodoMVC.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.060
When I add this item as a new task,
I'm interacting with the apps of U, but

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.890
the controller is watching this and
is saving what I enter to the model.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.470
We've looked at single page applications
in action and looked at a common way to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.100
architect them, but
how do frameworks fit into this?
