00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.010
So, L3 Microkernel shares to debunk the myth about Microkernel-based

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.700
operating system structure. It goes beyond that, and it has a thesis for

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.960
how operating systems should be structured. The first

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.980
principle advocated by L3 is that the Microkernel should

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.550
have minimal abstractions that includes support for address

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.308
spaces, threads, interprocess communication,

00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:35.360
and generating unique IDs. Why do we need these abstractions in

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.480
the microkernel? The argument is that these four abstractions

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.280
that I mentioned, address space, threads, IPC, and

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.810
UID, Our extractions that are needed by any subsystem that

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.710
provides a functionality for end users in an operating system and therefore,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.330
the principle of optimizing the common

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.850
case suggests that these abstractions should be

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.430
part of any microkernel. The second

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.890
thesis coming out of L3 microkernel experience

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.370
is that microkernels are process specific

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.860
in implementation. In other words, if you

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.270
want an efficient implementation of microkernel, you have to take advantage of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.650
whatever the hardware is offering you. Which suggests that micro kernels by the

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.210
very nature are non-portable if you want to focus on performance. Making a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.890
micro kernel processor independent is essentially

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.070
sacrificing performance. So if you put these

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.730
two principles together, what L3 is advocating is the right set of

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.010
kernel abstractions and processor-specific implementation. If you do

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.090
that, then you can build efficient processor-independent

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.630
abstractions at the upper layers. All of the services

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.800
that we associate in a monolithic kernel like

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.930
a UNIX operating system such as,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.650
file system, network protocols, scheduling, memory

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.480
management. They all can be implemented in a processor independent way on top

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.030
of a microkernel that provides the right set of abstractions and exploits

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.370
whatever the hardware gives in terms

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.040
of capabilities to get an efficient processor

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.100
specific implementation. That's the thesis of

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.020
L3 microkernel, processor specific kernel and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.580
process the independent abstractions at higher

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.560
layers of the operating system stack.
