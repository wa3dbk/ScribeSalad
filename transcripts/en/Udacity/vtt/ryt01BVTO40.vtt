00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.020
Right now, we have material sliding
through material on the same elevation,

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.510
which is something the spec frowns upon.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.580
What we'd like to do is
something more like this.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.020
As you can see, the app bar gains
in elevation, casts a shadow,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.500
when the content slides under.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.430
Fortunately, we have a callback for
when the RecyclerView is scrolling.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.170
I just realized there might be a small
percentage of you that would feel

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.850
intellectually compromised if you
didn't get to implement this effect.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.668
This is your chance to
pause the video and

00:00:32.668 --> 00:00:35.143
attempt to do it yourself
before I show you the answer.

00:00:35.143 --> 00:00:41.241
Okay, last chance, and here goes.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.880
Here's how I did this.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.720
Inside of onCreateView,
right after our parallax stuff,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.790
I checked to see we have an app bar.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.310
If we have one,
I start by setting its elevation to 0.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.830
I then I add an OnScrollListener here.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.870
And whenever we scroll it we check
the vertical offset of the RecyclerView.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.320
If it's zero then we know
we're not underscrolled and

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.400
we set the app bar elevation to zero.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.350
Otherwise, we're underscrolled and we
actually set it to its TargetElevation,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.390
which is something that app
bars do that's kind of cool.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.460
And with that,
we get this nice underscrolling effect.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.410
It's a little hard to see
on the tablet perhaps, but

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.730
there's actually a little shadow
there you can see that's being cast.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.890
It's a subtle detail, but once again,
I always say when we're doing these

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.130
final steps, it's that last 10% that
really makes an enormous difference.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.294
And sometimes, it's the last 1%.
