00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:04.040
So, the multi-level page table
still looks at the virtual address

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.939
in terms of page offset and
page number, but

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:13.510
instead of using the entire page number
to access one huge table, it partitions

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.230
the page number into the so-called inner
page number, and the outer page number.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.910
The outer page number
tells us which part

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.520
of the larger page table
we would be using.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.400
The inner part tells us, which specific
entry in that large page table we

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.780
would be using,
instead of having the large page table,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.890
the outer page number is now used
to index into the outer page table.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.100
And each entry in the outer page table,
tells us where to find the so

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.020
called inner page table.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.180
Once we find the inner page table.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.745
We take the inner page number, and use
it to index into the inner page table.

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:58.370
And what we find there,
is the actual frame number to access.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.890
Another entry in the outer page table

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.510
will point to a different
inner page table.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.060
So pretty much what we have
is the outer page table

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.100
tells us which of the small
inner page tables to use.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.790
And the inner page table tells us
in where each of the page tables we

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.150
need to look at.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.040
So it seems like this is just a more
complicated way to access the page

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.630
table, but still for
every possible page number,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.340
we will have a frame number in
one of the inner page tables.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.080
The total size of the inner page tables,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.850
will be the size of
the original flat page table.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.630
And we still have added the outer page
table, which we didn't have before.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.170
So, pretty much, we still have
the same number of entries total here.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.380
And we have added something.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.790
So, where are the savings?
