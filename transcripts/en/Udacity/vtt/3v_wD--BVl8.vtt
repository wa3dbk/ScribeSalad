00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.780
Now, we're going to switch gears and move to a different catagory of mental

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.826
disorders. And those are disssociative disorders. These disorders produce

00:00:07.826 --> 00:00:13.177
extreme disruptions or gaps in memory, identity, or consciousness. In the DSM 5

00:00:13.177 --> 00:00:18.619
puts them in their own category. This is a condition in which cognitive

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.030
processes are disjointed and fragmented. This disorder often stems from

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.835
exposure to trauma or extreme stress. And even physical or sexual assault that

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:34.206
occurs. And it's most likely to occur during childhood. Individuals with

00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:38.691
dissociative identity disorder will develop at least two separate, independent

00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:44.130
identities. Now this used to be called multiple personality disorder. These

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.236
individuals experience two or more distinct personality states amnesia and self

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:54.178
destructive behaviors. Here, a person may find themselves at a hotel and not

00:00:54.178 --> 00:00:58.780
remember how they got there. They may injure themselves or not be able to

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.944
remember a particular experience in their life. This is reportedly due to the

00:01:03.944 --> 00:01:09.312
fact that the other personality is the one engaging in these behaviors. This

00:01:09.312 --> 00:01:13.990
disorder is another example of a position that psychologists disagree on. Some

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.425
psychologists don't agree that this is an actual diagnosis. Some even suggest

00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:24.516
that the separate personalities are ultimately produced by the therapist. So we

00:01:24.516 --> 00:01:27.918
see here that some psychologist state that this is a real disorder, and some

00:01:27.918 --> 00:01:32.035
state that it's not. Now let's go back to Susan, to talk about disorders that

00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:34.030
affect the body, and the mind.
