Alright. The common denominator is going to be 24. Here's how we can figure that

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:11.900
out. I can start by listing my denominators, and then I can list the multiples

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:17.640
of 6 and the multiples of 8. So, I have 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36. For 8, I have

00:00:17.652 --> 00:00:23.443
16, 24, 32, and 40. I can see that the lowest common number is 24. Both 6 and 8

00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:28.059
go into 24. Here's what it would look like if you use the factor tree method. I

00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:32.567
know the common factors for 6 and 8 are 2, and that the other factor of 6 is 3,

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:37.271
because 3 times 2 is 6. For 8, the other factor has to be 4. I know this because

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:41.766
2 times 4 is 8. If I multiply these factors together, I get 3 times 2, which is

00:00:41.778 --> 00:00:46.454
6, times 4 which is 24. Hopefully, you're getting the hang of finding the common

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.216
denominator.
