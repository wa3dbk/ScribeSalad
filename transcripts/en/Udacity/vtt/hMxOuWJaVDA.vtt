00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.580
Throughout this rest of this lesson, you'll learn to interact with pandas and

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.210
numpy using this medal count data from the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.850
We have the 26 countries who medal at least once, and how many gold,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.340
silver, bronze, and total medals they earned during the Sochi Olympics.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.940
Create a pandas dataframe called Olympics_medal_counts_df containing the data

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.810
from the table of 2014 Sochi winter Olympics medal counts.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.510
The columns for

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.090
this dataframe should be called country name, gold, silver and bronze.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.300
There is no need to specify row indices for this dataframe.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.080
In this case, the rows will automatically be assigned numbered indexes.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.050
Your code should go here
