00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.140
I'll open up Chrome Dev tools emulator,
and

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.520
look at a mobile view of
the web fundamentals site.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.430
I'll open Chrome,
navigate to Web Fundamentals,

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.990
then open the Chrome Developer Tools,
using Cmd+Option+J, or Control+Alt+J.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.460
Next, I'll hit the emulator button.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.600
It's that phone looking
icon in the toolbar.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.900
Great, the emulator is ready to go.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.710
I can start loading pages and
see how they look.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.870
But before I do,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.990
I like to dock the tools to the right
side of the browser window.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.420
Since most phones
are viewed in portrait,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.820
docking to the right side gives me
the most amount of vertical space.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.110
The other thing I need to do is pick
the device that I want to emulate.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.240
Chrome has a bunch of predefined
devices, that I can choose from.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.510
It auto-magically sets the view
port size, the user agent string,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.795
device pixel ratio, and
enables touch emulation.

00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:57.735
If you're not familiar with some
of these terms, don't worry.

00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:00.095
We'll cover them as part of this course.

00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:03.825
Now I can see how a page renders
across different devices without ever

00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:04.385
leaving Chrome.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.870
Sweet, that looks about
how I'd expect it.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.420
Chrome has several other
things that it can emulate for

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.320
you in the Emulation panel.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.950
Hit Escape to bring it up.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.490
Why don't you go check out a few sites
with different emulated devices and

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.120
see how they behave?

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.110
And, don't forget to check out some of
the other things that you can emulate

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.650
while you're there.
