00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.450
Let's do another quiz, where the two coins are

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.340
dependent on each other. So let's assume a case

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.453
where you flip two coins, A and B and

00:00:08.453 --> 00:00:13.370
there's some gravitational force or some kind of weird force

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.380
acting between them. So, whatever the A flips as,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.720
if the A flips as heads, B also turns

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.410
out to be head. And if A flips as

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.550
tails, B also comes out to be tails. So complete

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.020
information is transferred from A and B, and so they're

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.006
completely dependent on each other. So, find out similarly, what

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:36.758
is the joint probability between A, B, conditional probability, their entropies

00:00:36.758 --> 00:00:42.024
and the conditional entropies and their mutual information. Go.
