00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.847
I always need to use a table when I'm solving rational inequalities and

00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:08.037
quadratic ones for that matter, so here is my filled out table. Now I can just

00:00:08.037 --> 00:00:12.132
read off which of these regions contains x values that make this fraction or

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:16.609
this rational expression negative. So that's just this first reqion, which is x

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.180
is less than two, and the second region x is greater than 3. [inaudible] Since

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.779
on a number line these two regions do not overlap, we have to use an or since no

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.516
value of x can fall inside both regions. So the solution is, x is less than 2 or

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:35.157
x is greater than 3. Let's take a second to think about how we could visualize

00:00:35.157 --> 00:00:39.801
this inequality using graphs. So here I've plotted 2 Equations. I plotted Y

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:44.715
equals negative 16 X plus 48, over the quantity 3 minus 6, and the purple line

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:49.172
is just the line Y equals 0. The X axis. We want to know according to our

00:00:49.172 --> 00:00:54.336
inequality when this line, the pink one, lies underneath the purple one. We want

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:58.890
to know when the Y values of this curve drop below this curve. So we can see

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.774
that, that's every part that's going to happen for all X values except for those

00:01:03.774 --> 00:01:08.141
in the very small portion of the curve that's up here. We can see that this

00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:12.604
matches the solution we came up with. This curve lies below this one, anywhere

00:01:12.604 --> 00:01:16.689
beyond this point, where x is equal to 3. And anywhere in this part of the

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.348
graph. This line right here that represents the disconnect between these 2

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:26.394
portions of the pink graph. Goes straight through the .20. And, in fact, this is

00:01:26.394 --> 00:01:31.184
the line, x equals 2. We can see that the entire part of the pink graph that's

00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:35.972
to the left of this, or that has x values less than 2, is underneath the purple

00:01:35.972 --> 00:01:38.738
curve. So this fits what we found. Awesome.
