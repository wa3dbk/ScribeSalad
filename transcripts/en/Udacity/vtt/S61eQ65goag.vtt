00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.320
To write out 3.1 times 10 to the negative 7th, we need to divide 3.1 by 10,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.928
seven times. So that means we need to move the decimal point seven times to the

00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:16.474
left. Let's do it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So this is where my

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:22.678
decimal point belongs now. Let's fill in our zeros. We have one to the left of

00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:29.560
the decimal point, and then we have six more zeros before we get to the 3. So

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.199
our answer is 0.00000031. That's a pretty tiny number.
