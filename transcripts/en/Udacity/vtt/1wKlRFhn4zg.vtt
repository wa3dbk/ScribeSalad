00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.570
So we've reached the end of unit four. I hope you

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.710
feel like you understand at a high level what's going on in

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.150
a web browser, what's going on when you request a page

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.680
over the internet. There's certainly lots of details, we're not going to cover

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.130
them all in this class. But I think you should have

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.010
a pretty clear picture of everything that's going on. There's nothing that's

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.805
magic here, everything can be understood.

00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:22.200
Everything's done by sending messages across

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.220
the internet and getting responses back and the responses are just text

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.160
that are processed either by your web browser or now by

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.810
your very own web crawler that you've written, and now you've got

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.060
a search engine that can respond to queries. So, congratulations for

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.420
making it to the end of Unit Four. There'll be a homework

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.880
to do now, and in Unit Five we're going to look at

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.285
the problem of how to actually make our search engine scale. The

00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:48.150
search engine that we've built in unit four works, it gives us

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.270
responses to queries, it doesn't do that in a very fast or

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.220
smart way. That's what we're going to improve in unit five. We're

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.920
going to make it so that we can respond to queries much faster

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.750
than we can with the code that we've written so far.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.870
And then in unit six we're going to look at the very interesting

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.720
question of how do you find the best response for a

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.660
given query. We don't usually want to get all the pages that contain

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.130
the search word we're looking for. What we want to do is get

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.120
the best page. And that's what we'll look at in unit six.
