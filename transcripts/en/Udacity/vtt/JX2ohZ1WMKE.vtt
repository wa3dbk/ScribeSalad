00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Norvig] Here's one way to do it.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What I've done is I only changed this line, and instead of just returning r

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
for r, s in hand, I've taken r and used it as a lookup into this value.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So I'm saying when r is the letter 2, I look up into this string and say

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
what index is 2 in there and where is it?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You start counting at 0, so it's 0, 1, 2.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So the character 2 would map to the number 2,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the character T would map to the number 10, J to 11,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Q to 12, K to 13, and A to 14.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So that gives me a correct mapping from characters to index numbers,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and they'll all come out right. I could have done it other ways.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I could have had a dictionary lookup, I could have had a long set of if-then-else statements,

00:00:54.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but this seemed the simplest way to do it.
