00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.270
One of the most important concepts in programming, is the notion of a Data Type.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.370
Which we also just call a type. You've been using types since your first

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.594
programming, so you already know a fair bit about types. We just haven't talked

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:14.150
about it explicitly until now. Understanding types more deeply, will make you a

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.300
better programmer, will help you understand more what's going on when your

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.390
programs run. It will also get you to the point where you can define your own

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.679
data types. And that will be useful for making our search engine kept more

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.795
modular, like we just talked about. So first thing I'm going to introduce some

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:32.340
terminology. Everything that you can reference in a Python program is an object.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.147
What is the mean to be over the reference something. Well that means we can give

00:00:35.147 --> 00:00:38.625
it a name. There are lots of ways to give things names. You could pass it as a

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:43.635
parameter, you could use it in an assignment. Anything that could be assigned to

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:48.854
a name is an object in Python. Every object has a type. We can think of types as

00:00:48.854 --> 00:00:53.012
sets of values, and the type of an object tells us something about what we can

00:00:53.012 --> 00:00:56.913
do with it. There is an easy way to explore types in Python, and that's to use

00:00:56.913 --> 00:01:01.711
the built-in type operator. The type operator takes any object as its input, and

00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:06.810
produces as it's output the type of the input object. Here's an example, so here

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.674
we're using type to find the type of the object which is the number 101. That's

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:14.918
an object. We can reference it. We can assign it to a variable. We could pass as

00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:19.232
a parameter. So it must have a type and it has type int, which is short for

00:01:19.232 --> 00:01:23.802
integer. What you might find a little more surprising. Is we can do the same

00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:28.291
thing with functions, so we've defined the function double that takes one input

00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:33.240
and returns x plus x. See if you can guess what the type of double is before I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.363
evaluate this. It has type, and its type is function.
