00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.550
Intuitively, it should be clear
that the capacity of a cut

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.110
represents an upper bound on the amount
of flow that could go from s to t.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.400
We state this as the following lemma.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.940
Let f be a flow and let (A,
B) and s-t cut in a flow network.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.530
Well then the value of the flow is
at most the capacity of the cut.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.550
The proof goes like this.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.780
The value of the flow is the flow
out of A minus the flow into A.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.370
We can just drop the second term,
leaving us with just the sum

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.430
of the flows across
individual edges from A to B.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.780
This is bounded by
the capacity of these edges.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.070
And this sum then is
the capacity of the cut.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.630
Note that from this proof,
the inequality will be tight if no

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.330
flow goes back from B to A and
if all the crossing edges are saturated.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.490
That is, used to their full capacity.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.220
Keep this in mind.
