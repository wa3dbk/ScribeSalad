00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.108
So you've seen that complex numbers are just another kind of number, a type of

00:00:04.108 --> 00:00:08.332
number that subsumes both the real numbers and the imaginary numbers, and also

00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:12.622
contains some numbers that are part of each. Part imaginary and part real, so

00:00:12.622 --> 00:00:16.648
presumably we can manipulate complex numbers then in the same way that we

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:21.016
manipulate real, Real numbers. Let's try this out and see if it works. What if

00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:25.426
I'd like you to add 2 complex numbers tegether, let's say 3 plus 4I and 5 minus

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:29.817
2I. What do you think you'll get? This is obviously not something that we've

00:00:29.817 --> 00:00:34.136
done before together so, just try it out. Think back though, to adding like

00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:37.669
terms and how we practiced that pretty early on in the course.
