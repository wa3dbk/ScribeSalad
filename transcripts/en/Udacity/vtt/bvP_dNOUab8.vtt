00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.710
So let's see Java RMI at work. On

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.590
the server side, it's a three-step process to make

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.140
the server object visible on the network. You

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.910
instantiate the object. Once you instantiate the object, you

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.630
create a URL, whatever you want to call the URL. And then you go to the Java run

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.330
time, and the facility that's available in the Java

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.910
run time For binding the URL that you created

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.470
with the instance of the object that

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.920
you created. The object that you instantiated;

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.070
it binds it to this URL and it is now in the naming service

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.080
of the Java runtime system. For clients to be able to discover the existence

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.610
of this new service that you created and made it available on the network.
