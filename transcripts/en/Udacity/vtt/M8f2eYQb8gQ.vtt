00:00:00.035 --> 00:00:02.025
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So now, let's analyze this algorithm.

00:00:02.025 --> 00:00:06.094
We know the complexity of the first phase, this reduced phase, already.

00:00:06.094 --> 00:00:14.619
We know that it has log n steps, as a function of the input count n, and order of n operations.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.106
So actually, if we have n elements, we're going to have n minus 1 additions.

00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:25.974
And the analysis for the downsweep phase is exactly the same as the analysis for the reduce phase

00:00:25.974 --> 00:00:29.268
because the communication pattern here is exactly the same,

00:00:29.268 --> 00:00:32.212
except mirror imaged as the communication pattern here.

00:00:32.212 --> 00:00:36.976
So we know the downsweep also has log n steps and a linear amount of work.

00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:41.989
This is great. We've now reached the same work efficiency as the serial implementation.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.192
Note, however, that it has more steps than the Hillis and Steele formulation.

00:00:46.192 --> 00:00:52.619
Recall that the Hillis and Steele formulation had log n steps and the Blelloch formulation,

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:56.865
this reduced downsweep method, has two log n steps.

00:00:56.865 --> 00:01:01.162
But the advantage of this Blelloch implementation is less work over all.

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:05.672
Recall again that the Hillis and Steele scan had o of n log n work,

00:01:05.672 --> 00:01:10.243
whereas the Blelloch scan has linear amount of work with respect to the input.

00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:13.346
Now which is faster? That's a good question.

00:01:13.346 --> 00:01:16.657
To some extent, it's dependent on the particular GPU, the problem size,

00:01:16.657 --> 00:01:19.703
the particular optimizations that you chose during the implementation.

00:01:19.703 --> 00:01:22.391
But to give you a little bit of intuition as to how you might

00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:26.405
think about the problem of choosing between two different formulations of the same algorithm,

00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:29.326
one of which has superior work efficiency

00:01:29.326 --> 00:01:35.074
like Blelloch scan, one of which has superior step efficiency like Hillis and Steele scan.
