00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here's the idea: you collect the votes from the voters. Those are inputs to a random permutation.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's say this is controlled by the Apple Party,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and what the permutation does is randomly scramble the order of the votes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now the position of the votes that came in

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
doesn't match the position of the votes that came out.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We'll also do some encryption, and we'll get to that in the next question part.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Those are passed along to the next party. Let's call that the Blue Party.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The Blue Party also scrambles the votes in some random permutation,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and then those are passed along to the next one and we'll call this one the Crazy Party.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Our parties start with the letters A, B, and C, and the Crazy Party does the same thing.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It selects some other random permutation where it randomly selects a permutation,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and it scrambles the positions of the votes.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In order for this to work, we want at the end of this to know what the actual votes are.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The question is what value should we use for x to enable this chain.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Our security assumption is that the Apple, the Blue, and the Crazy Party all hate each other.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
They wouldn't possibly collude, so they can be trusted not to collude with the other parties.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But otherwise they can't be trusted, they'll want to try to change the election,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
change the votes, and do everything they can.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The question is which one of these would be the best choice for the xi values?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Neither of these are the correct choice.  Neither of these will work securely.

00:01:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We're going to have to do some other things, but which one of these is the best starting choice?
