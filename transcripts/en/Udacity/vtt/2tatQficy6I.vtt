00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.922
So let's do a computer architecture quiz. So,

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:06.846
computer architecture is about how to build faster

00:00:06.846 --> 00:00:09.294
transistors out of which we will then build

00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:12.558
computers, how to build faster computers, how to build

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:16.570
larger buildings, how to design energy-efficient computers, how

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.814
to build buildings where we can fit more

00:00:18.814 --> 00:00:21.534
computers, and how to build computers that fit

00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:25.480
better into buildings. Select all answers that are true.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.590
More than one can be correct.
