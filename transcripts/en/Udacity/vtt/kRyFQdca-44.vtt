00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.930
Let's look at the answer to our quiz.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.710
What kind of application gets no
benefit from miss-under-miss support?

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.210
One that always sits in
the cache gets no benefit.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.480
It never has misses so it cannot
benefit from miss-under-miss support.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.740
An application that misses every 1000
instructions will have a miss, and

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.400
the processor will run
out of ROB entries

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.580
because it has fewer than 1000
until it finds the next miss.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.030
So that application will
suffer the first miss, and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.920
only then the processor can continue and
find the next miss, so

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.530
we never actually need
to do miss-under-miss.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.070
So, this application will not benefit.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.490
An application that has a miss every
ten instructions will have a miss and

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.460
will find the next miss, so it can
benefit from a miss-under-miss support.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.170
So, this should not be checked.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.050
And then, an application that has a miss
every two instructions, of course, will

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.210
also benefit from a miss-under-miss,
so we don't check this either.
