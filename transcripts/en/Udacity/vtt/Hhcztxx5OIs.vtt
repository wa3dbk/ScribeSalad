00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You now know the basics of dealing with NP-complete problems

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.500
or NP-hard problems if we're talking about an optimization problem.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.000
Designing intelligent algorithms to find an exact solution, or, failing that,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
accepting approximate solutions,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or even incorporating randomness into the algorithms.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Are those all of the possible ways that you can deal with an NP-complete problem?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Of course not; there are, for example, combinations between approximation

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
algorithms and randomization algorithms.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And, of course, there are also algorithms that you can use

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.500
if you don't demand performance guarantees because the algorithms

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.000
that we have analyzed, have always provided a certain guarantee

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
as to how they would perform.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If you don't require such performance guarantees,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.500
there's an arsenal of other techniques out there, known as heuristics.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
Some concrete examples for that would be evolutionary algorithms, genetic

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
algorithms, simulated annealing, local search, meta-heuristics, and many more.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.500
Be warned, though; just because some other algorithms don't have any

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.000
provable performance guarantees doesn't necessarily mean

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that they are simpler or easy.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Rather, successful implementations of any technique for an NP-complete problem

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
require a lot of thought.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And I think the general rule here is finding good solutions to hard problems

00:01:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
requires a lot of thought no matter what technique you're using.
