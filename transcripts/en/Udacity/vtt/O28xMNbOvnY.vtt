00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:08.119
mood and anxiety disorders. However, drugs are also used to treat some of the

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.127
neurodevelopmental disorders that we talked about in the last lesson. For

00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:17.718
example, stimulant drugs are use to treat children with ADHD. Now recall that

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:20.708
stimulant drugs help combat some of the difficulty that children experience

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:24.579
with concentrating. That is, the stimulants improve their ability to

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:25.670
concentrate.
