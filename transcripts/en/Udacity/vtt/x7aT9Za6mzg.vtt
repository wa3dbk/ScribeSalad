00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.430
Now that we have a file path where we
can save our GIF's we just need to add

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.730
two method calls.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.450
The method that saves the GIF's,
archiveRootObject,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.950
and the method that retrieves them,
unarchiveObjectWithFile.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.230
If you look in the app delegate
of the Objective C project

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.700
you'll see that these two
methods are called here.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.140
But we want to keep our
swift app delicate nice and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.200
clean, so we're going to call these
methods, in the save to GIF's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.730
view controller instead, so
switching back to our swift project.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.390
So here we are in our save to
GIF's view controller, and

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.970
I'm going to suggest that we
call archive root object,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.750
as soon as a GIF is saved, here in
the method previewVC, didSaveGif.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.415
Now where should we put the method
call that retrieves our GIF's.
