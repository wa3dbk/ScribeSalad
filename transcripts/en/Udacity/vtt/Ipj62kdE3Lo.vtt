00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.198
So now, this time using these exact values, let's calculate the confidence

00:00:05.198 --> 00:00:10.062
interval for the mean if the entire population of Klout users used the Bieber

00:00:10.062 --> 00:00:15.670
Tweeter. And just to refresh your memory, we took a sample of Bieber Tweeter

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.672
users of size 35 and found that their mean Klout score was 40. If we assume that

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:28.470
this mean score is one of the 95% that lies within 1.96 standard deviations from

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.959
the mean, then what's the range of possible values that the population mean

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:40.176
could be? And remember, this is the would be population mean if everyone used

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:45.276
the Bieber Tweeter. So, what's going to be your lower bound and what's going to

00:00:45.276 --> 00:00:48.109
be your upper bound? Give it your best shot.
