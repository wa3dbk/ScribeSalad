00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.400
So the answer is 13. And the reason for this is quite

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.140
interesting. If you look at the answers we were getting so far, this

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.790
is the number of calls for each number. So when we had fibo

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.940
36, the number of calls was 1. When the input was 35,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:26.010
the number of calls was also 1. When the input was 34, the number of calls was 2.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.400
When the input was 33, the number of calls

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.189
was 3. When the input was 32, the number

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.220
of calls was 5. We should start to

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.190
notice a pattern. This is exactly the Fibonacci series

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.420
that we're computing here. Every time we decrease n

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.770
by 1, so to get the number of calls

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.670
for 32, we added the number of calls for 1 before and the number of calls for

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.950
2 before, and if you look at the structure

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.950
of this, it follows from the same rule that

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.320
we had, thinking about the number of rabbits reproducing.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.600
That everyone that we have on the previous level,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.140
leads to two more. And that means as we

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.720
do this addition, we have all the previous calls.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.430
So we had 1 call the 34 at the

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.180
previous level. We're going to produce two new calls but

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.850
the inputs are different. But if we look at

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.140
the way the inputs are distributed, we have 2 plus

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:28.180
1 here. We have 1 plus 1 for 34. We have 2 plus 1 for 33. For 32 we

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.020
have 2 plus 3. We have 5. For 31,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.250
we're going to have eight calls, and for 30, we're going to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.050
have 5 plus 8, which is 13. And

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.240
this will keep going. These numbers will get quite

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.135
big very fast. And the number of calls we

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:47.580
need, every time we evaluate fibo 36, so the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.350
evaluate the number of calls, when we started

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.540
with 36 that's going to be the result of fibo

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.030
36 minus n minus 1. So the number of

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.430
calls we'll need to fibo 2 in evaluating fibo

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.090
36 will be fibo 33 calls, and we don't

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.590
know what that number is yet. Because when we tried

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.850
to evaluate fibonacci 36, using our recursive definition, our

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.210
evaluator timed out, so we're in big trouble. If we

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.610
want to figure out how many calls there are,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.630
we need a more efficient way of computing Fibonacci numbers.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.320
So let's see if we can do that. And

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.540
the reason this was so inefficient was because we're doing

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.202
all this redundant work, right? We saw that to

00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:32.712
compute fibonacci 36, well we had to compute fibonacci 35,

00:02:32.712 --> 00:02:35.746
and we had to compute fibonacci 34, all of

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:39.560
this work computing fibonacci 34. We did the same exact

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.040
thing over here, right? This is producing the same

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.790
output. There's tons and tons of redundant computation going on.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.200
So if we're going to compute this more efficiently, we

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.700
don't want to duplicate all that work. We need to do

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.760
it in a way, where we don't need

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.780
to keep recomputing the same thing. So the solution

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.980
to this, is instead of using a recursive procedure

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.390
to compute fibonacci. We're going to compute fibonacci using

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.900
a while loop. Anything that we can define recursively,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.550
we can also define without using a recursive definition.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.690
It's often much easier and cleaner to think about

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.840
things, with a recursive definition, but it's often not

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.450
the fastest way to calculate things. And certainly, in this

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.210
case, because of all the redundant computation, it's a very, very

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.100
inefficient way to calculate fibonacci. So let's try to do this

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.020
with a while loop instead and we'll make that a quiz.
