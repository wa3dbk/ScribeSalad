00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.358
Remember that to get that common denominator in both terms, we need to multiply

00:00:05.358 --> 00:00:10.589
the first term by 5 over 5, so the denominator becomes 5x. Then we just combine

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.835
our like terms, and simplify. This gives us a new equation of 14 over 5x equals

00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:16.024
7.
