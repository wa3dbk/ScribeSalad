00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.130
This is the first time we have come across the topic of learning in this course,

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.350
so let us examine it a little bit more closely.

00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:10.730
We are all interested in asking the question, how do agents learn?

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.800
But this question is not isolated from a series of other questions.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.910
What do agents learn? What is the source of their learning? When do they learn?

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.220
And why do they learn at all? For the purpose of addressing what goal or

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.060
what task? Now here is the fundamental stance that knowledge

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.540
based AI takes. It says that we'll start with a theory of reasoning.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.670
That will help us address questions like, what to learn,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.000
when to learn, why to do learning? And only then will we go to the question,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.710
of how to do the learning. So, we reasoning first, and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.180
then backwards to learning. This happened in production systems.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.340
When the production system reach an impasse, then it said let's learn

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.550
in order to resolve this impasse from episodic knowledge. So once again,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.760
we are trying to build a unified theory of reasoning, memory, and learning

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.340
where the demands of memory and reasoning constrain the processing of learning.
