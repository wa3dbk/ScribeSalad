00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.430
We need an expression here in order to subset our

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.630
data frame. So really I'll just run the subset command

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.920
on our pf data frame or pseudo-Facebook users and I'll

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.810
take ages that are less than 70. Now the question

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.850
said 70 or less so I should really use less

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.650
than or equals here. Running this code we get a

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.790
very different summary statistic. In fact, this tells a different

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.660
story about a negative relationship between age and friend count.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.530
As age increases, we can see that friend count

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.950
decreases. It's important to note that one variable doesn't

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.720
cause the other. For example, it'd be unwise to

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.850
say that growing old means that you have fewer

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.480
internet friends. We'd really need to have data from

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.470
experimental research and make use of inferential statistics. Rather

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.340
than descriptive statistics to address causality. You may have

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.940
noticed that I left off the method parameter from cor.test.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.965
And that's because cor.test defaults to using the Pearson

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:57.390
Product-Moment Correlation. No matter what we do. Adding this

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.350
in as a parameter, we should get the same

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.500
result. And running this code, sure enough, I do.
