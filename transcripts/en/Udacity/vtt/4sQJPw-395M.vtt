00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.887
So now we have, from the last quiz, the equation, negative x squared over 8 plus

00:00:04.887 --> 00:00:09.947
4 x minus 14 equals 0. We already saw though that these two equations, which we

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:15.074
know both describe our parabola here, are equivalent to one another. So that

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:19.617
means, we know that negative x squared over 8 plus 4 x minus 14 is equal to

00:00:19.617 --> 00:00:24.191
negative 1 8th times x minus 4 times x minus 28. So, we can set the right-hand

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:28.806
side of this equation equal to zero through simple substitution. Wonderful, now

00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:33.432
we have another equation. This one, however, is actually pretty easy to solve if

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:37.905
we think of a little trick. First things first, we're going to simplify. Can you

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:42.372
think of a really, really easy way to simplify this? In particular, I'd really

00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:46.423
love to get rid of this factor of negative 1 8th. The first thing I'd like you

00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:50.263
to tell me is what we can do to both sides of this equation to get rid of this

00:00:50.263 --> 00:00:54.260
factor of negative 1 8th. In this little blue box, please write some sort of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.350
operator and then a number. Plus, minus, multiply or divide, and then whatever

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.586
number you think we should do that with. Once you figure out how to get rid of

00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:06.678
this negative 1 8th, I'd like you to write the new version of the equation in

00:01:06.678 --> 00:01:10.921
this box right here. So, the equation I want here is just the equation that we

00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:13.834
have after we get rid of that factor of negative 1 8th.
