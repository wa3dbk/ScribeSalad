00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.530
This class is divided into
three subclasses, three parts.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.010
They are supervised learning.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Unsupervised learning,

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.470
and reinforcement.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.145
So, what do you think
supervised learning is?

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:17.510
&gt;&gt; So, I think of supervised learning
as being the problem of taking labelled

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.057
data sets, gleaning information from
it so that you can label new data sets.

00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:24.138
&gt;&gt; That's fair.

00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:26.355
I call that function approximation.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.798
So, here's an example
of supervised learning.

00:00:28.798 --> 00:00:31.342
I'm going to give you an input and
an output.

00:00:31.342 --> 00:00:32.912
And I'm going to give
them to you as pairs, and

00:00:32.912 --> 00:00:34.360
I want you to guess
what the function is.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.441
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Okay?

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:36.185
Okay.

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:36.845
1, 1.

00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:37.925
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:38.784
2, 4.

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:40.920
&gt;&gt; Wait, hang on,
is 1 the input and 1 the output,.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.840
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And 2 the input, and 4 the output?

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.057
&gt;&gt; Correct.
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:45.820
I'm on, I think I am on to you.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.440
&gt;&gt; 3, 9.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.628
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; 4, 16.

00:00:47.628 --> 00:00:48.383
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:00:48.383 --> 00:00:49.148
&gt;&gt; 5, 25.

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:50.426
6, 36.

00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:51.446
7, 49.

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:52.666
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:53.503
This is a very hip data set.

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:54.349
&gt;&gt; It is.

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:56.010
What's the function?
&gt;&gt; It's hip to be squared.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.200
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.490
Maybe.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.660
So if you believe that's true,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.150
then tell me if the input is 10,
what's the output?

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.519
&gt;&gt; 100.
&gt;&gt; And that's right, if it turns out,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.880
in fact, that the function is x squared.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.920
But the truth is, we have no idea
whether this function is x squared.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.800
Not really.
&gt;&gt; I have a pretty good idea.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.360
&gt;&gt; You do?
&gt;&gt; Well-

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.760
&gt;&gt; Where's that idea come from?

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.070
&gt;&gt; It comes from having spoken with
you over a long period of time.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.990
And plus, you know, math.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.970
&gt;&gt; And plus math.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.430
Well, I'm going to-

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.100
&gt;&gt; You can't say I'm wrong.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.230
&gt;&gt; You're wrong.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.060
&gt;&gt; Oh.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.910
&gt;&gt; You just said I was wrong.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.330
&gt;&gt; No, you've talked to me for
a long time, and plus math.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.280
I agree with that.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.280
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; But

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.510
I'm going to claim that you're
making a leap of faith.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.110
&gt;&gt; Hm.
&gt;&gt; Despite being a scientist,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.019
by deciding that the input is 10 and
the output is 100.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.250
&gt;&gt; Sure.
I would agree with that.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.562
&gt;&gt; What's that leap of faith?

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:44.903
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, from what you told me,
it's still consistent with lots of

00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:48.840
other mappings from input to
output like 10 gets mapped to 11.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.046
&gt;&gt; Right or
everything is x squared except 10.

00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:51.603
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:51.603 --> 00:01:53.344
&gt;&gt; Or everything is x,
x squared up to 10.

00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:54.365
&gt;&gt; Right, that would be mean-

00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:55.446
&gt;&gt; That would be mean-

00:01:55.446 --> 00:01:57.802
&gt;&gt; But it's not logically impossible.

00:01:57.802 --> 00:01:59.161
&gt;&gt; What would be the median?

00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:00.100
&gt;&gt; A-ha.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.727
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:01.955
I, I was saving that one up.
