00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Of course, exponential growth is highly unrealistic. Let's have a look at this diagram.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now the horizontal axis is not the time, it's the amount of fish,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and the vertical axis is the growth rate.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
With exponential growth, the growth rate does not depend on the amount of fish.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Even if the ocean were full of fish, we would still have

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the same growth rate, which cannot be true.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There should be some sort of carrying capacity at which the growth rate becomes zero.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The easiest way to include this effect is to use the growth rate.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that depends on the amount of fish in the linear fashion.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is called logistic growth.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If the amount of fish is very small, we start with the high growth rate

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and as the amount of fish increases, the growth rate drops

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and if the amount of fish reaches the carrying capacity of the environment,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
there won't be any growth anymore.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
How do we turn this effect plus constant harvesting into an equation.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Here are three options for you to choose from.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Should the rate of change of the amount of fish be of 0.5/1 year times

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the amount minus 10⁶ tons minus 10⁵ tons per year or should it be

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
0.5 per year times 1 minus the amount over 10⁶ tons times the amount minus 10⁵ tons per year

00:01:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or should it be 0.5 per year times the amount minus 10⁶ tons times the amount minus 10⁵ tons per year.
