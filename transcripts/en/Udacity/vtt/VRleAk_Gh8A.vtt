00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.260
As you can see it's pretty straight forward. We check to see if the gain value

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.707
is greater than 0, which means it's not muted. So in that case we want to set

00:00:10.707 --> 00:00:15.854
it to 0 to mute the sound. If it isn't greater than 0 that means it is muted

00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:19.523
and we'll want to toggle it back to 1.
