00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:02.589
No, it definitely will not always succeed.

00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:05.978
There are some nice probabilistic guarantees about how often it will succeed

00:00:05.978 --> 00:00:08.444
depending on the size and number of the hash tables,

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:12.414
but the easy counterexample is to say that, well, here we have 2 hash tables.

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:16.720
If we had 3 items, each of which had the same H1 and H2--

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.557
so for instance if we had 3 items where H1 and H2 were both 0,

00:00:20.557 --> 00:00:23.360
there's no possible way that we can fit them into the hash table,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.097
because we only have 2 slots where any hash function is equal to 0.

00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:31.534
So in practice we choose a certain number of iterations, and we continue to iterate,

00:00:31.534 --> 00:00:35.910
trying to fill up this hash table until we decide that we've done too many iterations.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.813
And so if that's the case then we just stop, we choose new hash functions, and we start over.

00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:44.347
And again, there's very nice probabilistic guarantees about how often this is going to finish.

00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:47.003
So in the research that inspired this work,

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.186
the guarantee that we tried to use

00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:55.022
was that we could guarantee that it was going to fail less than 1 out of every million times.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:58.505
So once we construct the hash table, the lookup procedure is really simple.

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:02.012
We're going to calculate all the hash functions for the item that we want to look up.

00:01:02.012 --> 00:01:07.242
So for instance, if I want to look up item B, I calculate item B's hash functions.

00:01:07.242 --> 00:01:10.954
Here hash function 1 is equal to 0, and hash function 2 is equal to 1.

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:13.306
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to look in all tables

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.416
using the particular hash functions until I find what I'm looking for.

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:20.982
So first, I'm going to look in table 1, and I know that I'm going to look in slot 0.

00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:24.029
Here I look in slot 0, and I say, "Wait a second, that's not B."

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:28.915
So then I have to go to table 2, look and see that its hash value is equal to 1,

00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:33.023
so I'll look in slot 1 in table 2, and I'll say, "Ah, there's B!"

00:01:33.023 --> 00:01:35.313
I've now found the value that I'm looking for.

00:01:35.313 --> 00:01:38.329
Now if we don't find it in any of these locations, it's just not in the has table.

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.539
Now the nice part here is that this is a constant time lookup.

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.074
It just requires T lookups, and T is a constant.

00:01:44.074 --> 00:01:46.383
It might be 2, it might be 3, and so on.

00:01:46.383 --> 00:01:48.111
This is different than chaining.

00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:49.947
Chaining has a variable time lookup.

00:01:49.947 --> 00:01:52.315
It depends on how many items are in the bucket,

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:55.118
and if we have many items in the bucket, and we have to look all the way to the end,

00:01:55.118 --> 00:01:57.165
it can potentially take a very long time,

00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:59.456
whereas we can guarantee exactly how much work,

00:01:59.456 --> 00:02:03.000
and it's a constant amount of work to look up any item in these hash tables.
