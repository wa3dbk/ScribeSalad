00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For this procedure, we're going to write a converter

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which takes a dictionary and a date as its inputs.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The dictionary converts the number of the month to the name of the month,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and the date is in the format month/day/year,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which I've written up here so we don't forget the order.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The output should be in the form day, name of the month, year.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
How are we going to split up month, day, and year?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The way we're going to do that is to look for the forward slashes in the string.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The first forward slash we can find at the position between the month and the day.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Everything up to the first forward slash is the month.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The month is equal to everything up to the first slash, and that's exclusive.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's doesn't include the slash itself.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The second slash we can find by looking from the first slash onwards.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We look at the position one after the first slash to find the second slash.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We know it's somewhere there.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We can't say it's exactly two steps after or one step,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
because the day could be one digit or two digits.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The day is between the first slash and the second slash.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Note, that we have to add 1 onto first because we want to go 1 position after the slash

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and it's inclusive for the first place here, and exclusive for the second.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Then year is the date from 1 position after the second forward slash.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So now we've got the day, the month, and the year.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We need to turn it into the format to return it.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We're going return the string which is day and the space, then the month, and then the year.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now month we need to look up in our dictionary.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We're going to look it up in the dictionary, but we can't just put month in straight away,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
because month is a string and the dictionary uses a number as it's index.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
We have to turn the string into an integer.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Then we need a space again, and finally, the year on the end.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That's the first method.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The second method is much shorter.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It uses a procedure you've seen before but something that you may not know about that procedure.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I'll show it to you just for completeness' sake.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
We can get the month, the day, and the year by splitting the date

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and using an input for that split.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now, split without an input just splits on white space.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Split with input splits on whatever that input is.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Date.split will split into month, day, and year.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We can use a triple assignment to get those out straight away.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Then we just need to return exactly the same as we returned before.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That's a very simple way of writing it, which does exactly the same as the first one.
