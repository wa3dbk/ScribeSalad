00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.060
So the first technique for reducing the
miss rate is using larger cache blocks.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.280
They help the miss
rate because more words

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.520
are brought in when we have a miss so
subsequent axises

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.219
that might access those additional words
that we brought will not be misses.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.980
And they would be misses if we
had the smaller cache block.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.750
So this does reduce the miss rate, but
only when spatial locality is good.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.040
But when spatial locality is poor,
the miss rate will increase,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.140
because now what happens is we bring
in the word we need, and along with it,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.110
now, we bring more words that we
didn't need, so effectively our cache

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.120
now looks like a lower capacity cache
because it has more junk in it.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.610
So, we end up suffering more
of those capacity misses.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.099
So, if we plot the miss rate and how
it changes as the block size changes.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.390
For a small cache we might
get something like this.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.100
Where the miss rate drops as we
increase the block size, but

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.570
then starts increasing as we exhaust
the amount of spatial locality

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.110
that the cache can support.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.140
But then it starts to grow
as we start to suffer

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.650
from the miss rate increase because
there is not enough special locality.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.014
For a 4KB cash, this might happen for
example with the block size of 64.

00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:35.524
Interestingly however,
for larger caches,

00:01:35.524 --> 00:01:39.844
we will start out with the lower
miss rate to begin with and

00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:44.520
it will continue to drop
up to larger block sizes.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.340
Eventually, it's going to
start to increase.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.440
But here we might be looking at for
example, 256 byte block size.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.380
This effect has to do with,
how much junk

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.750
are we putting in the cache, and
how much room there is in the cache.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.940
So some blocks will have
more locality than others.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.510
And then in a small cache,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.560
those that don't have enough spatial
locality are creating some junk.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.090
And those that do have a lot of spatial
locality are being placed in the cache,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.240
but there is not enough room for
them because of all the junk.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.900
When we have a larger cache,
for example 256 KB,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.430
then what happens is
those blocks that don't

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.800
have enough locality put some junk in
the cache, but the cache is bigger.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.960
So it can also contain those blocks
that do have spatial locality, so

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.670
the cache tolerates
a slightly bigger block size.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.000
Overall, we can reduce the miss rate,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.800
especially in a larger cache
if we increase the block size.
