00:00:00.018 --> 00:00:02.447
The identity element for unsigned int is the element

00:00:02.447 --> 00:00:05.396
that will give us back the same output for any given input,

00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:08.557
and for us that's going to be the smallest representable value,

00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:11.381
and that's going to be a big, fat 0.

00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:15.791
Any element max 0 is going to give us back that element.

00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:18.764
Now we're going to start computing the output here.

00:00:18.764 --> 00:00:21.659
So remember, we always start with the identity element here

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:26.814
and then for each output element we take the max of all the elements that precede it.

00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:30.322
So here, that's the max of 3, so that's simply 3,

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:33.782
next the max of 3 and 1, that's going to give us 3,

00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:36.647
next max of 3, 1, and 4,

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:39.548
max of 3, 1, 4, 1,

00:00:39.548 --> 00:00:42.139
max of 3, 1, 4, 1, 5,

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:45.922
so our output array here is 0, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5.

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:51.396
This is the max scan on unsigned ints of this 6-element input vector.

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:55.894
You might note that the input element 9 is not used in this calculation, and that's correct.

00:00:55.894 --> 00:00:58.897
That's simply the nature of this formulation of scan.
