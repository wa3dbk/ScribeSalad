00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.470
Here's my answer.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.550
We'll go diagonal by diagonal.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.210
The first one is easy since it's just
the cost of the pairwise product.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.660
Next we'll consider this entry here
corresponding to the product of ABC.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.044
First, consider breaking it up as A(BC).

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.305
That would be 0 for computing A,
+ 9 for computing C,

00:00:23.305 --> 00:00:30.300
+ 6 x 3 x 3 for computing the product,
for a total of 63.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.440
The other partition, (A B) x C,
has cost 18 for (A B).

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.424
0 for C and 6 x1 x 3 for

00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:46.260
combining the products,
for a total of 36.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.280
That ends up as the smaller of the two
possibilities, so we'll go ahead and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.980
write that information
in the table here.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.990
Now we move on to the other entry
along this diagonal, the one for

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.910
the product BCD.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.150
We'll consider first
computing this as B(CD).

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.270
That costs 0 for B, 24 for CD, and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.700
for computing the product,
3 x 1 x 8, for a total of 48.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.660
The other partition,
BC x D, has cost 9 for

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.203
BC, 0 for just grabbing D and

00:01:23.203 --> 00:01:29.470
3 x 3 x 8 for the product,
for a total 82.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.150
48 is the minimum cost and the better
partition is B x the quantity CD.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.300
So, we'll record that
information in the table.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.160
Now, for the last entry.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.460
Consider first the partition
A x the quantity BCD.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.470
The cost of A by itself is 0.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.630
The cost of BCD, was 48 and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.950
the cost of the product was 6
x 3 x 8 for a total of 192.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.360
The products AB x CD costs 18 for

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.230
AB, 24 for CD, and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.150
6 x 1 x 8 for combining these
products for a total of 90.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.960
Lastly, we have this partition
the quantity ABC x D.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.290
ABC cost 36, D by itself costs 0,

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.380
and the product costs 6 x 3 x 8 for
a total of 180.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.180
The middle one here is clearly the best,
so we record that fact, and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.310
that gives us the partition, which we
can write in these squares like so.
