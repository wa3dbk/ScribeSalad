00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.605
Let's go over each of these individually. And let's say that n is 4. So, we

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:13.958
have four values here in order, from least to greatest. So if n is 4, the rank

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:20.585
of this value is 1, and the rank of this value is 4. And the actual values are

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:27.719
these. So, for this one, n divided by 2 would be 4 divided by 2, which is 2. X

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:32.876
sub 2 is this one. Is this the median? No, because since it's an even data set,

00:00:32.876 --> 00:00:38.795
the median is going to be the average of these 2. But now, we know that this

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:46.900
data value is Xn divided by 2. The rank n minus 1 divided by 2 would be 4 minus

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.732
1, which is 3. And then divided by 2, which is 1.5. And that doesn't exist. We

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:58.949
don't have any with a rank of a decimal value, only integer value. What about

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:07.454
this one? We have X sub n plus 2 plus X sub n plus 2 plus 1. So, if this is the

00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:14.560
rank n divided by 2, n divided by 2 plus 1 is 3. And then, if we divide it by

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.816
2, we get the average of these two values. So here, we have our answer. And you

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:26.831
see that this value is this third one. Using this logic, we can extend these

00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:33.365
formulas for any even numbered data set. Okay, let's say that n is 5. So, we

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:40.760
have 5 values in order. Can we divide 5 by 2? No. If n is odd, then we can't

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.710
have a decimal rank. What about 5 plus 1 divided by 2? Well, that's 6 divided

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.744
by 2. And 6 divided by 2 is 3. So that means we would get the value in the

00:01:52.744 --> 00:01:58.406
third rank. And that is the median. Let's still explore the others. If we have

00:01:58.406 --> 00:02:04.735
5 minus 1 divided by 2, that gives us 4 divided by 2, which is 2. And the value

00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:09.726
in this second rank is not our median. And finally, we have 5 divided by 2,

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:16.379
which is 2.5, plus 1, which is 3.5. And again, we don't have a value that's

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.789
ranked 3.5, only integer values. This is probably kind of confusing. So before

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:27.525
we finish this solution, let's just apply this one to the Udacion's Facebook

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:35.320
friend data set that we had before. Remember, we had 27 values. So, we want the

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.600
value in the n plus 1 over 2 place. So if we plug n in, then we get 27 plus 1

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:51.794
divided by 2, which is 28 divided by 2, which is the 14th place. And then, when

00:02:51.794 --> 00:02:58.530
we looked for that value in the 14th way, we found that the median was 479.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.845
Hopefully, that makes some sense and that it's getting you more familiar with

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:04.883
using symbolic notation. Good Job.
