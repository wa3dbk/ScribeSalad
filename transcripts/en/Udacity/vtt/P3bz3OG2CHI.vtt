00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.990
Let's jump back into using git.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.660
What makes a git repository a repository?

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.820
Last lesson you interacted with an existing repository,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.360
the asteroids repository.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.580
For the most part it just looks like a normal directory on your machine.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.905
The only real difference is that git repositories store a bunch of

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:19.540
metadata about the history of the repository since it was created.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.430
We won't go into the details of how exactly this metadata is stored, but

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.840
where is less complicated.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.100
It's right here in the main directory.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.300
But it's tucked away in a hidden directory.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.890
Meaning that it doesn't show up in most file explorers by default.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.930
Hidden files and directories are often used for

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.730
data that the user doesn't need to directly interact with.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.630
These directories and files are only different from normal ones in that they

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.580
start with a period which tells the operating system to hide it from the users.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.670
One way to see these files is by going to the command line and using ls -a.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.230
In addition to all the normal files that you see when you type ls,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.270
when you do ls -a, you also see the hidden files.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.060
See, here, you have hidden .git.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.060
So, how does this hidden .git directory even get there?

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.256
Last time you cloned an existing repository,

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:05.440
which transferred all that metadata over to your computer.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.660
If you want to start from scratch,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.500
you'll need to explicitly tell git that you want to make a new repository.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.070
In the next video Caroline will show you how that works.
