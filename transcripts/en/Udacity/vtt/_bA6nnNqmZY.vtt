00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.180
Because accessibility is so
broad and the usership is so

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.020
diverse, we're going to need
a roadmap to guide us on our journey.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.140
Throughout this course we'll
be referring to WCAG, or

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.760
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
2.0.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.580
WCAG is a set of guidelines and best
practices which have been put together

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.650
by accessibility experts to try and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.990
answer the question of what
accessibility means in a methodical way.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.370
Several countries actually mandate
the use of these guidelines

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.035
in their web accessibility
legal requirements.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:37.900
WCAG is organized around
four core principles.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.220
The first is making sure
users can perceive content.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.240
This helps us keep in mind that just
because something is perceivable with

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.530
one sense such as sight, that doesn't
mean that all users can perceive it.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.330
Second, is it operable can users use
UI components and navigate the content.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.010
For example something which requires a
hover interaction cannot be operated by

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.590
someone who can't use a mouse or
is using a touchscreen.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.440
Third, can users understand the content?

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.940
Also, can all users
understand the interface and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.520
is it consistent enough
to avoid confusion?

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.610
And finally, is it robust enough for

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.490
the content to be consumed by
a wide variety of user agents?

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.460
And does it work with
assistive technology?

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.547
Together this forms POUR.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:25.810
While WCAG provides an extremely
comprehensive set of guidelines to help

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.140
us keep many facets of accessibility in
mind, it can also be a bit overwhelming.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.790
To help mitigate this, the Web aim group
has distilled the WCAG guidelines down

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.990
into an easy to follow checklist,
targeted specifically for web content.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.710
The webbing checklist can give you
a short high level summary of what you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.530
need to implement while also
linking to the underlying or

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.362
tag specifications if you
need an expanded definition.

00:01:50.362 --> 00:01:54.450
Both WCAG and the checklist cover
a lot of the accessibility space.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.860
The guidelines can only
ever be a limited proxy for

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.460
actual accessibility what actually
matters is the user experience.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.810
I'm just checking some box.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.740
So while these guidelines
give us a framework for

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.729
thinking about accessibility, there may
be places where they're incomplete or

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.450
even give advice which
is a little out of date.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.720
However, they're still
an excellent resource for

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.020
helping us integrate
accessibility into our process.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.860
With these tools in hand we can chart
a direction for our accessibility work,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.330
be confident that so long as our project
is meeting the outlined criteria,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.490
our users should have
a positive experience.
