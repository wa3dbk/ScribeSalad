It's good to not only monitor patients
but to provide them with help

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.170
to manage their health and
diseases more effectively.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.210
This is an area where PHR apps
may have a role in part because

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.440
they have access to information about
the patient that is stored in the PHR.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.840
The American Heart Association's
heart360 is an example that provides

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.720
a suite of capabilities including a
physician dashboard that brings together

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.710
data for all the patients using
the app and who are under their care.
