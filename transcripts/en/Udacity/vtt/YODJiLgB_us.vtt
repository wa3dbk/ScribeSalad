00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.870
The answer I got to this problem was 36 over 5. I can see though two very

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:08.085
different methods of going about solving this. So, let's look at each of those.

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:12.170
The first method would be to, right away, try to get all the variables on one

00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:16.560
side of the equation and all the constants on the other side. Then however, we

00:00:16.572 --> 00:00:20.526
have to deal with having a fractional coefficient for x for pretty much the

00:00:20.538 --> 00:00:24.599
entire problem. This isn't hard to deal with, it's just a question of what you

00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:28.615
prefer doing. To get rid of the fraction, I multiply by the reciprocal. This

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:29.639
method does give us the current answer, 36 over 5.
