00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.380
I mention that XFS uses log based

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.780
striping in software. So let's understand that technology

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.690
in a little bit more detail. You have clients on the local area network that

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.090
are writing to files. When a client makes a change to a file. The changes

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.930
that are made by this client to files are written to an append only log.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.410
And this append only log is a data

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.460
structure. This log segment is a data structure

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.460
in the memory of the client in the

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.410
distributed file system and this append only data

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.230
structure contains ,the changes made to files on

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.790
this client node. And for instance, this could

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.170
be a change for a particular file X, this could be a change for another file

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.070
Z and so on, and so forth. And this is an append only data structure that is

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.400
residing at this client. Similarly, there is a log

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.660
segment that is available at this client. For the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.080
changes made to files on this node, and when

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.970
this log segment fills up beyond a certain capacity,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.920
you decide on a certain threshold, and once that

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.240
threshold number of fragments have been written in this

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.320
log segment, then you decide that it's time

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.770
now to write to the disk. So you take

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.010
these log fragments,and compute the parity, which is the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.600
check sum or ECC, whatever you may want to call

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.030
it, and this becomes the log segment that I want to write to the disk.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.985
And you take this and stripe it across storage servers. So you take

00:01:36.985 --> 00:01:41.840
this,particular log fragment along with its ECC and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.720
stripe it on storage servers so that it is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.670
now available on the storage system and as I

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.470
mentioned, you want to do this periodically in order

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.730
to avoid the chance of [INAUDIBLE] Data loss due to

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.670
failures of a particular node, and that's what you're

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.990
doing every periodically. Same thing is happening on this

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.510
so if you look at the storage server, you

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.900
see that the storage server has the log segments that

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.169
have been written by this client, and the log segment

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.530
that has been written by the log segment that has

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.460
been written by this client. All of this, gets into

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.220
the storage servers, and the other thing that you want to

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.960
do is, you don't want every log segment to be

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.190
written on all the disks available on the local area

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.310
network, you don't want to do that. This again is

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.100
concerned with solving the small rate problem, and therefore, what we

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.060
want to do is subset the storage servers, and say if, let's say i have 100

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.890
storage servers available on the local area network.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.930
I might decide that every log segment is

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.240
going to write its log over a small fraction of that maybe 10 servers. And this

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.790
client may similarly choose a subset of storage

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.340
servers to write it on. The subset of storage

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.860
servers that is used for striping a given log segment

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.160
is called a stripe group, for that particular log segment.
