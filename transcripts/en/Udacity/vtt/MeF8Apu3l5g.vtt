00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.144
We had to take corrective action when we transformed normals by a scale matrix,

00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:08.395
needing the inverse transpose in the worst case. For rotation and translation we

00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:12.663
could use the same matrix for normals that we used for points. So the question

00:00:12.663 --> 00:00:17.278
to you is what happens to normals if they're transformed by the same mirroring

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:22.123
matrix used for transforming points? Your choices are the transforms works only

00:00:22.123 --> 00:00:26.597
if the normal is perpendicular to the mirror. The transform works only if the

00:00:26.597 --> 00:00:31.468
normal is parallel to the mirror. The transform works all the time, but you must

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:36.665
normalize the normal afterwards. Or the transform works all the time. If you

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:40.873
need a hint, think about Alice through the looking glass.
