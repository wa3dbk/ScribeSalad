00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.490
Okay, let's talk about
compositing a little bit more.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.470
Now I've got a page here, and what I
want to do is bring out a side nav.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.080
So what I normally do is I have one
layer in memory, and I just redraw

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.590
the pixels for the side nav, and
I do that for every frame of animation.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.450
So in the end we have one layer
here with the side nav drawn and

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.300
the page content behind it.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.522
Now, the problem with that is that
on every frame, I've been painting.

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:28.360
Instead, what we can do is a better
version of this, where we have

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.030
one layer with the page content in,
another layer with the side nav in.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.010
All we then need to do is slide the side
nav over the top of the page, and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.990
we get the same effect,
but without painting.
