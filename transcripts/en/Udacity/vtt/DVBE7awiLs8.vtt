00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.090
Let's see a multi tape
turning machine in action.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.420
Input always comes in
on the first tape and

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.660
all the heads start at
the left end of the tapes.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.990
Our task will be to duplicate
the input separated by a hash mark.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.190
So for example,
if the input string is 1, 0, 1, 1.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.731
We would want to turn that into
that same input followed by a hash,

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:26.647
followed by a copy of that same input,
1, 0, 1, 1.

00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:29.979
Of course we need to start
in some fixed initial state.

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.499
And the first thing we need to do, is to
mark the beginning of this second tape

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:36.740
since we're going to have
to rewind it at some point.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.870
So, regardless of what symbol
we read on the first tape,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.472
we're going to write a blank symbol
to the first slot on the second.

00:00:43.472 --> 00:00:45.999
By the way, I'm not going to write
out every transition as I draw

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:47.540
the state diagram here.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.020
Instead I'll just include
a description of the key transitions.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.910
Next, we walk forward on both tapes,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.800
copying the contents of
the first tape to the second.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.470
Once we hit a blank symbol
on the first tape, we stop.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.530
Then we write the separating
hash to the first tape.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.720
And next we want to
rewind the second one,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.190
keeping the head of the first tape
over the hash the whole time.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.100
We stop rewinding once
we hit that blank symbol

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.760
we wrote to the second
state in the first step.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.020
And now we're ready to start copying.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.540
And we keep doing so until this
head here hits the blank symbol.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.850
Once that happens we're ready to halt.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.870
We've taken this string here, put
a hash mark and then copied it past it.
