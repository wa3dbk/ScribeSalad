00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.320
The model that we will consider, is a very well

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.330
known one. Which is finite state machines. And you might have

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.320
seen them before. At a high level, a state machine is

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.990
a graph in which nodes represent states of the system. For

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.650
example, in this case, state 1, state 2, and state 3.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.950
Edges represent transitions between states. For instance, in this case we

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.850
have one edge from state 1, to state 2. That means

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.640
that the system can go from state 1, to state 2.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.530
And finally, the labels on the edges represent events

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.800
and actions. For example, what this label means is that

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.400
the system goes from state three to state two

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.140
when event five occurs. And when going from state three

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.190
to state two, it generates action four. And does

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.430
reacher model, sir reacher's kind of state machines, but we're

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.160
just going to stick to this ones which are enough. For

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.760
our purpose. So how do we build such a final

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.530
state machine starting from a specification? The first thing

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.660
we need to do is to identify the system's boundaries

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.250
and the input and output to the system. Once we

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.960
have done that, we can identify, within the boundaries of

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.070
the system, the relevant states and transitions. So we split

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.670
this single state We'll refine it into several states. And

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.640
we also identify how the system can go from one

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.830
state to another. Including which inputs cause which transition, and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.350
which result in outputs we can obtain. To

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.810
better illustrate that, let's look at a concrete example.
