00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.695
We can use a quadratic formula to solve this problem. First we put our answer in

00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:13.170
standard form, plug in 0 for y, and then substitute into the quadratic formula

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.318
to obtain our two solutions of 2 plus 3i and 2 minus 3i.
