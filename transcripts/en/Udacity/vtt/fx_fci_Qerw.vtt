00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.380
Welcome to lesson two.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.380
Now, at this point you should
have a list of ideas and

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.640
hopefully you have a preference for
one that you might want to build.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.470
If you don't, that's all right.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.205
Keep thinking about it,

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:14.585
because we're almost at the point
the point where you've got to choose.

00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:19.065
In this lesson, you'll develop a feature
list for each of your app ideas and

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:21.005
then you'll finally choose one.

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.570
Once you do, you'll build a paper
prototype, you'll start developing it in

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.935
Xcode, you'll find some bugs,
you'll squash those bugs,

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.978
then you'll probably find some more
bugs, and then you'll fix those.

00:00:31.978 --> 00:00:35.840
But then that'll probably create some
more bugs and then you'll probably just

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.210
want to throw your computer out
the window, because screw it.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.860
But we'll have some tips and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.110
tricks to help get you through that,
when you get to that point.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.560
I'll also still be prompting you
to reflect on your experience and

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.260
I hope you keep doing so.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.840
Particularly in the forums, because
both you and your fellow classmates

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.830
will probably need a bit of
encouragement in this development stage.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.240
Let's get started
