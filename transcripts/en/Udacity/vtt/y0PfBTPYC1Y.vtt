00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.721
The solutions for this equation were 2 plus or minus i. Great work if you found

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:09.510
these. We start by identifying the variables or the coefficients, a, b, and c.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.574
a equals positive 1, b equals negative 4, and c equals positive 5. We plug

00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:18.760
these into our quadratic formula using parentheses around each of the

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.030
variables. Here, we'll have the negative of negative 4, which is positive 4.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.932
Here, we'll have negative 4 squared, which is 16. And these three factors will

00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:32.580
give us a product of negative 20. Our denominator will be 2 from this product.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.504
And then, we simplify our radical to get the square root of negative 4. The

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:41.200
square root of negative 4 is 2i, and then we can factor a 2 from our numerator.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.762
So we can simplify one last time. 2 divided by 2 equals 1, and we're left with

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:47.650
2 plus or minus i.
