00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.660
Since we rounded to the nearest 10th of a foot, our gasoline height, our level,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.981
would be 2 and 7 10ths of a foot. Amazing work if you found that one. We start

00:00:08.981 --> 00:00:13.076
setting up out proportion by looking at the number of gallons, the height, and

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:17.400
the square of the radius. We know the number of gallons varies directly with the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.479
height of the gasoline level and the square of the radius. Since it varies

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:25.637
directly with these two amounts, we want to make sure we list those both in the

00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:29.884
numerator. And the square part is really tricky. You want to make sure that you

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:33.916
square this radius. Once we have this proportion we can plug in the values for

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:38.600
each case and solve for the unknown. In one case the tank has a radius of five

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.755
feet, so we plug in five here. It holds 4,700 gallons, here and has a height of

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:49.086
eight feet. So the height one is eight. In the second case, we're looking for

00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:54.207
the height of the gasoline level so that will be H. At some unknown height, H,

00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:59.016
the radius will be four feet, so the second radius is four. And the number of

00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:03.741
gallons that the tank will hold will be 1000. So gallons 2 is 1000. Now, we want

00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:09.739
to solve this equation for h. We square the 5 and the 4 to get 25 divided by 16.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:14.798
Next, we multiply these 2 fractions together to get 200 in the numerator, and

00:01:14.798 --> 00:01:19.060
16h in the denominator. We cross multiply to get this equation. And then,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.514
finally, we divide by the coefficient of x to get our final answer. We get a

00:01:23.514 --> 00:01:27.640
decimal for our answer and we want to round to the nearest tenth. Because the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.838
value next to the 6/10 is a 5 we round up. If this value was less then a 5 then

00:01:32.838 --> 00:01:38.217
we round down and keep our answer as 2 and 6/10th. But for 5 or greater we round

00:01:38.217 --> 00:01:43.516
up so we get 2 and 7/10. This is the level for our gasoline take that holds a

00:01:43.516 --> 00:01:46.688
thousand gallons and has a base rate of 4 feet.
