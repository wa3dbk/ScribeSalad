00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.390
How do we implement access control
using the access control matrix?

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.440
This is what we want to discuss.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.510
So first of all the access control
matrix is going to be pretty large.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.560
There could be tons of resources,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.530
depending on what kind
of system you have.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.190
If it's a large shared server
there could be lots of users.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.960
So it's a large matrix, but we know that
the matrix is going to be fairly sparse.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.930
So sparse matrix here really means
that many of the entries in the matrix

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.045
are going to be null.

00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:32.630
because most users not going to
have access for a given resource.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.271
Resource is owned by somebody.

00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:36.095
He or
she's going to have access to it and

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:38.565
maybe they choose to share
it with a few other people.

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:43.335
So the question is how should we
represent this matrix in the system?

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:46.915
Actually sparse matrices
represented in one of two ways.

00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:50.315
You can represent them either
sort of column measure or

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:54.020
row measure and that's something
we can do here in this case.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.550
So we can focus on each
column of the matrix, and

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.860
if most of the entries are null
we can just ignore those and

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.640
we can make a list that says,
well for object Oi,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.198
user ui1, this user's access
rights are this value.

00:01:11.198 --> 00:01:18.000
Okay, so we have these entries, so when
I said matrices, when they're sparse,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.680
they can be implemented
through link list for example.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.200
So this could be a list of, and it's
going to have a small number of entries.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.795
Because most users don't have
any access for object Oi.

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:31.655
So if a given user has access,
what kind of access we can have,

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:35.441
sort of this pair, and
then the user id, and access rights,

00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:38.210
that makes up the first
node in our list.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.530
Next user is going to be ui2, who has
some other set of rights, and so on.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.840
So we can just go down the column and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.905
see what users actually have
known null access rights.

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:54.280
And build these entries,
that become nodes in a link list or

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.320
something like that.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.080
So we can organize this information
either by a resource or an object.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.900
Here we'll have to keep track of what
users have access to this object, and

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.410
what kind of access they have for
this object.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.280
So that's one way to do it.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.220
When you do that,
this list I'm talking about, or

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.055
the data structure that we're talking
about which is this collection,

00:02:14.055 --> 00:02:15.900
this linked list kind
of a data structure.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.570
That's a collection of these entries,
what user has what access rights.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.570
This is called an access control list or
an ACL.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.170
So if you focus on a resource or
object Oi and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.760
grab the information who has
access to this resource and

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.660
what kind of access, that defines
an access control list or ACL.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.450
To keep in mind is that ACLs are for
resources we have in the system.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.330
So ACL is always associated
with an object or a resource.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.720
There's another way to think about
how we can implement it, and

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.410
rather than focusing on columns,
we can focus on rows.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.960
And we know that rows
correspond to users.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.190
So we can go down horizontally,
you know, across a row and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.230
say, what would we see.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.010
If it's a sparse matrix, this user
ui is not going to have access for

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.410
most of the objects.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.950
But he or
she will have access to some objects.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.720
So the first object we run into for
which ui has access is this object oi1.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.850
So the list we are going
to generate here,

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.020
which is going to say for this given
user ui, we do have access and

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.830
these are the access rights for
object oi1.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.154
The next object for which we have
access, or this user ui has access is

00:03:26.154 --> 00:03:31.410
oi2 and those access rights
are defined by rights2 and so on.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.100
Basically we are ignoring
the null entries in the row, and

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.330
the entries that are not null are for
certain objects.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.930
So these are those objects,
and what kind of access for

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.930
each of those objects,
that's what we capture in this list.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.140
Well, this kind of a list is
called a capability-list,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.360
in some sense what a user is capable of.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.300
A user is capable of accessing oi1
in this manner, oi2 in that manner,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.050
so it's called a capability-list
that is for a given user ui.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.370
Remember, ACLs are for an object,
capability-lists are for a user.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.790
Again, C-list is going to be associated
with each user we have in the system.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.400
Remember, we have a row in
the access control matrix for

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.220
each user, and
each row really is a C-list.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.600
It's a list representation
of what's in that row.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.010
So, C-list are for users.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.560
ACLs are for objects.
