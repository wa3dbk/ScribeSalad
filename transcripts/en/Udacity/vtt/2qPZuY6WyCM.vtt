00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.700
Let's discuss more about
network IDS deployment.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.530
Here's an example enterprise
network configuration.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.230
The internal network
has multiple subnets.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.300
And the enterprise has public-facing
services, such as a public web server.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.530
Recall our lecture on firewalls.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.500
We typically want to place
an external firewall

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.280
to protect the entire
enterprise network.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.929
In addition,

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.740
we want to protect the internal network
from the public-facing servers.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.640
These servers are put in what we
call a DMZ and we use internal

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.530
firewalls to monitor traffic between
the internal subnet and a DMZ.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.560
The internal firewalls also monitor
traffic between its subnets.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.470
So that's the deployment of firewalls,
but what about IDS?

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.550
A common location for an IDS sensor
is just inside the external firewall.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.570
This position has
a number of advantages.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.670
Obviously, you can see attacks
from the outside world.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.000
By comparing the logs of the firewall
and the IDS, we can also

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.430
find out whether the firewall had missed
an attack that it should have prevented.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.410
The IDS at this location can also
detect attacks that are targeted at

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.240
the public facing servers.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.290
In addition, because it can analyze
all outgoing traffic of the entire

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.510
enterprise network, it can also detect
attacks from a compromised server,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.790
either from DMZ or the internal network.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.420
A network IDS can also be placed between
the external network and the Internet.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.710
The main advantage of this location
is that the network IDS can see

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.620
all attempted attacks to
the enterprise network,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.334
including those attacks that have
been filtered by the firewalls.

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:40.780
For example, if the firewall is
overloaded, you would not only drop

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.928
the incoming packet, it may not even
have resource to log this packet.

00:01:44.928 --> 00:01:48.600
But an IDS at this location
can see the packet and log it.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.870
Therefore, the IDS can see
all attempted attacks.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.980
In addition to deploying
network IDS at the perimeter,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.190
we can also deploy a network IDS to
protect a subnet or set of servers.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.299
A network IDS at this location can
perform more detailed analysis of

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.246
traffic data.

00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:08.156
Because compared with a network
IDS at the perimeter,

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:10.370
it has smaller amount of traffic volume,

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.660
due to the fact that it only monitors
traffic to a subnet and the servers.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.680
In addition, it can also detect
intrusions from inside the network.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.680
In addition to protecting the servers,
a network IDS can also be placed

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.590
to protect the workstations or networks
of important personnels or departments.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.900
A network IDS at this location can
focus on targeted attacks, for

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.990
example, attacks that are targeted
at financial transaction systems.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.490
Compared with an IDS at
the network perimeter,

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.100
which must examine traffic to
the whole network, an IDS at

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.150
this location can instead focus on
traffic to these high-value systems.
