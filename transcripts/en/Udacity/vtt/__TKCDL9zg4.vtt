00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.110
All right.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.033
So we've decided that we'll be getting
the earthquake data from the USGS

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:06.431
earthquake catalog API.

00:00:06.431 --> 00:00:09.255
And we've got some polished
user interface designs for

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:13.350
our app from our designer,
which means we're ready to get started.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.815
So let's talk about the journey,

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:18.320
we'll be referring to this course
map to track our progress.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.390
In lesson one,
we'll explore the USGS site and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.840
figure out how to request
the data that our app needs.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.420
We'll also learn about the structure in
which the data is returned to us, and

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.780
compose a plan for extracting that
data programmatically in code.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.350
In lesson two, we'll start to unpack
the concepts you need to understand

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.830
in order to get information from
the Internet into an Android app,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.630
things like permissions on Android,
and doing work on a background threat.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.100
In lesson three, we'll dive into the
whole part if the networking topic and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.910
you'll understand that end to
end path of an http request.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.120
Then we'll update our quick report app
through quest data in the USGS real time

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.120
and display the most recent earthquakes
in the world within the app.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.060
Okay, let's take a closer
look at lesson one.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.160
In this lesson, we'll start building our
quake report app in incremental stages.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.780
After you've spent some time
familiarizing yourself with USGS API,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.540
we'll begin to prepare our app to
handle the earthquake information we're

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.920
interested in displaying.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.381
You'll import some code that we
provided to get you started and

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:17.000
practice becoming
familiar with code base.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.090
Next, you get some focused Java practice
by writing some utility functions

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.710
that will be key to extracting and
formatting the metadata

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.870
that we want to display about
each earthquake in our list.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.680
You will then transition
to learning how to properly

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.580
post the JSON structure contained
in http response from the server.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.570
And to do this we'll take
a sample response and copy and

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.400
paste it into the app, pretending that
we got the response from the internet.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.990
In the latter half of the lesson, we'll
update the list item layout to display

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.220
the key meta information about each
quake, things like the magnitude,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.120
location details, date and time.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.290
This will mostly be a review of
concept from the last course, but

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.920
this will form a nice foundation so

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.880
we can dive deeper into networking
on Android shortly after.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.080
We've got a lot to cover, but
after completing this lesson we hope

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.860
you feel comfortable exploring the
Internet for external data resources and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.660
approaching a Web API to figure
out how to request data using it.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.289
Let's get started.
