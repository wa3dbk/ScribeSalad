00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.482
Let's look more closely at these two number puzzles. I put the first two here,

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:08.882
and the second two here. In our number puzzles, these were the products. So

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:13.292
explain the observation: if the product is negative, what's true about the

00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:18.077
factors, and if the product is positive, what's true about these factors? Check

00:00:18.077 --> 00:00:20.780
all the statements that are true in each case.
