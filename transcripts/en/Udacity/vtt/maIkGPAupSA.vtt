00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.082
You've mastered scientific notation for getting these right. If you had trouble

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:08.042
with one or two of them, that's okay too. For this number, the a value would

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:11.996
need to be 2.389, and I would have to move this decimal five places to the

00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:16.282
right, to get back to my original number. This number is also really large, so

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:20.188
we know we're going to need a positive power. If I think about moving this

00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:24.620
decimal 12 places to the right, I end up with my original number. The last one,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.919
the decimal point needs to come after the 7. So if it were after the 7, I would

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.404
need a negative exponent to move this decimal back to the left 7 spaces, and I'd

00:00:33.404 --> 00:00:38.112
get this number. And we now multiplying by a negative power 10 really divides

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:41.238
this by a power of 10, so our number becomes smaller.
