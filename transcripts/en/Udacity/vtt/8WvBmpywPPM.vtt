00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.626
So I think this leaves us in a position
where we can actually state the TD(1)

00:00:03.626 --> 00:00:04.630
update rule.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.830
So it looks a little hairy, but we're
going to be able to go through it and

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.820
see that it does something very
sensible, or at least somewhat sensible.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.380
So this is the structure of the rule,
of TD(1).

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.050
So for each time we start a new episode,
we're going to initialize this thing

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.620
called the eligibility,
e(s) for all the states, to 0.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.300
So we just start them off as
ineligible at the start of the episode.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.120
And we start off our estimate for
the value function for this episode,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.110
to be initialized to whatever it was
at the end of the previous episode.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.940
&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.784
&gt;&gt; So then, each time we take a step
within the episode, a step from some

00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:43.133
St-1 to some state St, getting reward
rt, what we're going to do is first,

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.998
update the eligibility of
the state that we just left.

00:00:46.998 --> 00:00:50.997
Then go through all the states, compute
this one quantity which is the same for

00:00:50.997 --> 00:00:53.430
all states,
this is the temporal difference.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.870
This is the sum of the reward
plus the discounted

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.260
value of the state that we just got to,
minus the state that we just left.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.250
And we're going to use the values that
we had from the previous iteration,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.480
previous episode.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.060
That's going to be our
temporal difference.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.070
And we're going to apply that
temporal difference to all states,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.070
proportional to the eligibility
of those states,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.200
and of course the learning rate,
because we don't want to move too much.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.880
And we're just going to
update them by that.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.440
We're going to increase them by
this temporal difference times

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.490
the eligibility.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.860
Then we decrease, or decay,
the eligibility for those states.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.280
And then we're back up to the next step.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.437
&gt;&gt; Okay it's got all
the right letters so

00:01:31.437 --> 00:01:34.280
I think I can imagine that
this will do something.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.750
So, the for all S part, does that
have to be done in specific order?

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.032
&gt;&gt; No, because the S's are all
being done in parallel here.

00:01:44.032 --> 00:01:48.010
So the value at state S is going to be
updated based on this quantity, which is

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.566
the same for everybody, doesn't depend
on which S we're currently updating, and

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:56.570
this quantity which is specific
to the S that we're looking at.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.440
So it's all kind of happening
in parallel without any

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.690
dependencies between them.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.786
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, I see.

00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:06.041
So because there's an order to the
states and the way we're going to visit

00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:10.270
them, you basically get to see that
value kind of applied everywhere.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.875
Okay, okay, I think I understand.

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:12.715
&gt;&gt; Okay, all right,

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:16.715
so let's kind of step this
through in a tiny little example.

00:02:16.715 --> 00:02:18.345
And then see the magic of it,

00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:21.935
see that it actually produces the same
outcome that we would have gotten with

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:23.995
the update rule that had
talked about previously.

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:24.495
&gt;&gt; Okay.
