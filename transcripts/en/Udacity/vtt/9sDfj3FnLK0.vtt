00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.850
Great, you've learned how to package
applications in a container images.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.160
Which means you can now use tools like
Docker to not only distribute them, but

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.740
run them on a large range of machine.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.260
This unlocks the doors even
more advance automation.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.540
Now you have the power to abstract
away the gory details of packaging and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.870
running your application on
specific operating systems.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.630
Now you can focus on shipping your
ideas and making your users happy.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.360
But this is just the first step.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.570
Until now we've been working
on a single machine.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.440
But if we're limited
to a single machine,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.820
we're not going to be able to meet
the demands of today's users.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.050
So how can containers be coordinated,
distributed, and managed that scale?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.732
And at a even more fundamental level.

00:00:39.732 --> 00:00:42.670
Should we even be talking about
running specific containers on

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.260
specific machines?

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.030
What's really important is that
our application itself is running,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.061
delivering value and
being monitored and maintained.

00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:53.750
And to do that we'll be using
a platform called Kubernetes to manage

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.610
all that complexity.
