00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.626
There is no correct answer for which is better, a left-handed or a right-handed

00:00:04.626 --> 00:00:08.646
one of the other. May be more convenient for people or intelligent rabbits,

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:13.120
depending on a situation. One other area in computer graphics where opinions

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.260
vary is whether the y-axis or the z-axis should be on the up direction.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.600
Architects tend to think in terms of floor plans, so the x and y-axes, our

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.612
directions on the ground, and z is then the height. However, another common way

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:31.010
to think about coordinate system is with respect to our display. Looking at a

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.784
monitor and starting on the lower left-hand corner, the x-axis goes to the

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:39.949
right, the y-axis goes up. If we want to present a right headed coordinate

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.114
system with respect to the monitor, the z-axis then points towards us. We'll see

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:48.097
this type of definition in a later unit where we cover how to define a camera.

00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:53.142
The difference between these two coordinate systems is just a 90 degree rotation

00:00:53.142 --> 00:00:57.562
along the x-axis. So, it's easy enough to fix. We'll talk about rotations in a

00:00:57.562 --> 00:01:01.648
later unit, too. However, you've now been warned. If you read in some models

00:01:01.648 --> 00:01:05.534
some day into your program and the object is sideways, it's probably because the

00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:08.673
models up direction is different than what you're expecting.
