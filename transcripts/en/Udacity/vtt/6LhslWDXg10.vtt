00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One of the trickiest things about testing software is that it's hard to know when you've done

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
enough testing and the fact is, it is really easy to spend a lot of time testing

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and to start to believe that you did a good job and then to have some really nasty bug show up  

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that are triggered by parts of the input space that we just didn't think to test.  

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So let's look what's really going on, so we're going to start with the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
domain range diagrams that we known off.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We're going to have some test cases into domain and after a while

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we're going to start pretty good about what we're been doing. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What's going to turn out is without really knowing it, our testing is being compliant to some small part   

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
of the input domain and the problem, is that even the small part of the domain may contain    

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
an infinite number of test cases or else a finite numbers of test cases

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that is large enough that its for practical purposes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's not distinguishable from infinity and of course what's going on is we're going to do test cases

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
other parts of the domain we didn't think to test, putting the results and outputs that are not okay.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It really depends on how we've broken up the input domain.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
For example, let's think about the case that we're testing Therac-25 radiation

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
therapy machine that I used an example in the last lecture.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's not might be the case but all of the inputs that we are going to test, the once in this region   

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
are the once where we happened to type the input to the machines slowly. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We simply didn't realize that there's a whole other part of the input space

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that has to be treated differently that happens when we type the input fast and of course       

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
its in that region where we triggered the raised conditions that we're leading to massive overdoses.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Similarly, if you remember from lecture one, 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
we have a small Python program called the Python runtime to crash. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The distinguishing feature of it seem to be a large number of cascaded if statements.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It's pretty easy if we're testing Python programs to remain in the part of this space where for example  

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we have &lt;5 nested in these statements. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Over here is another region containing programs with 5 of more if statement nested and these are ones

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that cause for example, the Python virtual machine to crash.  

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
To take an even more extreme example, let's say that we're testing some software 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that somebody has inserted in the back door in. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Well in that case, there's going to be an absolute infinite test of all part of the input domain.  

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Maybe wherever here that triggers the back door cause remember if your putting a backdoor in code    

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
you don't want to trigger it accidentally and that's going to lead to something 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
extremely bad happening over here.  

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We didn't tested inputs triggering the  back door because we just didn't know it was there.  

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So what we'd really like is some sort of a tool or some sort of a methodology 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that if we are in fact testing only a small part of the input domain for a system what we really like  

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
is some sort of an automated scoring system that looks at our testing effort and says to us     

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
something like, your score is 14 out of 100.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Your not doing a good job testing the system. Keep trying. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And that's what today's lecture is going to be about.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It turns out there's a lot of reasons we do not want to know the sign of score to our testing effort.  

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Probably the main one is that this helps us find part of the input domain that need more testing. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So for example, if we can increase our score by testing this part of the domain, 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
we're naturally going to be led to do that and our testing efforts will improve. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Other reasons to assign a score to a testing effort are that we might be able to argue to a boss

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
which is some sort of a certifying authority that we've done enough testing. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Similarly, we might want to argue that the system we're developing has not been tested well enough  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
but its not yet safe to deploy and that it needs more testing and a testing score can provide 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
a numerical justification of that sort of way.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Probably, it would be nicer if we could take a large test suite one maybe that takes several days to run   

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and identify parts of the test suite that are completely redundant.    

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
That is to say parts of the test suite that tests exactly the same parts of the input domain.   

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Even though they occupy parts of the input domain have roughly the same testing effect on the system    

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
to assigning a score to our testing efforts and let us do that as well.
