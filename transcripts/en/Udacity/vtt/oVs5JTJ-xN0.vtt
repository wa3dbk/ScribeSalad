00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is the second one. The first one doesn't make sense.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Since there is nothing to match KUs against, this is what the certificate is protecting.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's ensuring that the client learns the right public key for the server.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The second one is our goal.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We want to know that the certificate matches the domain that we're connecting with.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Then we can trust that that's actually a public key associated with that domain.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The other two could possibly work, but they would require an extra round of communication.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They'd require the certificate authority being online.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If we could obtain the key directly from the certificate authority, we wouldn't need this step.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We'd talk to them in the first place.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The appeal of sending the certificate is we don't need the certificate authority to be online

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
or add an extra communication to another place when we connect to the server.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The server can store it's own certificate and send it to clients when they need it.
