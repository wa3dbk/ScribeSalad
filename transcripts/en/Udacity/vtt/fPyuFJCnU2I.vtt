00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.515
In the next lesson, we'll be looking
in more detail at the technologies for

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:07.939
aggregating data from diverse EHRs.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:13.280
A specific example is BioSense 2.0,
a system developed at the Centers for

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.850
Disease Control and Prevention,
the CDC, here in Atlanta.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.680
An often cited example of
the use of this technology

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.140
is the Tarrant County Public Health
Department in Fort Worth, Texas.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.250
Which uses it to collect and analyze
data from 60 regional hospitals for

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.100
a key and foundational role
that public health plays.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.820
Syndromic surveillance,
monitoring for disease outbreaks.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.660
Here you see as an example a time
order display of the number of visits.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.480
Typically these would be
emergency department visits for

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.370
a particular clinical problem.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.800
The capability to produce this in
a timely manner across an entire region

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.910
is a powerful surveillance tool
