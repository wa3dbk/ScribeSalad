Before explaining how projection works, let's talk about how the perspective

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:07.800
camera is set in 3Js. It's similar to the Orthographic Camera, in fact, the

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.724
creation call has few parameters. We know what the last three are. The aspect

00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:16.027
ratio is the image width divided by height, followed by the near and far

00:00:16.027 --> 00:00:21.715
planes. Remember the view frustum? It's back at last. The near and far

00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:24.685
distances are measured from the tip of the pyramid, where the camera is placed,

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:29.065
down a central axis. Back when I was a young man, we called near and far by the

00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:33.844
names hither and yon, which I think is more poetic. You'll still occasionally

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:37.450
see the terms hither and yon used in products, so keep an eye out. The first

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.084
argument for the perspective camera is the field of view. This is the angle

00:00:41.084 --> 00:00:45.470
between the top and bottom planes of the view pyramid. Notice that in 3JS, this

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.850
number is specified in degrees, unlike many other angles, which use radians.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.905
The field of view along with the aspect ratio fully described the locations of

00:00:52.905 --> 00:00:57.068
the four sides of the pyramid. For the orthographic camera, we define the

00:00:57.068 --> 00:01:01.410
location of every side of our volume box. Here the view is assumed to be

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.030
symmetric around the central axis. In other words, instead of, a top an a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.960
bottom value, we need just a single angle describing both, the field of view.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.522
Same thing with the right an left, the aspect ratio along with the angle is

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:17.390
enough. This is 3.js's way of doing things, an 99.9% of the time it's what you

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.540
want. That said, it's entirely possible to specify each side of the pyramid.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.404
And webgl itself has a frustum that does just this. If you later change values

00:01:27.404 --> 00:01:30.628
on the camera itself, such as the field of view near or far planes, in 3js you

00:01:30.628 --> 00:01:33.956
need to call camera, update projection matrix in order to have these changes

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:39.062
take effect. For most demos these camera parameters are usually set once on

00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:42.377
creation and rarely touched, so 3js doesn't spend any time checking them each

00:01:42.377 --> 00:01:47.371
frame. If you change these values while running your program, calling update

00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:50.311
projection matrix has three js evaluate these parameters and form a new

00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:52.470
projection matrix.
