Okay. So I went ahead and added the code to get the profile, and you'll be doing

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.790
that yourself in just a minute. Before we run

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.980
getProfile, gotta quickly run saveProfile, to make sure we

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.040
actually have a profile to get. I'll save the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.600
profile. And you see that the response shows that

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.890
the profile was created, hopefully saved. So now let's

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.710
try out getProfile. So I will execute this. And

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.590
yes, we got the profile. That means the getProfile method is working great.
