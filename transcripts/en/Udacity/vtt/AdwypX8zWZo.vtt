00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's start with the output of that software.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For reference, this is the result of the forward Euler method with a step size of half a day.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You already saw that the Euler method had step sizes of 2 or more.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But there's a price to pay for the stability of the backward Euler method.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The code gets really complex as opposed to the code of the forward Euler method.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You really do need pencil and paper to derive these equations. That's what we're going to do now.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The equation for R, the number of recovered persons, is the easiest one.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We'll start with that and to save space let me write under score 1 for the current quantities

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and subscript 2 for the quantities of the next step.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The forward Euler method would turn this into the following.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The value of R one step later is the current value of R plus step size

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
times the current rate of change, which is 1/5 days times the current value of I.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I₁ in my new notation.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This would be the forward Euler method but now we're concerned with the backward Euler method,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which means that we have to use the rate at the end of that step meaning I₂ has to go in here.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And now we're done. We know the current value of R.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We have computed the next value of I in the lines before,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and that's all we need to compute the next value of R.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Next up is S. If we were using the forward Euler methods, this would work as follows.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The next value of S is its current value plus the time step times its current rate of change

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.000
meaning -5x10⁻⁹ per day and person times I at the current step and S at the current step

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
if we were doing forward Euler.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But now that we're doing backward Euler, this has to be I one step after that

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and S one step after that.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We bring this down to the left hand side because we're interested in S₂ and we factor out S₂.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So the factor of 1 times S₂ and now it's plus this coefficient times I₂ times S₂.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.000
5x10⁻⁹ divided by day person I₂ and all that remains on the right hand side is S₁

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and now that is simple to solve.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
S₂ equals S₁ divided by the very same expression that we've got here.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I'm lazy. I don't spell it out. This completes the computation of S₂ for which we need I₂.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But we have computed that in the line before.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And now the equation for the rate of change of I, the number of infectious persons.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Those persons that is infected persons become infectious with a certain time constant

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and infectious persons recover with another time constant.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
If we were implementing forward Euler, it would be doing the following.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I₂ the value of the next step equals the current value plus the time step

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000
times the current rate of change, which is 1/1 day E₁ minus 1/5 days I₁

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
but now we want to implement the backward Euler method,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
which means that we have to use the values for the next time step and this rate of change.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I bring this term with the I₂ over to the left hand side and factor out the I₂.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
This leaves me with one I₂ plus h times 1/5 days.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
On the right hand side, I₁ remains and h times 1/1 day and E₂ remains.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And now we can divide by this expression and find I₂ equals the right hand side

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000
divided by this expression I₁ plus h times 1/1 day times E₂ divided by this expression.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
This completes the equation for I.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The main message here is that implicit methods come at a price.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Solving these equations can get very ugly.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
If you are convinced at this moment, you may want to skip the rest of the segment.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Otherwise, stay with me to see how we can compute E₂,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
which by the way is needed to be able to compute I₂.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
A trick to find the value of E for the next time step

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
is to look at these two differential equations and parallel.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
For the first one, the backward Euler method says the value for the next time step

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000
is the value for the current time step plus the time step times our estimate of the rate of change

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:49.000
for the next time step which is 5x10⁻⁹ per day and person times I₂ S₂ backward Euler

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
minus 1/1 day E₂ backward Euler again and not E₁.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And for S the new value is the old one plus the time step times

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000
minus our coefficient 5x10⁻⁹ per day and person times I₂ S₂ backward Euler again  and that's it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000
If you now form the sum of these two equations, you'll get E₂ plus S₂ equals E₁ plus S₁.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
This ugly expression cancels with that ugly expression, and we are left with h times

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
minus 1/1 day E₂.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So this is what we have reached by now. E₁ the current value is known.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
S₁ the current value is known. We want to determine E₂, the next value.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
At this point, we do not yet know S₂.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But luckily enough, we derived an equation for S₂ to be for namely S₂ equals S₁ divided by

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:56.000
1 plus the step size times 5x10⁻⁹ divided by days and persons times I₂.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And we have an equation for I₂ that says I₂ equals I₁ plus step size times 1/1 day E₂

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
divided by 1 plus step size times 1/5 days.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
If you use this equation to express I₂ and then insert this result as S₂,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:25.000
you end up with an equation that contains E₂ and E₁ and S₁ and it can be solved for E₂.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
E₂ appears in three places and with a little edge ??? you can turn the resulting equation

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
into a quadratic equation which is the standard solution formula for quadratic equations.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The result is what you see in the code.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Hopefully, this is now really convincing that working with implicit servers

00:06:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
requires quite some effort with pen and paper.
