00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.870
Welcome to the course on jQuery.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.650
I'm excited to be able to take you through a quick tour of the jQuery library.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.180
Over 60% of the top 100,000 most visited websites take advantage of

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.700
jQuery's simple syntax and powerful DOM manipulation methods.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.740
In this course, you'll experience firsthand why jQuery's so

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.760
popular as you explore the features that it has to offer.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.190
You'll start by breaking down how the jQuery library is built with

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.500
JavaScript and what that means for your code.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.770
Then you'll dive into jQuery selectors and DOM navigation methods.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.040
This is probably the trickiest and most important part of learning jQuery.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.660
But once you've mastered selectors, you'll be parsing the jQuery documentation

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.370
to write simple and straightforward DOM manipulation code.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.825
There are a lot of quizzes in this course, so

00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:52.881
you'll have plenty of practice manipulating the DOM with jQuery as you go.

00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:54.160
Are you ready to get started?
