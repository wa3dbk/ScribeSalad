00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.360
In the last quiz, Athena at first, had a two hour window of time in which she

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.332
knew the train would leave the mountain view station. Niko also told her it was

00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:12.686
sometime between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. That was a pretty big window. Then, with

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:16.103
more information from the train schedule, she narrowed down that window to this

00:00:16.103 --> 00:00:22.390
tiny little yellow one, right here. Between just before 5 and just around 5:15.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.740
The schedule then, is going to help her guess a lot better when the train's

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.335
going to leave. And we can imagine that if she had even more information about

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:32.812
the trains travel from Sunnyvale to Palo Alto, she could narrow down this

00:00:32.812 --> 00:00:38.583
window even more. We can use this same method of starting zoomed out. And then,

00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:42.985
zooming in, closer and closer, to help estimate the location of zeros that

00:00:42.985 --> 00:00:49.500
don't occur at fractional or rational values of x. These are irrational zeros.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.848
So, here on the graph, for example, you can see that y is negative down here.

00:00:53.848 --> 00:00:57.703
But it's positive up here. We know that somewhere in this general region,

00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:02.290
there's a point where y equals 0. We can find that exact point by zooming in

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.760
closer and closer.
