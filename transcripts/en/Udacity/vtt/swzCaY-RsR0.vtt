00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.456
Here is the solution. All you have to do is call nextInt to get a number

00:00:04.456 --> 00:00:10.260
between zero and sides minus 1. And then you add 1 to it. And you get a nu,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.520
number between one and sides. Let's try it out. We'll make a die with six

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.049
sides. Call cast, get a three, four, and here's a six.
