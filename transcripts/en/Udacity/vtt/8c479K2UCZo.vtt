00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In Kalman filters we iterate measurement and motion.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is often called a "measurement update,"

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and this is often called "prediction."

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In this update we'll use Bayes rule, which is nothing else but a product or a multiplication.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In this update we'll use total probability, which is a convolution,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or simply an addition.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Let's talk first about the measurement cycle and then the prediction cycle,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
using our great, great, great Gaussians for implementing those steps.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Suppose you're localizing another vehicle,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and you have a prior distribution that looks as follows.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It's a very wide Gaussian with the mean over here.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now, say we get a measurement that tells us something about

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the localization of the vehicle, and it comes in like this.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It has a mean over here called "mu,"

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and this example has a much smaller covariance for the measurement.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This is an example where in our prior we were fairly uncertain about a location,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but the measurement told us quite a bit as to where the vehicle is.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Here's a quiz for you.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Will the new mean of the subsequent Gaussian be over here, over here, or over here?

00:01:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Check one of these three boxes.
