00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And the answer is the mean is 5 as before. It's 25/5=5. σ² is a bit more difficult to compute.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
135/N, which is 5, that happens to 27 - 1/N² which is 25 of this expression X².

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That's 25²--625 and of course, 25² divided by 25 is 25. The difference between 27 and 25 is 2.

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It's the same variance we had before, just computed a little bit differently.
