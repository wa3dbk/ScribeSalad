00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.750
Now, I take another sensor reading.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.800
By the way, I just copied over,
see the low, the density on the bottom.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.833
I just copied over,
that's the belief that the robot has.

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:10.810
The robot sees another hole.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.341
So that means p of z given x is
the same thing I had before,

00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:16.833
because I got the same
reading I had before.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:18.000
I saw a hole.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.667
And again, I multiply.

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:24.898
But this time, I multiply
the previous density by this and

00:00:24.898 --> 00:00:30.590
you'll notice now that the robot
has a lot of belief, okay?

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.834
That it's actually where it really is.

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:36.002
And the reason is,
is it saw a hole, it took a meter,

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.890
it took a step of two meters,
saw another hole.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.792
Megan's really hoping,
I don't go another two meters.

00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:44.236
I won't and just that amount
of information is enough for

00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:47.350
it to have a pretty good
belief about where it is.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.917
Okay?

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:51.148
There's still some probability
that it's over here,

00:00:51.148 --> 00:00:54.103
because if that previous
reading was just wrong and

00:00:54.103 --> 00:00:58.420
the current reading was right that
I might be there, same over here.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.625
If the current reading was right,
but the previous reading was wrong.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:03.820
No, the other way around.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.874
In, anyway, the, the idea's that it's,

00:01:05.874 --> 00:01:08.208
it's weighting these
different probabilities.

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:09.050
Okay?

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.500
And you could, you know, do it again.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.894
So you resample and
you move and you see here,

00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:16.926
we have the resample density where most
of its belief is in the right place and

00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:19.458
there's some densities there and
that's it.

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:22.800
And that's the way a particle
filter works, okay?
