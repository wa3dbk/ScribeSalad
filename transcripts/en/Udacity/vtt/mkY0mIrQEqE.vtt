00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.990
First, let's talk about how we make things collide. Now, our world consists of

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.890
beautiful pixels and so, let's determine whether two images collide based on

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.280
their pixel data. So, let's say you have these two objects in your game world.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.696
The first is 72 by 72 pixels and the second is 50 by 50 pixels, and you want to

00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:22.915
figure out if they have collided with each other. How many pixel comparisons do

00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:26.600
you need to calculate to determine whether these two objects have collided with

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.950
each other? Enter your answer in this text box.
