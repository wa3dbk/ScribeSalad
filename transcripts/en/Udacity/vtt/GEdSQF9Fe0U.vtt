00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.220
Now that we have to find P,

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.560
I want to illustrate how easy it can
be to recognize that a problem is in P.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.550
Recognizing that a problem is
not in P is a little harder.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.130
So for this exercise, assume that if the
group force algorithm is exponential, so

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.990
is the best algorithm.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.310
Consider a finite set of
integers written in binary.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.400
And I want you to check the problems
here that you would think are in P.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.090
Again, if there isn't an obvious
polynomial-time algorithm,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.770
assume there isn't one.
