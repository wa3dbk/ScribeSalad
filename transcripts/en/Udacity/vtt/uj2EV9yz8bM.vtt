00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.236
You should have gotten one eighth of a foot candle. Fantastic work for figuring

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:08.293
that one out. We want to start by setting up our proportion using inverse

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:12.558
variation. We know the intensity of light varies inversely as the square of the

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:16.832
distance. This means that for intensity one, the distance one needs to be

00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:22.133
squared in the denominator. We flip the second fraction. Now I think it's really

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:26.348
easy to make a mistake when plugging in these amounts. So I would make a list of

00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:30.248
the amounts and then write in the numbers or variables that go with them. We

00:00:30.248 --> 00:00:34.344
know intensity one is two-foot candles, and that's at a distance of five feet

00:00:34.344 --> 00:00:39.330
away. So intensity one is two-foot candles, and the distance one is five feet.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.116
We're looking for the second intensity. We don't know it so we use x. And this

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:48.840
intensity occurs at 20 feet from the light source. So we have 20 feet for our

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.482
second distance. We can use this list to help us plug in the values to get this

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:58.282
proportion. We'll leave two divided by x here, and then we'll have 400 divided

00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:03.717
by 25 here. We cross-multiply to get 50 equals 400 x, and then we divide both

00:01:03.717 --> 00:01:09.458
sides by 400. To get x is equal to 1 8th, 1 8th is this equivalent fraction. We

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:13.650
simply divide each number by 50. We saw for an intensity of light so we want to

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.883
make sure we put the correct unit. It was 1 8th foot candles.
