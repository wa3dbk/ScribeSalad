00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now that you've got a pretty good idea of the architecture decisions we made on Reddit

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and how we kind of grew the site and stored data differently over time,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
what I'd like to talk about is now we actually grew the site from a social point of view--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
how we got users and how we maintained the feel that Reddit has.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's hard for me or anybody to really take credit for growing Reddit,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because it's a social thing and even if Alexis and I started over today knowing everything

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we know now, it'd be very hard to get a site like Reddit off the ground.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Social websites require a little bit of magic to work, and we were fortunate enough to have it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We did a lot of very important things that I think helped,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
one of which was in the beginning Alexis and I submitted all the content.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If you go to our Reddit submission page now, it basically boils down to two fields.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In the early days it was just two fields.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You basically had a field called "URL," which is the URL of the site you were submitting,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and "Title," which was the title of that site, and that would be the link you submitted to Reddit.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If Alexis and I went to the page we had a third field called "User,"

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and we could type in a name here, and when we hit submit,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we would automatically register this user if that name didn't exist

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and submit the content as that user.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You'd go to Reddit in the early days, the first couple of months,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and there'd be tons of content.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I shouldn't say "fake content," but it was fake users. It was really all just Alexis and I.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That did two things, and I think this is important to any site where you want to have a community feel.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The first thing it did was it set the tone.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Websites have this kind of inertia, and we submitted content

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that we would be interested in seeing.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
That meant the content on Reddit, at least for us and for our peer group,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
it was good, interesting stuff.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We wanted a site with the most interesting content online, and s owe did our best to find it

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and then we submitted that content ourselves.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So when you show up to Reddit, you kind of know what the site is all about.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The other thing it did was it made the site feel alive.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Users like to feel a part of something.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
If they showed up to the website and the front page was blank,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
it just looks like a ghost town.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You don't want to live in a ghost town. You'd rather live in New York City. Most people would.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That's why New York City is so big and ghost towns, by definition, aren't.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
That was really fortunate, and I don't know what made us do this.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In hindsight it's really easy to say this was how it happened,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but at the time I think we were just embarrassed to have an empty website,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
so we submitted the content, and it worked.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I remember the first day a few months in when we didn't have to submit any content,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and that was such a magical day for us, because then we knew the site was working on its own.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It was really, really cool. It took a while to get there.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We really kind of had to will this into existence.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Another thing about the site is it didn't have any comments to begin with.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I don't know that this helped or hindered us. It was just we didn't get around to writing it.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I think the only thing I want to say here is that people look at Reddit,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and if you get into it you quickly realize that the comments are what makes Reddit work.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That's where the really incredible community lives.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And Reddit grew quite a bit before we even had a comment system.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
That came later, and it just kind of goes to show how it's not always obvious what

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the most important part of a site is, and it's better just to kind of get something online

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and start experimenting with it than to build the whole system out and have it fail.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We didn't have any categorization. What we wanted users to do was submit links.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We didn't want them to have to think about categories, think about tags.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Those are all decisions, and the more decisions you have the harder it is to interact with the site.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
We had categorization on the site--I should say--for about one day.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I added it one night, and Alexis took all the links that had ever been submitted to Reddit

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and categorized them, so when users came the next morning everything would be ready to go.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
One of our first investors and advisers was like why did you add categorization.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
That ruined everything. Get rid of it, so we did.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Alexis ended up--he wasted all of that time, but that was really good advice.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Not having categorization meant users could just show up and submit content.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The serendipity of the front page was really interesting.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Another thing we did was we didn't collect emails.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Every site on there had this signup process

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
where you'd have to like enter your email address and then confirm an email--

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
all those sets you have to do.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
One of those steps involves you actually leaving your browser to go to your email program

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
or go to Gmail or whatever just to become a member.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
If you want members and you want submissions, why would you add all the barriers

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
like required email addresses?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We figured we're not going to spam people. We don't have any emails to send.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Why would we need their email addresses? So we didn't collect them.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
That allowed users to register that much faster, I think, was a contributing factor to our ability to grow.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Another big thing we did was no censorship.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We didn't care what content was submitted to Reddit.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Unless it was like overtly racist, we just let it be, especially if it was critical to us.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
That created this kind of sense of community, this sense of trust.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
That's what ultimately, I think, allowed Reddit to grow to this tremendous size

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
is the users believed in us and wanted to be a part of this community.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
When we made mistakes, even when I goofed one the password hashing thing,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
for example, they would stick with us because they realized our heart was in the right place.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
We just wanted to make a site that was new and interesting .

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We didn't want to sell our users. We didn't want to ruin the site.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
We just wanted to have good content.
