00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.226
Cognitive agents too face the issue of how far to generalize.

00:00:03.226 --> 00:00:08.708
We can undergeneralize in which case what we learn is not very useful.

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:13.460
We can overgeneralize in which case what we learned may not be correct.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.710
For example, imagine that I was a Martian who came to your Earth.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.540
I saw the first human being, and I may undergeneralize and

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.390
say this specific person has two arms. That is not very useful because that is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.280
not applicable to any other human being. Or I may overgeneralize and

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.645
say everyone on this Earth has two arms. That may not be correct.

00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:36.940
[UNKNOWN] is a technique that allows convergence to the right level

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.500
of abstraction. This is also connected to the notion of cognitive flexibility.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.300
Cognitive flexibility occurs where the agent has multiple characterizations or

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.940
multiple perspectives on the same thing. As we saw in version spaces,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.630
the agent has several possible definitions for a concept that converge over

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.070
time. An alternate view is to come up with one generalization and

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.319
try it out in the world. See how well it works. If it leads to a mistake or

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.270
a failure, then one can learn by correcting that mistake.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.730
We'll return to this topic a little bit later in the class.
