00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We're going to use list comprehensions to help us write our parser.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We were introduced to them earlier,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and many computer scientists love list comprehensions

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because they allow you to state what must be true about a list

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and let the computer figure out how to get there.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Just to remind you a bit of list comprehensions.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We use the square bracket to say, "I'm making a list."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but instead of listing all of the elements directly,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I have some sort of formula.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What I really want is to take all of the elements in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
let's call each of those x.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I want my new list to be all of those squared, so x items x.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 should give us 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and down here in the output it does.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In list comprehensions we can also put little clauses or guards

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to only take some of the input list.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Let's say that I only want to square those numbers that are odd.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I write everything just the same as before, but at the end I put in this little guard

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that says "only yield this element if x modulo 2 is 1."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That is, if x is odd, if the remainder when dividing x by 2 is 1.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The second list only contains 1, 9, and 25 for the numbers 1, 3, and 5.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We had our little refresher on list comprehensions.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now we want to parse a string according to a grammar.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Let's say our grammar would look like this if we wrote it down on a piece of paper.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We need to encode it in Python. Here is one way to do it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm going to take all of the left hand sides of all of the rules

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and write them out as the first part of a tuple.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Then all of the right-hand sides, like open P close, becomes elements of a list--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
open P close.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Here my grammar had three rules, and here my grammar is a list of three elements.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The second element corresponds to my second grammar rule--

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
P on the left-hand side, P in the 0th position, open P close on the right-hand side,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
open P close in a list on the first position.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm going to need to do the same thing with parser states.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Here is how I might draw on in color on a piece of paper,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and here's how I'm going to encode it in Python. This is just one way to do it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We could pick a different way, but this is going to simplify our implementation.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
There are really four parts of our parsing state--

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
the left-hand side nonterminal, some list of terminals and nonterminals before the dot,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
some list after, and j.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The right arrow, the dot, and the word "from"--we always have to write them,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
so I don't need to store them. I'm not going to write down "from" every time.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We'll just remember it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm just going to make my state a 4-tuple,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
but instead of it being 1, 2, 3, 4, 1 will be the nonterminal on the left.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This will be a list of a and b, and there might be more things here,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
or there might be nothing at which point it's the empty list.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Three will be a list of things after the dot.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
There might be more things there, or again, there might be nothing,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
at which point probably we want to use reduction.

00:03:00.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Then j will just be some integer.
