00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.900
When you started programming,
you used the XML visualizer.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.760
The things you can do in the visualizer,
you can also do in Android Studio and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.460
a lot, lot, lot more.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.700
As such, Android Studio might
look a little bit complicated.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.500
But to start making a application,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.960
you actually only need to know
a few of the core functionalities.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.500
So really don't worry if you don't
know what every single button does.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.630
I still look things up, and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.350
I sure don't know what every single
button in Android Studio does.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.330
Okay, I'm going to go down here and
click the Text tab.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.987
Looking at this middle part of the
screen, I want you to think of this as

00:00:33.987 --> 00:00:37.900
being something similar to a document
editor such as Google Docs.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.780
In Google Docs, you open a file,
and you edit that file.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.200
In Android Studio, you open a project
which contains many files, and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.740
you can edit any of the files
within the project.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.270
If we go over here to the left-hand
side, we can see all the folders and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.570
files that are inside of our project.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.618
If I go over to a folder and click it,
it shows me the sub-folders.

00:00:57.618 --> 00:01:01.190
If I double-click a file,
it opens a tab for that file.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.230
Here's where you could edit the file.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.330
And the tabs across are for switching
back and forth between different files.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.970
I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.780
close this file that I just opened
by clicking the little x up here.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.230
As you're editing things
in Android Studio,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.135
it does the work of
automatically saving your work.

00:01:18.135 --> 00:01:20.897
Now if I do something really disastrous,
like whoops,

00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:23.423
I accidentally select all this and
then delete it,

00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:26.501
always remember that you can undo and
redo in Android Studio.

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:30.644
I'm going to undo that by going
up here to the menu bar, and

00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:32.418
clicking Edit &gt; Undo.

00:01:32.418 --> 00:01:34.945
And you can see right below
it that we have Redo.

00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:38.076
Alternatively, if you don't
want to use the menu bar,

00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:41.751
you can use the keyboard shortcut
Ctrl+Z, or on Macs, Cmd+Z.

00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.680
And to redo, it's Cmd+Shift+Z or
Ctrl+Shift+Z.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.520
Let's take a closer look
at the left-hand side here.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.050
Everything here combined
makes up your app.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.910
An app or an application on
Android isn't a single file.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.900
It's a collection of images,
layouts, and other code.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.580
Note that if you go up here,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.180
you can select a few different ways to
view the files and folders in your app.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.590
Project, in particular,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.970
shows you what the folders actually
look like on your computer.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.530
I'll click down a bit so you can see.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.610
All right, not to scare you, but when
you made your app there's actually a ton

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.550
of folders and
files that were generated for you.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.100
To simplify things, I usually just stick
with the Android view which is a little

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.820
easier to navigate.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.270
Now back when you made your project,

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.239
you chose where the project
was going to be saved.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.412
If you ever forget,
you can look up here at the menu bar,

00:02:29.412 --> 00:02:31.959
which reminds you where
your project is saved.

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.904
And if you're feeling particularly
brave, you should feel free to even take

00:02:35.904 --> 00:02:39.750
a peek at what this folder structure
actually looks like on your computer.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.831
For example, on a Mac machine,

00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:45.459
I could go to my home folder
&gt; Android Studio Projects.

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.680
And then I see this
HappyBirthday folder,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.640
and this contains all of the project
files and folders for the application.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.130
So if I were to delete this folder or
move this folder,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.970
it would really mess up things for
Android Studio.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.760
Okay, so what we're going to be working
with is the activity_main.xml file.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.170
It's located in the layout folder
because it contains XML that has

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.280
the design or
layout of your application.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.730
I'm going to double-click.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.740
Now the contents of this file
should look pretty familiar.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.970
It's very, very similar to the sort of
XML that we were writing in the lesson.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.654
One big difference are these
two attributes here.

00:03:20.654 --> 00:03:24.238
The xmlns attribute says that
we're working with attributes that

00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:27.376
are specific to Android development and
making layouts.

00:03:27.376 --> 00:03:31.560
XML is also used with websites,
storing data, and other applications.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.120
So we use this xmlns attribute to
specify that we're making things

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.870
particularly for Android development and
particularly for layouts.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.185
The fact that we use the word Android
here is also the reason that we put

00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:46.880
android: in front of all
the attributes that we use.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.920
If you'd like to learn a little bit
more about the xmlns attribute,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.230
you can check out the instructor notes.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.990
The important thing to know is
when you make a new application,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.570
these two things will be
automatically included.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.380
And you should include them in
any other layouts you make,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.030
otherwise your application won't work.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.134
All right, now down here, you're going
to see two tabs, the Design tab and

00:04:08.134 --> 00:04:08.918
the Text tab.

00:04:08.918 --> 00:04:11.659
And the Text tab is actually the tab
that you're usually going to be

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.138
working with.

00:04:13.138 --> 00:04:17.149
Over here on the far right, you'll see
that there's a button that says Preview.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.640
If you click on it,
it'll remove the picture of the phone,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.860
and if you click on it again, it'll
bring the picture of the phone back.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.730
This is a preview of what your
XML looks like on a phone.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.350
It's very similar to the XML Visualizer.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.880
I'm actually going to go ahead and
change the text attribute here to say,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.580
Goodbye World.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.350
Now if you do this on your own machine
and you zoom in here, let me do it now,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.080
you should see that the text updated
to say Goodbye World, pretty cool.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.180
If you click on the Design tab,
you'll see a drag and drop interface for

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.100
designing phone layouts.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.000
So for example, I could drag
things over into the application.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.790
Over here in this area
called Component Tree,

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.100
it's going to list all of
the different views that I have.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.330
If I click on a particular view,
down here in Properties, it shows me

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.160
all of the different attributes or
properties that I can change.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.310
This list can be pretty helpful for
discovering new layout properties.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.010
Also, if you right-click
on any of these properties,

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.150
such as this alignStart, it'll give you
an option to see the documentation.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.880
This design view is pretty helpful if
you're trying to quickly build a layout.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.650
But you get a lot more control over
exactly where different elements go

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.140
if you understand and
know how to write code.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.480
Since we don't really need any of these
additional options, and don't know what

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.320
a lot of them do yet, it's easier
to just stick with the Text tab.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.620
That concludes a quick
tour of Android Studio.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.300
Next, we'll work on
running our first app.
