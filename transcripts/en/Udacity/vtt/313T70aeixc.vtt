00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.880
Two sources of difficulty, when using your

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.920
product, are due to the lack of discoverability

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.930
and feedback, knowing what to do, then

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.620
wondering what happened. These two difficulties result from

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.310
the huge gulf between a person's goal and the means of achieving them, this is

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.330
called the gulf of execution. There's also the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.370
gulf between assessing the state of the world,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.670
and trying to determine if that state

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.710
matches the initial goal, and this is called

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.220
the gulf of evaluation. Figuring out what

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.080
actions are possible, during the gulf of execution,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.060
is all about discoverability. And knowing what

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.400
just happened during the gulf of evaluation is

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.940
about feedback. Ever buy a new product and then not know how to work it?

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.560
Well, likely because it lacks discoverability. Ever

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.230
stand at an elevator or pedestrian traffic light?

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.910
Pushing the button, but not knowing if the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.520
system noticed, so you push over and over

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.700
again, that's because of lack of feedback. The role of the designer is to help

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.980
people bridge the two gulfs, making the possible

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.920
actions discoverable and providing feedback along the way.
