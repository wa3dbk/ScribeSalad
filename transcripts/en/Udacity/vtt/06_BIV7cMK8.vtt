00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.960
We've evolved to recognize color and
shapes at a very basic level.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.970
Just as we saw how shape and
arrangement can tell us a lot.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.410
We also infer information from
an item's color and appearance.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.890
Color can tell us if
a particular food looks ripe or

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.170
rotten, if we should stop or go or
if our battery is running low.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.880
It can be used to direct attention or
imply hierarchy and structure.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.670
Material design encourages
you the app developer

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.970
to embrace bold
purposeful uses of color.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.185
Not just for aesthetics, but
to make your app easier to use.

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:34.985
The material design color pallet
includes a set of primary and

00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:38.185
secondary colors that can
be used across devices.

00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:42.045
One note on the material pallet is
that it is in no way restrictive.

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:44.405
These aren't the only allowed colors.

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:47.685
If you have established brand colors,
use them.

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:50.785
It is however a great hand
picked starting point

00:00:50.785 --> 00:00:51.845
that you can use to get going.
