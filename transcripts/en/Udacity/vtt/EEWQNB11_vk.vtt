Next, we're going to write a kitten class that

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.390
calculates the cuteness based on a kitten's age. We'll

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.680
say that kittens over six months old are

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.860
cute. We'll say that kittens between two and six

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.900
months, including exactly two months and exactly six

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.380
months, are super cute. And kittens under two months

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.260
old are not quite cute yet. They're still too

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.340
young and sort of look like aliens. There's some

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.670
code for the kitten class to get you

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.440
started. You should implement the get cuteness method
