00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.858
For this first rectangle, we have x times x squared. So that's just x cubed.

00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:09.947
Remember, we add the exponents, 2 and positive 1. For this rectangle, we have x

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:14.830
times 2x. So, the area's 2x squared. And this third rectangle over here is x

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.836
times 3, or 3x. Notice, we're really just distributing this positive x to each

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:25.124
of the 3 terms in the second trinomial. This leaves us with 3 new terms. Next, I

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:30.196
have 3 times x squared, which is 3x squared. For this next rectangle, I have

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:35.194
positive 3 times 2x, so I get 6x. For this last rectangle, we have positive 3

00:00:35.194 --> 00:00:40.180
times positive 3 which is 9. The sides of the rectangle give us an area of 9.
