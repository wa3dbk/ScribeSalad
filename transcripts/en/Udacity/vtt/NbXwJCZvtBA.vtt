00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.392
Since we have y plus 3, instead of just y, this graph will be shifted three

00:00:04.392 --> 00:00:08.626
down, from the graph of y equals x squared, and because we have x minus 2

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:13.675
instead of x, it'll be shifted two, to the right. Remember that when were adding

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:18.475
constant terms, whether it's next to y or next to x, we're shifting in the

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:23.291
negative direction along the respective axis. So since we're adding 3

00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:28.190
vertically, we're moving down and since we're subtracting 2 horizontally, we're

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.235
moving in the positive direction along the x axis.
