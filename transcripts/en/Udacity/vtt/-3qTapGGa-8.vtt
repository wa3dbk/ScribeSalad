00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The modification is simple.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We will call the procedure sense multiple times,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in fact, as often as we have measurements, which is the for loop over here,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we grab the kth measurement element and apply it to the current belief.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Then recursively update that belief into itself.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In this case, we run it twice. We print the output.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
For this specific example, we get back the uniform distribution.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
These are all 0.2s approximately.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The reason is we up multiplied each field once for the 0.6

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and down multiplied for the 0.2.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And these effects were in total the same for each cell.

00:00:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
As a result, we get the same output over here. It's quite remarkable.
