00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.660
So the answers is, we need to change the three of these procedures.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.610
We need to change crawl web, we need to change add to

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.210
index, and we need to change lookup. We don't need to change get

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.490
all links at all, that we can keep exactly the same as it

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.460
was. It just returns the list of links, it doesn't depend on the

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.590
index. We don't need to change add page to index. This is

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.220
a little more surprising since it depends on index, but because of the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.040
way we wrote add page to index, it calls add to index. So

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.490
it doesn't depend how we actually represent the index. It's going to go through

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.860
all the words add them to index by calling add to

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.780
index. So we don't actually have to change that code. We

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.060
do need to change the other two, so let's start with

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.770
crawl web and figure out what we need to do to

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.498
change this, to use a dictionary. And the change is actually

00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:48.570
going to be really small, right? The index is here, in the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.310
old version we initialize index to a list, to the empty

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.640
list And all we do with index is pass it in

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.540
to add page to index. So to change that to use

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.020
a dictionary, all we need to do is change the square brackets

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.620
to be curly brackets. So now, instead of starting with an empty

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.170
list, we're going to start with an empty dictionary. So that's the only

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.430
change we need to make to crawl_web. The change to add index

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.790
is going to be a little more complicated. And we can see from

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.920
the code to crawl_web, what happens with each page was that we

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.590
call add to index, passing in index, which is now a dictionary.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.400
Let's look at add_page_to_index. I claimed that we didn't need to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.620
change that. Here's the code to add_page_to_index. And it takes the index.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.500
It goes through the words. It adds each word to the index.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.960
We can do this just the same whether index was a list

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.000
or a dictionary. We don't need to change add page to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.270
index, we are going to need to change add to index. So

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.350
we are going to need to change the code to add to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.590
index and let's try to figure out how. So before we had

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.460
add to index, that takes an index, a keyword and a URL. We'll

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.470
still take the same parameters but what we had to do when it

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.810
was a list was go through all the entries in the index, check

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.120
for each one, if it matches the keyword we're looking for. If we

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.380
find that it does, then we add the URL. If we get to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.430
the end without finding it, then we append a new entry, which is

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.100
the keyword with a list of URLs containing just the first URL. So

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.870
let's figure out how to change this to work with the hash table index.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.130
So, the great thing about the hash table is we don't

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.280
need to loop through anything now. We know exactly where it is

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.430
from the hash table. With the dictionary, the built in in-operation

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.350
gives us that. So instead of looping, now we can check right

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.440
away if the keyword is in the index. So what's going to

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.810
happen if we found the keyword in the index, that means that

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.540
we can look it up. This will look up in the dictionary

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.010
the entry that corresponds to the index. That's going to be the list

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.670
of URLs that we have. And so all we need to do now is append to that entry the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.840
new URL. If it's not in the index already, well

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.590
we need to do something different. What we did before

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.870
was we added a new element to the index list

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.200
using append. We don't want to do that now. We

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.760
want to add a new key value paired to the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.560
dictionary. So we're going to do that by using the assignment.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.300
And the entry that we're adding is the list containing

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.110
just this URL. So you can delete everything else here.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.880
Add the new entry to the keyword. So this is a

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.220
lot simpler. We have less code. And it's going to run a lot

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.610
faster. We don't have to loop through anything. Because of the hash

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.240
table, we can right away look up whether the keyword is in

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.530
the index, we can find if it is, what the value

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.290
is, by using the dictionary lookup, and we can append the newer

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.490
URL to the list of the URLs associated with that keyword. If

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.320
it's not found, we can create a new entry, using the dictionary

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.910
syntax, like this, that contains just that URL. So,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.070
now we've got a much simpler way to add

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.620
to index. I hope you understand this. If you

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.910
do, you should be able to define lookup yourself.
