00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So clearly in our example,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
whether or not you're in a hospital

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
correlated with whether or not you died,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but the truth is, the example omitted

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and important variable,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the sickness, the disease itself.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And in fact, the sickness did cause you to die,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and also effected your decision of whether you go to a hospital or not.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So if you draw acts of causation,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you find sickness causes death,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and sickness causes you to go to the hospital,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and if anything at all,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
once you knew you were sick,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
being in the hospital negatively correlated

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
with you dying;

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that is, being in a hospital made it less likely

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
for you to pass away

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
given that you were sick.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In statistics, we call this a confounding variable.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's very tempting to just omit this from your data,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and if you do, you might find correlations;

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in this case, a positive correlation between the hospital and death,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that have nothing to do with the way things are being caused,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and as a result, those correlations don't relate at all

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to what you should do.

00:01:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So let's study another example.
