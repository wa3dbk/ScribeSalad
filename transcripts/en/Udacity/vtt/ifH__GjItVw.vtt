00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.790
Dynamic policies are policies who's forwarding behavior can

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.980
change. They are represented as a time series

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.870
of static policies. The current value of the

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.520
policy at any time is self dot policy. A

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.190
common programming idiom in Pyretic is to set

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.940
a default policy, and then register a call

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.510
back that updates that policy. In the assignment,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.530
you will create a similar topology that you created

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.630
in the pox assignment, but we will now

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.330
use pyretic to implement a simple switch and firewall.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.300
In pyretic every first packet with a new

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.160
source mac address, at the switch is read by

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.230
a query. The policy is updated with a

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.440
new predicate, everytime a new mapping between a MAC

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.740
address and an output port is learnt. In

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.640
the assignment you also create a dynamic firewall policy,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.050
register a callback to check the rules

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.920
and sequentially compose your firewall policy with

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.110
a learning switch, thus provided as part

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.470
of the pyritic distribution. In summary, pyretic allows

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.120
operators to write complex network policies as

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.690
functions. It allows an operator to express predicates

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.940
on packets, including things such as and,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.340
or, and not. It provides the capability to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.300
specify and modify virtual packet headers as packet metadata and it

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.252
provides ways to compose complex network policies from simpler independent ones.
