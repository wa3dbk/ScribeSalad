00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.730
The last relationship I want to cover, is that of proportions or comparisons.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.920
If you have multiple categories and want to show how the magnitude of

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.420
each compares to every other, you can use a stacked or unstacked bar chart.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.350
These bar charts, however, can also be used to show how

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.070
a distribution changes over time between the categories.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.050
If you remember from the previous video, much into our charts in this case what

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.890
the author labels as a column chart can be used to represent a distribution.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.010
And if we simply put every column of our bar chart side by side and

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.990
visualize how it changes, we can compare each of the categories.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.210
And last but not least, we get to deal with some food.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.360
Pie charts and donut charts convey proportions of a whole.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.790
I tend to shy away from pie charts because they can be visually misleading and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.730
rather use a stacked bar or

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.940
simply a table to represent the proportions of the whole.
