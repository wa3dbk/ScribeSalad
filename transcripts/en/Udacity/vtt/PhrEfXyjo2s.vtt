00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.888
We can find these points by looking at the curve of the function above the line

00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:08.972
y equals 0. And look at this, the boundaries of those intervals are here at x

00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:14.674
equals 3 halves, where the graph is intersecting y equals 0. And here at the

00:00:14.674 --> 00:00:19.445
vertical asymptotes of x equals 5, those were our critical values. All the x

00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:22.910
coordinates of this part of the function and all of the x coordinates of this

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.219
part of the function will satisfy our inequality. Awesome.
