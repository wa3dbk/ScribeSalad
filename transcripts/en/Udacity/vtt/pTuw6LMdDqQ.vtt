Before we talk about our results. If we did find that the experimental group,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.580
the one that got caffeine had significantly faster reaction times than the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.280
control group. The ones without caffeine. What conclusion can we draw, caffeine

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.070
causes faster reaction time, caffeine is correlated with reaction times? But we

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.310
cannot make a causal statement about this relationship. There is no

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.660
relationship. Select which one you think is best.
