00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.370
A hash function can be applied
to a block of data of any size.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.440
A hash function produces
an output of fixed size.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.556
Typically in the range
of 128 bits to 512 bits.

00:00:11.556 --> 00:00:18.100
It should be very efficient
to compute a hash of a input.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.850
For given hash value it should
be computationally infeasible

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.290
to find the input so that the hash
matches the given hash value.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.259
That is a hash function
should be a one way function.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.380
Given the input data say m1,
it should be computationally infeasible

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.510
to find another input value,
say m2 that is not equal to m1.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.380
Such that they have the same hash value.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.031
This is the weak collision
resistant property.

00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:54.560
The strong collision resistant
property is such that it should be

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.310
computationally infeasible
to five different inputs,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.910
m1 not equal to m2 such that
they have the same hash value.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.620
The first three properties make
hash functions practical for

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.100
security applications.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.160
In particular,
it can handle data of any size, and

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.390
it's very efficient to compute hash.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.960
The one way property says that it's
quite easy to compute a hash value

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.570
given a message, but
it is virtually impossible to find or

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.940
generate input message.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.200
Given a hash value.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.130
This property is very important for
message authentication.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.530
For example,
we can authenticate a message by hashing

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.720
a secret value together
with the message.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.760
The secret is not sent,
the hash and the message is sent.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.920
If the hash function is not one-way,
then the attacker

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.710
being able to intercept the hash
value that's being transmitted.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.140
He can then find an input
that computes the hash value.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.940
And the input would
include the secret value,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.550
that is the attacker would be
able to obtain the secret value.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.280
Therefore, this one way property
is extremely important.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.340
The weak collision resistant
property says that for

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.670
given message, it is not possible
to find a different message,

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.470
such that it will have the same
hash value as the given message.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.350
This is a very important property
to ensure message integrity.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.730
Now let's take a closer look at this
weak collision resistant property.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.730
Suppose when a sender sends
a message to the receiver,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.500
he wants to ensure
the integrity of the message.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.250
So the sender sends a message along with
an encrypted hash code of the message.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.690
Now an attacker can
intercept the message, and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.920
the encrypted hash code
that is being transmitted.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.570
Given a message, the attacker
can also compute the hash code.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.090
Of course this hash
code is not encrypted,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.320
because the attacker
does not have the key.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.140
Then if the weak collision
resistant poverty is not true.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.940
The attacker will be able
to find another message,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.130
such that each hash value is the same as
the hash value of the original message.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.500
Then the hacker simply forwards to
the receiver the forged message,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.050
along with the original
encrypted hash code.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.110
The receiver will not be able
to tell that the message

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.050
has been modified by the attacker.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.140
Because the forged message has
exactly the same hash value

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.560
as the original message.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.940
The strong collision resistant property,
says that it is not possible to find

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.980
any pair of two different messages, so
that they have the same hash value.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.390
It should be obvious that the strong
collision resistant property

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.350
implies the weak collision
resistant property.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.150
The weak collision resistant property
means that the hash function

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.810
is collision resistant.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.685
Only to the specific
given input messages.

00:03:34.685 --> 00:03:39.650
Whereas the strong collision resistant
property, means that the hash function

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.450
is collision resistant to any
pair of different messages.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.980
Therefore, this is stronger property and
it implies the weaker property.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.130
The strong collision resistant property,
provides strong message authenticity and

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.800
integrity protection.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.680
Let's take a look at an example.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.520
Suppose Bob did some work for Alice,
and he wants Alice to pay him later.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.210
So he can draft a IOU message and

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.320
ask Alice to sign and
then agree to pay for it.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.160
To sign the message,
Alice will hash the IOU message.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.270
And then sign the hash
using her private key.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.649
This will prove that Alice
authorized the IOU message.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.350
In other words, Alice would
agree to pay this amount later.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.470
In a later day, Bob can present this
IOU message, along with the signature,

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.870
to Alice or
Alice's bank to get the money.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.670
Now suppose the strong collision
resistant property is not true.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.800
That would mean that Bob can
find two different messages,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.010
one with a smaller dollar amount.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.030
For example,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.220
this small amount can be just one
installment of Alice's payment to Bob.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.780
And the larger amount would be
several times the amount of money

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.770
that Alice owes Bob.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.750
And if these two messages have the same
hash value, then Bob can present

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.520
the message with a small amount
to Alice, and have Alice sign it.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.690
Bob can present a signature
with a different message.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.750
That is, the message with a larger
amount, and ask Alice to pay for it.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.680
And because these two different
messages have the same hash value,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.670
Alice can not deny
that she has signed it.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.350
That means that Alice can not deny that

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.640
she has agreed to pay
this larger amount.
