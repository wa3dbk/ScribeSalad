00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:01.950
Images.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.940
What would the Internet be without them?

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.950
Just wait another 100 years, and
people will talk about the age of cat

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.730
images when discussing
art of the 21st century.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.355
And animated gifs will be
the quintessence of historic

00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:13.415
presentations of the web.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:17.335
In all honesty, though,
images don't just spice up the web,

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:19.725
they also make websites freaking huge.

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:24.145
In fact, the HTTP archive found that
63% of an average website's bytes

00:00:24.145 --> 00:00:24.805
are images.
