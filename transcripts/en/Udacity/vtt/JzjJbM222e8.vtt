00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.910
In this lesson we explained what is
virtualization, and what are some of

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.240
the main approaches that are used
to virtualize physical platforms.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.980
We specifically described mechanisms for
processor and memory, or

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.670
device virtualization that either were
or still are part of the dominant

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.440
virtualization solutions, such as
Zen and KVM or the VM Ware products.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.420
In addition, we discussed some of
the hardware advances that have occurred

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.690
as a result of the need to efficiently
virtualize the popular x86 platform.
