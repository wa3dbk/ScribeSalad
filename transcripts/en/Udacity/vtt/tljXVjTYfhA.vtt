00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.260
The answer is that
the first two are in NP.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.890
Graph connectivity can be solved in
polynomial time via depth-first search,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.830
no certificate necessary.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.600
This problem is in P, so
it's definitely in NP.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.760
Does a graph have a set of k
vertices with no edges between?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.690
Well, given the right k vertices,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.800
we can verify this by checking
order k squared edges in the graph.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.840
The certificate just needs
to give us this information.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.100
This last problem is not decidable,
as we've seen before, and

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.750
hence it simply can't be in NP.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.120
Note that there are decidable
questions that are not in NP too.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.480
The easiest one to articulate,
given what we've covered so

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.850
far, is deciding if a non-deterministic
Turing machine will halt after k steps,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.190
where k is encoded in binary.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.370
Unfortunately, the proof is
beyond the scope of this course.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.230
But it's worth knowing
that such problems exist.
