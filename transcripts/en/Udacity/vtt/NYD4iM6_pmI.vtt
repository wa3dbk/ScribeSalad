The number of dimes to the number of quarters is 2 to 3. So, if I reverse that

00:00:04.207 --> 00:00:08.601
ratio, the number of quarters to the number of dimes must be 3 to 2. I can write

00:00:08.613 --> 00:00:12.771
that with words, with a colon, or as a fraction. The second one was really

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:17.226
tricky. I don't know the total number of dimes and I don't know the total number

00:00:17.238 --> 00:00:21.497
of coins So, what can I do? Well, let's try some cases. If I started out with

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.068
two dimes, I'd have to have 3 quarters, which would be 5 coins in total. But I

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.648
didn't necessarily have to start with 2 dimes. What if I started with 4 dimes? I

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.672
doubled the number of dimes that I started with. So, I also need to double my

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:39.491
number of quarters. So, 4 dimes would have 6 quarters, which would be 10 coins

00:00:39.503 --> 00:00:43.959
in total. Notice that 2 divides into 4 and 10. 2 is the common factor, so I can

00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:48.441
simplify this fraction. And even if I had 6 dimes, I would have to have 9

00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:52.782
quarters, or 15 coins in total. And this fraction still reduces to 2 5ths. I

00:00:52.871 --> 00:00:57.675
removed a 3 as the common factor. That's pretty incredible. I didn't even know

00:00:57.687 --> 00:01:02.093
the total number of coins, or the total number of dimes, but I knew the ratio.

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:06.402
It was 2 to 5. If you didn't get the second part of the problem right, that's

00:01:06.414 --> 00:01:09.128
okay. I just wanted to get you thinking about ratios.
