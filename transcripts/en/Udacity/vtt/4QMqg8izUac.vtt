00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.840
This type of statistical analysis is prone to misinterpretation. As we

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.470
discussed in the last solution video, it's possible that those who were able to

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.935
view the musical lesson happened to be more engaged students already and we

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:18.140
wrongly attributed the high mean engagement score to the song. Of course it's

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.838
unlikely we found the probability of getting that sample mean engagement score

00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:27.374
was about 0.007, but it's still possible to have randomly obtained a sample

00:00:27.374 --> 00:00:33.622
with that mean. But this means that one of four things can happen, here's a

00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:37.846
diagram that's no completely filled out, but it shows the four possible things

00:00:37.846 --> 00:00:43.676
that can happen. The columns represent the decision we made, we either rejected

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:49.264
the null or retained the null, based on, the results of our sample. The state

00:00:49.264 --> 00:00:53.930
of the world is, what is actually happening. And we don't know what it is.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.987
We're just making a guess. Either the null is true, that there is not any

00:00:57.987 --> 00:01:02.786
significant effect from the treatment, or the null is false. There is a

00:01:02.786 --> 00:01:08.422
significant effect. Each of these four boxes represents a different situation.

00:01:08.422 --> 00:01:13.578
The truth, and then the decision we made. In two of these four cases, we made

00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:17.604
the correct statistical decision, but in the other two, we made the wrong

00:01:17.604 --> 00:01:22.670
decision. Check the two cases in which we've made the wrong statistical

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.883
decision.
