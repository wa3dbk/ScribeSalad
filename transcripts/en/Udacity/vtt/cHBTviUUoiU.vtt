00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now that we have an understanding of symmetric ciphers,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and we know how to generate a random key,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we're going to talk about an application, which is to store a file securely.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And our goal here is that we have--this is the computer--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
it may look more like a stapler, but it is intended to be a computer.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And we have on that computer, we have some file--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
what we'd like to do is store that data on the computer,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
know that if we leave the computer in a coffee shop and someone

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
captures the computer, they won't be able to read the contents in that file

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
this is to prevent the kind of incident one hears about fairly

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
frequently in the news, where someone has a list of Social Security Numbers for everyone

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
at the DMV, at the drivers' licensing office, and they leave that on their laptop

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and it gets stolen and then you've got a big worry about all that personal information

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
being lost. Probably that kind of file shouldn't be stored on someone's laptop

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
in the first place, but our goal is to be able to store files that contain sensitive information

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and know that even if the computer that they're stored on is stolen,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the contents of the file will still be secure.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Now we don't want to just throw the file away, we want the owner of the file

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to still be able to read the file.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And so we're going to assume that there's some key that the owner

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
of the file can store in some other place that's secure.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We'll talk a little bit later--how we might want to do that.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But let's assume there's a key that can be used to decrypt the file.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So here's the straightforward way to do this: we're going to take our file--

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we'll call it m--and we'll divide it into blocks

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and the block size will depend on the cipher we're using.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Let's assume we're using a cipher with 128-bit block size,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which is the size that AES uses.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Then what we'll store is the ciphertext, and each ciphertext block

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is the result of encrypting using the key k, the corresponding message block.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So how well does this work? Let's try a quiz.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So the question is: Assuming that E has perfect secrecy--

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
we know this is not true, because we're reusing the key

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
to encrypt multiple messages and Claude Shannon showed

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that this would only be possible in the case where

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the number of possible keys must exceed, or be equal to,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the number of possible messages. And that's not the case here.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
But let's assume that for now.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
What can an attacker learn if they capture the laptop and acquire C?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Check all the choices that are true--the choices are: nothing, the length of m,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the value of k, which blocks in m are equal.
