00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.760
Now you get a chance to practice
doing your reductions on your own.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.700
I have been using a python-like
syntax in these examples, so

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.860
they shouldn't feel terribly different.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.880
I want you to reduce the language,
which I'll call loop,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.110
which consists of descriptions of
machines that loop on the empty string.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.280
And we want to reduce that to
the language L, which consists of Turing

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.300
machines that do not accept
the number 34 written out in binary.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.770
As we'll see in a later lesson,
it's not possible for

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.620
me to perfectly verify your software.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.070
But, if you do
a straightforward reduction,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.730
then you should pass the test provided.
