00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.450
Now that we have seen what
a relational database looks like,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.530
we said it's a collection
of relations or tables, and

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.310
we looked at a table, and tuples, and
at the various attributes and so on.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.610
So, what kind of operations
can you perform on tables?

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.890
Of course you can create a table.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.420
We're talking about selecting certain
information out of a table of relations.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.106
So for example, I can say everybody
who is in a certain department,

00:00:27.106 --> 00:00:29.903
we can read that information
out of that relation.

00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:32.944
That's what a query selection will do,
and

00:00:32.944 --> 00:00:35.911
we going to see examples
of that will return.

00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:40.098
So you can select information, you
can of course insert tuples, or rows,

00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:43.090
you can update attribute
values that are in there.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.150
You can actually perform joint
operations across multiple tables and,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.410
of course, you can delete tuples,
delete tables and

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.890
eventually delete a database,
that may be a collection of tables.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.010
You know, create, delete are sort of
similar to what we have seen before, for

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.210
example, files.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.850
But some of the things like select,
insert, join, these are kind of

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.880
new to how you can manipulate and access
data that is stored in a data base.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.990
What I do for,
we said we write queries or

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.980
programs to access data that is stored
in a data base and those programs or

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.580
queries can actually make use of these
operations that we're talking about.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.570
So this is saying select, star means
everything, so all attribute values.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.150
&gt;From the employee table that we
had where the department ID is 15.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.320
So we are saying basically tell us,
give us the information about

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.100
every employee who works in
department that has ID 15.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.370
So this is an example of how
I might access information

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.180
that is told in the relation or
the table that we just saw.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.990
And this is an example of a read query,
because all we're doing is reading

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.210
selected pieces of information
that is there in that table.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.660
And returning that to whoever
is making this request.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.100
So actually if you are going to run this

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.970
query against the table
that we just saw.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.860
You'll see that the department ID is
15 for two employees, Robin and Cody.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.680
So we are going to get the tuples for
Robin and Cody.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.030
In response to, when we run this query
against the database that we have.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.710
So selection has happened because,
of course, we had a lot more employees.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.240
Now we're only selecting the ones who
work in the department with ID 15,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.680
who happen to be these two people.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.450
And these are return of the programs,

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.250
the queries that return in a language,
a query language.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.210
We talked about SQL before, and
we'll see some more examples of that.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.170
But basically these programs or
queries that we're talking about in

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.200
this language allow you to
use these basic operations.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.460
That you can perform on
tables of relations and

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.140
you can use these operations in
the programs that you write or

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.310
the queries that you submit to access
the data that is of interest to you.
