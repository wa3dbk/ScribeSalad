00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.790
Now that we're changing each of these 2 fractions, I want you to multiply these

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.702
numerators together and write your answer here. For the denominators, we don't

00:00:07.702 --> 00:00:11.275
want to multiply them out. We just want to list the factors. This is because

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:15.206
we're going to add the numerators in the end. We'll refactor that if possible

00:00:15.206 --> 00:00:20.290
and see if we can cancel any factors in the numerator and denominator of our

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.293
final answer.
