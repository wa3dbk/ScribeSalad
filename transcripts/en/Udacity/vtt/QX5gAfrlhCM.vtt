00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now we are in the position to write down differential equations.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We look at a single corner of that braking car.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Just a single wheel not all four wheels and just a quarter of the mass of that car.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's called the velocity of the car V and the velocity of the rim of the wheel W.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We specify the velocity of the wheel in m/s similar to how we specify the velocity of the car,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and which will show you or rather find a discussion that uses

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the angular velocity of the wheel and that uses the moment of inertia of the wheel,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which gets overly complex for all purposes.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This quarter of the car exerts a certain force on the ground, namely--

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
the mass of that quarter of the car times gravitational acceleration.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
By friction, the road surface exerts this force on the wheel.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If you wonder about the direction, imagine that the wheel was locked

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and friction will put it around in a clockwise fashion.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The first thing to be computing is the wheel slip s and given these two velocities,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the velocity of the car and the velocity of the rim of the wheel,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
we can compute the wheel slip by 1-W/V.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Let's do this. I need to check. If the wheel is lock, the velocity of its rim will be zero.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
W will become zero. What do we get? 1-0. A value of one fitting to the wheel being locked.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000
If we have a perfectly rolling motion, W will be equal to V and we compute 1-1/1 which is zero.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This seems to be very plausible.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Once we've got the wheel slip, we can compute the force from friction

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and it's the coefficient of friction which again depends on the wheel slip times the force

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
perpendicular to that surface, 1/4 the mass of the car times gravitational acceleration

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and now it's time to look at the velocities.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The car is decelerated. The rate of change of the velocity of the car minus the friction force

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
divided by the mass of that 1/4 of the car.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Think about Newton's law--F=m*a. The rate of change of the velocity is the acceleration.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This our force, this is our mass, and we have to take care of that we are braking decelerating.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We get a similar equation for the velocity of the rim of the wheel.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Its rate of change increases through a friction, so we've got a plus sign now.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The mass to be used here is not the mass of this 1/4 of the car.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It's rather something like the effective mass of the rear.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
In reality, we would have to take care of the circumstance that the mass of the wheel is

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
distributed over the cylinder.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
To make things simple, I'm using an effective mass here. That's my own term.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
As I said before, the typical way of dealing with this would be using angular velocities

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
with moments of inertia, which considerably complex.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Let's cheat a little and introduce this effective mass of the wheel here.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
If the mass of the wheel was concentrated at its circumference,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
then this would actually be the mass of the wheel.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This is not all. We have to model the action of the brake which acts on the rear.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
The break decelerates the wheel. Let me put it like that minus capital B

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and this quantity B represents the strength of that braking process.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If you put it like this, it acts like a deceleration of the wheel so it's something measured in m/s².

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
If it wasn't for the friction force, the wheel would be decelerated by this amount.

00:03:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Now we have reached four equations that describes the process of braking.
