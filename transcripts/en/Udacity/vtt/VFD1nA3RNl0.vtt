00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.638
For the coefficients, we just divide them. We know 8 divided by 2 makes 4. For

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:09.158
the bases of x, however, we want to subtract their exponents. We have 7 minus

00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:13.730
positive 1, which is 6. Another way to think about it is we would have x to the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.312
6th left in the numerator. So 4x to the 6th is our first term. 6x to the 4th

00:00:18.312 --> 00:00:23.867
would be our second term. 12 divded by 2 makes 6. And x to the 5th divided by x

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:28.624
to the 1 makes x to the 4th. Our last term should be negative 3x squared. 6

00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:33.331
divided by 2 equals negative 3. We know it's negative because the sign is

00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:38.790
negative. And then x to the 3rd divided by x to the 1 is x squared, or x to the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.915
2nd. Here's the answer to dividing this polynomial. Great work if you got it

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:45.510
right.
