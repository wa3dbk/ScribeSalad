00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And yes, you'll steer in proportion to the crosstrack error,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which means the larger the error, the more you're willing to turn towards the target trajectory.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You can see that this works. As you get closer to trajectory, your steering will be slower and slower.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You will reach the trajectory.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Clearly the other two answers are really bad.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
A constant steering will put you in a circle and not in a straight line.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Random steering, if you ever implement this, is a really bad idea.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Believe me. We accidentally did this once.

00:00:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
It's a really bad idea.
