00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.800
Now let's go back to our editor and turn

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.640
this into a mini shopping list application. Okay we're going to

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.360
add a bunch of code here that I'll walk

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.580
you through as I go. Okay first thing I'm going to

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.000
do is replace this input type hidden line with

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.970
a percent s and if you recall percent s is

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.750
the. Python string formatting character I'm going to give you

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.750
a quick example of that. I'm in Python real quick,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.409
if we have a string you know, hello percent S. And I say percent Steve

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:37.740
it substitutes the string following the percent sign in to the percent S in the

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.098
string. So if I were to say greeting, equals hello percent S, and I can

00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:48.733
say greeting [UNKNOWN] it substitutes that string

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.873
in. So, anyway just kind of basic Python,

00:00:50.873 --> 00:00:53.577
but I just wanted to make sure you understand it, because I'm

00:00:53.577 --> 00:00:56.884
going to abuse it in this lesson. Okay, so a replaces input with percent

00:00:56.884 --> 00:00:59.677
S, and I'm going to add a couple more templates here and then

00:00:59.677 --> 00:01:03.166
explain things as I go. Okay, and now I'm going to add a couple

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:07.312
more strings, HTML strings and I'll explain them as I go. What

00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:08.984
I'm trying to do here is trying to make a big mess here

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:11.505
for you that we will clean up using templates later. Okay, again

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:15.885
I'm making, I'm using another triple coded string so I can enter HTML

00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:18.732
[SOUND] I'm going to make my input type equals

00:01:18.732 --> 00:01:23.622
hidden. Name equals food again. And value equals

00:01:23.622 --> 00:01:25.700
percent S, because I'm going to substitute more values

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.200
in here. Then I'm going to make one final string

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.560
that will represent a shopping list. A couple

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.370
blank lines, a little title, and then an unordered

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.160
list. Remember the UL tag makes an unordered

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.900
list. I'm going to use percent S to represent our

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.200
content inside there. And them I'm going to close my

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.350
unordered list tag. Now you'll notice I'm not really

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.750
indenting things or not getting any nice syntax highlighting.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.910
That's because I'm editing strings in Python. It's not an

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.890
ideal way to go but, it's what we're doing

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.690
for now. Okay, now let's update our main page handler

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.840
to do more than just print out the form

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.640
HTML. What? Actually, let's take a look at what happens

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.788
if, if I just print out this HTML as it is.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.540
"Kay, we're back in our browser, and I've rerouted the page, and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.770
now you can see there's this big ugly percent S in

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.870
the middle of our form. And remember, this is in the HTML,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.310
this is where our hidden element used to be. If I

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.550
were to look at the source of this page, you can see

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.690
it right here in the browser that ugly percent S. So,

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.890
anyway, let's go back to updating our code. First thing, I am

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.260
going to do is build up a string called output. It's going to be,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.190
it's going to start off as our form HTML and this is what

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.990
we are going to return to the user. So, go ahead and, and

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.930
update this to return output. Okay, and now remember our, form HTML has

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.150
a percent S variable in it so I'm going to make a holding

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.420
place for the value I'm going to in there, and I'm going to call

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.630
that hidden HTML, and that will refer to that'll hold the content

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.380
that we're going to sub into there, that'll be where our hidden inputs go.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.540
'Kay, now this line here gets all of

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.030
the get parameters, or post parameters for that

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.400
matter, called food. get_all basically means in, in

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.300
App Engine, basically says, if there are multiple parameters

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.070
with the same name, get all of them, and put them in a list. So items

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.474
will be a list of all the food parameters that are in the URL. 'Kay, now we're

00:03:22.474 --> 00:03:26.020
going to loop overall each of those items. So, the first

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.050
thing we're going to do is we're going to add our hidden

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.230
HTML line. Okay, and actually I have a little bug

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.196
here. I am going to replace, I going to rename hidden HTML to

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:38.610
be output hidden. I'm going to prefix all of my strings

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.220
that are holding output HTML with the word output. And because

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.610
I originally called that hidden HTML but we're already using

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.550
that up here to refer to this little HTML string for

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.860
hidden input. So, for each item in items

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.990
add to the string hidden HTML substituting the

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.120
food name. So basically output hidden will be

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.770
a bunch of input type hiddens where the value

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.490
is the food from the URL. Okay, I'm

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.220
going to add another [UNKNOWN] here we'll call output

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.365
items, [SOUND] and also for each item and

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:12.500
items, we're going to append another little bit of HTML.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.530
And you can see actually I didn't create item HTML,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.279
let's add that real quick up here after our hidden

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.050
HTML. And this will be a list item that goes

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.662
inside the shopping list HTML. So we're going to create up,

00:04:25.662 --> 00:04:27.380
add up a bunch of those. So we've got output_hidden

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.860
which will be a bunch of hidden inputs and output_items

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.240
will be a bunch of list elements. Okay, now we're

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.280
going to use our shopping list HTML equals shopping list HTML substituting

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.300
in our items and then our output. And then to

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.090
the end of our output we're going to add our shopping

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.631
list. And we will only want to add things for

00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:54.110
our shopping list if they were actual items in the response.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.298
So if the response is empty, none of this is

00:04:55.298 --> 00:04:58.740
going to work. So let's make sure we do this properly. So

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.290
I indented everything. As you can tell, this is getting

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.560
somewhat hard to read. That's kind of the point. And finally

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.740
we're going to take our overall output and substitute in the, the hidden

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.600
string that we've been building up here. Now, when of all this is

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.770
said and done, this is going to give us a basic shopping list

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.500
functionality. Which I'll demo now, and then we'll walk through the actual code.
