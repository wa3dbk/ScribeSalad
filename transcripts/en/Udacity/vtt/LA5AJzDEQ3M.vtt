00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.880
As it turns out, the internets design

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.020
is actually fundamentally insecure. Many explicit design choices

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.310
have caused the internet to be vulnerable

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.870
to different types of attacks. The internet was

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.770
designed for simplicity, and as a result

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.020
security was not a primary consideration when the

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.380
internet was originally designed. Another aspect of the

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.340
internet's design is that it's on by default.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.170
In other words, when a host is connected

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.460
to the internet, it is by default reachable by

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.570
any other host that has a public IP address.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.600
This means that if one has an insecure host,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.800
that host is effectively wide open to attack by

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.380
other hosts on the internet. Now, this wasn't a

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.470
primary design consideration when the internet consisted of a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.540
small number of trusted networks, but as the internet

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.950
has continued to grow, this on by default design,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.940
or the notion that any host should always be

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.460
reachable by any other host has come under fire.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.160
Part of the reason that their on by default model

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.070
does not work that well is that hosts are

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.990
insecure. This makes it possible for a remote attacker to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.400
compromise a machine that's connected to the internet. And

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.850
commandeer it for the purposes of attack. In many cases,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.100
an attack might actually just look like normal

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.720
traffic. For example, in the case of an attack

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.600
on a victim web server, every individual request

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.300
to that web server might look normal, but the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.660
collection of requests together, mounted as part of

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.260
a, distributed denial of service attack. Might add up

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.790
to a volume of traffic that the server

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.600
is unable to handle. Finally, the internet's federated design,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.270
obstructs cooperation for diagnosis or mitigation. In other words because the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.190
internet is run by tens of thousands of independently run networks, it can be

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.600
very difficult to coordinate a defense against an attack because each of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.470
these networks is run by different

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.310
network operators, sometimes in completely different countries
