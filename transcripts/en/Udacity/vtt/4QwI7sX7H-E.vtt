00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.485
So in our last section, we talked a little about culture, language, and

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:06.975
thought. And now, we're going to jump to focusing on thought in more detail.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:10.147
First we're going to begin by looking at thinking, reasoning, and decision

00:00:10.147 --> 00:00:14.648
making, but there's a couple words you should know before we start. So, here,

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:18.400
we have "cognition". "Cognition" is the mental processes involved in acquiring,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.310
processing, and storing knowledge. If you remember from lesson one, we talked

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.065
about cognitive psychology. Which is the study of how people perceive,

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:31.060
remember, think, and solve problems. When you're at home on the couch relaxing,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.876
thinking about a vacation you want to take, or of the great movies you saw last

00:00:33.876 --> 00:00:38.700
week, or even thinking about a new way to solve problems you may encounter.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.908
What's happening? How are you able to do that? Did you ever stop to wonder

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:44.858
about what was going in in the brain? That is, how do we use our brains to

00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:49.840
solve and maintain these mental processes? So thinking is our cognition.
