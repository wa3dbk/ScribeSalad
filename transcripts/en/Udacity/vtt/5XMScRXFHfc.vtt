00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let's start out again with an example here. And by example, of course,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I mean a quiz. Actually I mean a triple quiz, because I have 3 questions for you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The first one is the size of a minimum vertex cover for this graph here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The second one is the size of the greedy solution. And then finally the size of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the solution that would have been produced if we had used the Take 2 algorithm.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So please give me your 3 answers here.
