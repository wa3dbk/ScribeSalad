00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.407
So now that I can create a complex composition of parallel nested with parallelism,

00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:08.311
taking in my audio stream, putting it through a sequence of operations,

00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:10.686
coming out with a re-normalized stream like this,

00:00:10.686 --> 00:00:13.935
it opens the door to something called task parallelism.

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:18.154
Now, task parallelism is where you run multiple independent tasks,

00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:21.514
more or less like separate programs each working on their own data.

00:00:21.514 --> 00:00:25.659
So you've probably noticed that the nested problem that we looked at before,

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:31.368
the volume normalizer, could be launched from the CPU, but the GPU's really good at running lots of things at once,

00:00:31.368 --> 00:00:33.903
so we can take our volume normalization algorithm,

00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:37.281
and we can run it on dozens of audio streams all at the same time.

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:42.482
We've got one program with multiple instances handling multiple audio streams

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:47.422
all at the same time on a single GPU without any complicated CPU to GPU communication.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:52.820
This is task parallelism, and this is one way to get a lot of power out of the GPU all at once.
