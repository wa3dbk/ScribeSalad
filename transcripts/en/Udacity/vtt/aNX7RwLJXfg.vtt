Do you remember this question that Greg asked? Well, the answer is, during your

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:08.250
teenage years, this is another time when your amount of REM sleep increases.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.850
So, does the amount of neural growth. The human brain is still growing into

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.538
early adulthood. Neurons though, never stop growing, even if the rate of growth

00:00:16.538 --> 00:00:21.240
does slow over time. The biggest region of brain growth in adolescents occurs

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.459
in the frontal lobes. Which allow us to think abstractly, plan, control

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:30.230
impulses and to think critically, and scientifically. Teenagers are much more

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.332
likely to do impulsive and risky things, because their frontal lobes are still

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:37.606
growing and maturing. Driving a car really, really fast while not wearing a

00:00:37.606 --> 00:00:41.008
seatbelt, or skateboarding off of a 5-foot stair handrail seems perfectly

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:45.526
reasonable to many teenagers. The brain isn't our only change during

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:48.484
adolescence though. Let's go check in with Susan, who's going to explain the

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:50.670
other physical changes that we go through.
