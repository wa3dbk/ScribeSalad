00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.953
But what if we wanted to add these 2 fractions together? What do you think we

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:08.189
could do? Well, adding these 2 rational expressions together is very similar to

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.976
adding 2 fractions together. If the denominators are different, we need to

00:00:11.976 --> 00:00:16.344
change each fraction. By finding the lowest common denominator first. We know

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:20.434
the lowest common denominator would be 90, the product of these factors. We

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:25.501
multiply 1 10th by nine over nine, which is the missing factor from ten. 1 10th

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:31.798
by 9 9ths is 9 90ths. For 1 18th we multiply by five over five. This is the

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:37.968
missing factor for 18. So 1 18th time 5 5ths is 5 90ths. Now we add these 2

00:00:37.968 --> 00:00:44.229
fractions just as we learned before. 9 plus 5 equals 14 and we have 14 90ths.

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.789
These numbers are both even and so we can reduce them by 2. So these are a

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.223
couple of fractions.
