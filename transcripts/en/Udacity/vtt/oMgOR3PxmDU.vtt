00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.961
With our simplified pipeline, the application sends down triangles to be

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:08.080
transformed to, to screen locations and then filled in. What happens if two

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.276
triangles overlap on the screen? How is it decided which one is visible? One way

00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:16.200
to render it is what is called the painter's algorithm. The idea is to draw each

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.480
object one on top of the other. To make this work, you sort objects based on

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.835
their distance from the camera back to front. You then render the most distant

00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:29.894
object first. Render the next closest object. Render the next closest object

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:33.860
than that and so on. The closest object is drawn last so it covers up the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.544
objects behind it. This isn't really how most painters actually paint but it

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:40.875
could work in theory for, say, oil paints. I guess it makes some sense for

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:44.363
computers to use it since it's a somewhat mindless way to paint a painting.
