00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.920
Let's use the random class to write a program that uses a loop to simulate

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:11.075
tossing a 6 sided die 100 times. The die can come up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Write

00:00:11.075 --> 00:00:15.204
your program so that it prints the number of sixes that come up. You'll need to

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:19.710
import java.util.Random to use a random generator. So then I can help you check

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.500
your work. We're going to do a bit of a magic trick. Random generators can be

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.875
seeded. What that means is you give them a number to start rolling from, and

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:32.046
then they grow a pattern based on that seed. So the sequence they generate will

00:00:32.046 --> 00:00:35.598
look random, but if you create another random generator like this, they'll both

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:41.002
generate the exact same sequence. So all you need to know about that for now,

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:45.118
is to declare your random generator this way. Because the grading code will be

00:00:45.118 --> 00:00:49.214
expecting a sequence of numbers generated with this seed. If you're not sure

00:00:49.214 --> 00:00:52.139
what I'm talking about, and you're curious, stick around for a moment and I'll

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:57.440
demo what this does. But feel free to skip to the quiz. My trusty code pad.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.536
I'll create and seed a random generator, and now I'll do the exact same thing,

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:08.410
and make another one. Now if I ask the first generator for an int, I'll get 2.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.020
And if I ask the other generator for exactly the same thing, I will also get 2.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.378
I can do this again, and they still both agree. So while I'm getting random

00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:20.368
numbers out of this, The numbers are predictable, so we know what to expect and

00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:22.670
can help you debug your code.
