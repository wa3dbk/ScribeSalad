00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.954
The growth that we're seeing here has a special name, exponential growth. And

00:00:04.954 --> 00:00:09.452
it's produced by what's called an exponential function. Here's the graph of an

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:14.147
exponential function with a slightly simpler equation. I'd like you to fill out

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:19.258
this x, f of x chart, so we can get an idea of what's going on here. I'll get

00:00:19.258 --> 00:00:24.027
it started for you with the coordinates of one point. On the graph lies the

00:00:24.027 --> 00:00:30.248
point negative 3, 1 8th. Now, please fill in the rest of the corresponding

00:00:30.248 --> 00:00:32.329
values of f of x.
