00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.380
Lastly, an adjacency matrix can be used.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.530
In computer science,
a matrix is essentially a 2D array, but

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.660
the lists inside are all
the same length.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.510
A matrix can also be called
a rectangular array.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.630
When you look at it,
it looks like a rectangle.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.900
The adjacency matrix is actually
really similar to the adjacency list.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.669
The indices in the outer array still
represent nodes with those IDs.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.110
And the list inside still represents
which nodes are adjacent.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.320
However, these inner lists represent
information in a slightly different way.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.900
Before, the list contained just
the IDs of adjacent nodes.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.726
Now the inner list has one slot for
every node in the array,

00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:50.920
where node IDs map to array indices.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.340
If there's an edge between these
two nodes, a 1 goes into the array.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.870
If there's no edge, a 0 is present.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.900
You might notice that the diagonal or
the place on every line where the row

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.100
number equals the column number,
is always 0.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.970
This value would only be 1 if
there is an edge that started and

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.600
ended with the same node.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.640
But we don't have any
of those in our graph.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.440
You should also note that a single
edge shows up twice in the matrix.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.780
For example, this edge shows
up when the row is 0, and

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.220
the column is 1, and also,
when the row is 1, and the column is 0.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.320
Which method of representation you use
depends on what makes the most sense for

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.539
you and what operations you'll
be performing the most often.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.890
If you're looking at node degree or
the number of edges connected to

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.860
a particular node, the adjacency
list will probably be the fastest.
