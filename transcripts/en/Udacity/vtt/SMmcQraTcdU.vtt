00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.224
Because all of our entities are simulated using physics bodies, we lack the

00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:07.160
ability to simply move our player to our desired position. This type of

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.332
teleportation can cause issues with your physics environment, mainly,

00:00:10.332 --> 00:00:13.972
teleported objects ignore physics calculations until after their teleportation

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:18.570
has been resolved. For instance, if we move the player to a teleported position

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.860
which is intersected at the wall we could potentially get stuck there. And then

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.868
confuse the PhysicsEngine on what to do next, since the player is, of course,

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:29.810
stuck. As such, rather than teleporting the player we need to update it's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.190
velocity such that the PhysicsEngine moves that unit to where we want it to go,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.599
next update loop. Now all of our players actually have an mpPhysBody variable.

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:42.383
This physics body is given to us on the instantiation of the player, by

00:00:42.383 --> 00:00:46.587
allocating it from the PhysicsEngine. Since we can't set the physics body

00:00:46.587 --> 00:00:50.085
position directly, due to teleportation issues, what we do instead is a little

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:54.478
bit of a workaround. We take advantage of the fact that the PhysicsEngine is

00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:58.900
going to update all of the physics bodies that it owns every frame. The physics

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.445
bodies themselves allow you to define a velocity vector on them. When the

00:01:03.445 --> 00:01:06.855
PhysicsEngine updates, it adjusts the position of the physics body by the

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:11.330
vector, moving it correctly. We, in GRITS can take advantage of this. By

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.230
supplying a velocity vector that will move our physics body to the position we

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.310
want it to be in. Avoiding the teleportation issues.
