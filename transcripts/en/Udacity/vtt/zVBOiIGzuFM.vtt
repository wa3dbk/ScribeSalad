00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.200
Now before we move on to the combined approach with Greg, let's do a quick

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.293
recap of the psychological therapies. Let's first start with psychodynamic

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:12.870
therapy. The goal of psychodynamic therapy is to uncover the repressed or

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.855
unconscious thoughts, feelings, and motives one has. The techniques of

00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:21.275
psychodynamic therapy are things like dream interpretation, and free

00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:26.576
association. Now let's move on to humanistic therapies. The goal of humanistic

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:32.322
therapy is to create conditions for optimal personal growth. The techniques for

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:37.360
humanistic therapy are unconditional positive regard, and empathic listening.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.244
The goal of behavioral therapy is to change reinforcers and rewards, to change

00:00:42.244 --> 00:00:47.754
maladaptive behavior. The techniques include classical and operate

00:00:47.754 --> 00:00:53.581
conditioning, token economies, and systematic desensitization. The goal of

00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:59.000
cognitive therapy is to change emotions or irrational thoughts. The technique

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.550
used in cognitive therapy is critical questioning, and challenge a person's

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.500
thoughts with logic. The goal of cognitive behavioral therapy is to change

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.700
behavior and thoughts. The technique used in cognitive behavioral therapy is to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.460
restructure thoughts, and use incentives for acquiring more adaptive thoughts

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.424
and behaviors. There's also the use of appraisal. The goal of group therapy is

00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:28.572
to create a support group in a community to show the person that he or she is

00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:34.374
not alone. The technique for group therapy is something like a support group or

00:01:34.374 --> 00:01:39.244
a 12-step program. Now that we've done a brief overview of the psychological

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:42.530
therapies, let's go on to Greg for our final section, which is the combined

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.369
approach.
