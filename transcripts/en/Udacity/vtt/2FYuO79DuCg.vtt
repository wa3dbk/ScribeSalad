00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.810
So when we reason inductively, we often make causal inferences. And a causal

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.505
inference is simply when we decide that one thing causes another. So for

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:13.767
example, when I go on a vacation, I always get sick. And implicit in this

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:17.788
statement, is a causal inference. And the causal inference is that vacations

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:22.890
causes me to get sick. Now, when we use inductive reasoning and causal

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.003
inferences, we sometimes fall prey to what's known as confirmation bias. And

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.601
confirmation bias is when we seek out information and pay attention to

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:36.628
information that confirms our already held beliefs, and we dismiss and ignore

00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:42.692
information that dis-confirms, or contradicts, our beliefs. So for example,

00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:45.878
when you're writing a paper, do you actually look for information that

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:50.424
dis-confirms and contradicts your thesis? Or do you write about and pay

00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:54.971
attention to only that information that confirms your ideas? Yeah, I thought

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:58.506
so. You know, many of us do this. But next time you're writing a paper, try

00:00:58.506 --> 00:01:04.477
this. Try to integrate, both confirming and disconfirming evidence. It'll make

00:01:04.477 --> 00:01:08.355
for a stronger paper. Which actually leads to our next topic, Critical

00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:09.487
Thinking.
