00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's talk about the solution to our problem with heat along the wire.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
First things first, I've rewritten the implicit equation that I gave you in the intro video.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The only change here that you'll see is how I've replaced the coefficient

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
in front of the parenthesis with C, the parameter that we created for you in the code.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, if we rearranged this equation a little bit, we can get it in the form that's super convenient

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
for using numpy.matalg.solve.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is because we already know T₈(0) and now we know what the coefficients are.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So we are to solve for all of the temperatures after times that of h.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This shows us then that two of the elements in the matrix coefficient

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
are going to be -C and 1+2C.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The one exception to this is going to occur at the boundaries.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I told you these were going to be a little bit tricky,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so let's talk about how to deal with them with right now.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We take this equation right here but instead plug in the correct values for T₀.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We see something interesting. There's a dependence on T₋₁.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now we defined our boundary with additions earlier, that T₋₁ is going to equal T₀ for any time.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Once we plugged this n, we're actually going to get a pretty simple equation

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
something that only depends on T₀ and T₁.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
To help you better visualize how are we going to fill in the array using loops,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I've created this diagram right here which color codes the different possible coefficients

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that we could have in any slot in the matrix.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
As you just saw, a bunch of the terms in the matrix are going to be 0,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
so I filled in big 0s for those portions of the matrix.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We know that the temperature of the second that we're looking at,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is going to have a coefficient of 1+2C in front of it corresponding to this blue spirals.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We know that both adjacent segments who have coefficients of -C

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which are these pink spirals over here.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The two exceptions of course occur at the boundaries,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
for we have one pink spiral and one green spiral.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
For one coefficient -C and then one coefficient of 1+C.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now if I felt like working really hard, I guess I could have drawn this diagram

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
with 100 rows and 100 columns making up the actual size of the matrix that we're looking at.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But I was feeling lazy so I scaled it down a bit.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
However, if we think about it, we know that the number of blue spirals

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
in that imaginary expanded diagram will be equal to 98 because there's going to be one blue spiral

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in every row with the exception of the first and last.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Similarly, we would see 198 pink spirals, two for every row,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
except only one in the top and bottom rows.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
In the picture I just showed you, the blue spirals corresponded to the coefficient 1+2C

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and we said that we would need a loop using 98 iterations to express that.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
That's exactly what we have here in this top for loop.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
You can see that the next for loop contains one more iteration, since it starts at the index 1 lower.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
As expected, this corresponds to the pink spirals in the diagram with the coefficient equals -C.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Here we have two exceptions for the two different boundaries

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and you remember that these were the green spirals in the diagram.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
We can check and see that we've set the step size equal to 0.5 seconds as we said we want to do.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
We can run the program and see what we get.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Sure enough, we end up with the same solution that I showed you earlier.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Since in our initial situation, we had a flame placed under the center of our wire,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
it makes sense that after some time has passed,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
we still see a peak in temperature toward the center of the wire,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but the distribution has smooth out quite a bit.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
This has right in line that what we expect from the heat equation.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Right now, the end time is set to 10 seconds which means that the final graph that we're looking at

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
is the distribution of the temperature at this time.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Let's see what happens if we set it to something smaller

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
showing what's happening earlier on in the temperature change.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So here's our distribution after just 4 seconds have passed.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Consider we have a nice smooth curve, a lot like what we saw earlier

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
except that this time the peak is at a much higher level than it was earlier.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
When end time was at the 10 seconds, the peak was just under 500 Kelvin

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and now we can see that it's resting right above 600.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
The distribution is also quite a bit narrower showing that we're farther away

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
from the equilibrium position than we were with the larger step.
