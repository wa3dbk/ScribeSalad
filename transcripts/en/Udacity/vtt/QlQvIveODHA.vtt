00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.295
Let's quickly check if we understood
the write-update optimizations.

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:09.760
Suppose that we have a system with two
cores that uses write-update coherence.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.310
Suppose that the two cores are executing
a program where core 0 writes something

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.320
to a memory address A, then core
1 reads it and this continues so

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.760
that the write and then a read pattern
repeats, for a total of 1,000 times.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.900
So this is the first of 1,000.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.200
After they do this for 1,000 times,
these cores go to do something else,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.330
where core 0 replaces A and
then core 1 also replaces A.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.490
The question for you is,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.050
how many bus uses do we see when
the system uses no optimizations?

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.840
So there is no dirty bit and
no shared bit.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.900
When the system uses only
the dirty bit optimization, and

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.790
when the system uses both the dirty and
the shared bit optimization.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.970
So for each of these,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.290
how many bus uses do we get during
this whole time for block A?

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.320
And also, how many memory writes do
we get in each of these three cases?
