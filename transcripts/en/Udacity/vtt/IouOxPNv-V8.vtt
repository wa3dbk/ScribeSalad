00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.160
Let's revisit our To-do list.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.500
At this point,
you should be able to run the app and

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.220
see a GIF with a caption added in
the preview of your controller.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.290
For example, here's my roommate's dog,
Mia, patiently waiting for a treat.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.530
Notice that I can make
a GIF from this video, and

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.520
then I can add a caption and
I can see the caption in the preview.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.900
Sweet, add a caption, done.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.910
We can check that one off.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.130
All right, moving on to share the GIF.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.009
Our share the gift task has fewer steps.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.360
We just need to add the GIF to
an activity items array, and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.480
then present options to share it
with an Activity View Controller.
