00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.320
Now that we have seen the Iron Law of Performance, let's do a quiz on the Iron

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.510
Law of Performance. Let's say we have a

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.790
program that has 3 billion instructions executing from start

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.075
to completion. Let's say that our processor spends

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:18.000
two cycles on each instruction, and the processor is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.322
clocked at three gigahertz. So we can say

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:23.190
that the execution time is: put your answer here.
