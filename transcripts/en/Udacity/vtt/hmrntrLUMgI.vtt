00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.150
Remember back, several lessons ago, when we analyzed a set of requirements for

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.190
a library information system, and we expressed the results in a UML class model

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.130
diagram. Along the way, we were actually able to improve the quality of

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.960
the requirements as we discovered several things,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.100
that weren't mentioned explicitly. But there were some aspects of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.040
the problem that the UML diagram could not express. In this lesson,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.100
we will use, the object constraint language, a part of UML, to fill in the gaps.
