00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.920
Suppose we have an analog audio signal that we'd like to digitize, or send

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.970
as a stream of bits. What we can do is sample the audio signal at fixed

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.280
intervals, and then represent the amplitude of

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.090
each sample with a fixed number of bits.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.490
For example, if our dynamic range was from

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.030
0 to 15, we could quantize the amplitude

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.610
of this signal such that each sample could be represented with four bits.
