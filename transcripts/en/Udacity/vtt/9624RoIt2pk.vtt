00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, let's make some changes to this file.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first thing we're going to do is we're going to get rid of this Google action

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and replace it with /testform, and now that's going to cause

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
our form when we submit it to submit to /testform instead of to Google.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And since our application can only respond to slash,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we're going to need to add a handler for that as well.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We'll come down here to our URL handler section,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and because we only have a handler for slash,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we're going to add another handler for /testform.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
/testform will be handled by the handler called TestHandler, which doesn't exist yet.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's create that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Okay, so we've added this new handler called TestHandler.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This also has a method on it called get, like our other handler,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and what this does is it sets a variable called q,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which comes from self.request.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Like response is the object that represents the response

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we're going to send back to the client, request represents the request

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that came from the browser, and you can call get on it to get different parameters,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so in this case we're going to get the parameter q.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And then all we're going to do is we're going to turn on the response

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
self.response.out.write(q).

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So if we go to our browser,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we enter some words, and we hit submit,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we see the string hello world!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You can see in the URL q = hello World! which is what we answered,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
so this is hitting the same URL we were hitting before,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but this time there's a web application on the other end

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
listening for requests and returning responses.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The exclamation mark turned into a %21.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That was the escaping I was referring to before.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Okay, now I'd like to make another change.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm going to comment out these 2 lines and show you something neat.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm going to take this content-type line from up here

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because we want to print some text, and we want it to work properly.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This time, instead of writing out q, I'm going to write out self-request itself.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Okay, let's go to our browser and try this out.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Here's our form.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You may have to go back to URL and reload. That's fine.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Type some text in the form and click submit.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
When you click submit, what just happened?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Did you see garbage?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Did you see the HTTP request?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Do you see a message from the future, or nothing happens at all?
