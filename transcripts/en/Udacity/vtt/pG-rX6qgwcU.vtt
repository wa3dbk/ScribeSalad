00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.104
Now that we have an inequality it'd be really, really great if we could help

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.328
Grant figure out how much he could add on to his booth and still stay under this

00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:12.375
area requirement of 750 square feet. So if we wanted to solve for x in this

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:16.369
inequality, what are we going to end up with? Is that going to give us one

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.695
solution? Two solutions or an interval of possible solutions. What kind of

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:24.849
answer do we get from a quadratic inequality?
