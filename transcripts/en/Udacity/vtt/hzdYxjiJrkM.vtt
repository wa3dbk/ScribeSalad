00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
JavaScript also has support for numbers,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and just like in Python they can be whole numbers.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
They can have decimal fractional parts,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
or they can be negative.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I like all of those, but all of these examples here in blue at the bottom,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
1.2.3.4, that has too many decimal points.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is not a number written using digits.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is not a number at all, although I may have its number.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That would totally work.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now that we have an intuition for what numbers look like in JavaScript,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
there's a quiz.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'd like you to define t_number that matches the examples in red

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but does not match the examples in blue,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but normally the value of a token is a string.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I want you to convert it to a float before returning.
