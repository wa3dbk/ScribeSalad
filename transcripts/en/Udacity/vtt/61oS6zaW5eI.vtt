00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.801
So, we've done a lot of work with cake. And, as much as I like cake, especially

00:00:03.812 --> 00:00:07.631
chocolate cake, let's see how else we can use our fractions. Even if I spend all

00:00:07.643 --> 00:00:11.461
that time baking, I probably want to go outside. So, let's see our fractions in

00:00:11.473 --> 00:00:13.311
another content. Walking.

00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:17.360
So here's our next problem with fractions. You walk two fifths of a kilometer

00:00:17.372 --> 00:00:21.522
and then three tenths of a kilometer. How far did you walk? When thinking about

00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:25.652
this problem, I know I need to do something with these fractions. I'm trying to

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:29.836
figure out the total distance I have to walk. So I should probably. Add these

00:00:29.848 --> 00:00:34.683
fractions together. So I have two fifth added to three tenths. Here I don't have

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:39.438
common denominators, I cannot just add these together. So let's see what we can

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.151
do. But you might be wondering what's a kilometer. A kilometer is a measure of

00:00:44.163 --> 00:00:48.772
distance. We use the letter km to stand for kilometer. There's also the word

00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:52.517
kilo. Kilo means a thousand. So we know one kilometer is really a thousand

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:58.130
meters. And you're probably wondering what's that distance like? So here's a

00:00:58.142 --> 00:01:03.505
picture of about a kilometer. In New York City, Central Park is about 849 meters

00:01:03.517 --> 00:01:08.430
across. 849 meters is just shy of 1,000 meters. So we know Central Park is.

00:01:08.742 --> 00:01:12.718
About a kilometer, but a little bit less then that. If you wanted to see for

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.515
yourself how long a kilometer is you could go outside, it takes about twelve

00:01:16.527 --> 00:01:20.685
minutes to walk a kilometer depending on how fast you walk. Alright, now that we

00:01:20.697 --> 00:01:24.971
know what a kilometer is let's get back to problem solving. Okay, I've rewritten

00:01:24.983 --> 00:01:28.619
our problem at the top, we walk two fifths of and then walked three tenths of a

00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:33.385
kilometer. How far did you walk? Let's picture this using a kilometer. I'm going

00:01:33.397 --> 00:01:37.654
to draw a bar that represents a kilometer. So this distance, or the full bar,

00:01:37.753 --> 00:01:42.258
would be one kilometer. Two fifths of a kilometer would only be this much. Let's

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.415
say the same thing for three tenths. Let's split up our kilometer bar into

00:01:46.427 --> 00:01:50.936
tenths. So I have a full kilometer bar, I have tenths, And three of them are

00:01:50.948 --> 00:01:55.326
shaded to repr esent three tenths of a kilometer. If I wanted to ever add two

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:59.497
fifths and three tenths together, it would look like this. I would have the two

00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:03.570
fifths and then the three tenths Don't fall into the trap of thinking this is

00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:07.668
five out of fifthteen. I don't have fifthteen equally divided regions here. Even

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.851
though I have five of them, they're not equally spaced. I can't add two fifhts

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:16.617
and three tenths together because I'm not dealing with the same dimensions or

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.662
length. I know one fifth of a kilometer is actually longer than one tenths of a

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:25.245
kilometer, so I can't simply add fifth and tenths together. Remember, I need to

00:02:25.257 --> 00:02:29.450
get a common denominator. So, what do you think? What would be the common

00:02:29.462 --> 00:02:33.353
denominator for two fifths and three tenths? You can enter your answer in this

00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:37.785
box here. Just give me only the denominator. What would you change tenths and

00:02:37.797 --> 00:02:38.465
fifths into?
