00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.030
So let's see what is going on with the code over here.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.930
The first thing to do, is to start using something called AVAudioEngine.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.560
Now this library, is packaged within the AVFoundation framework and

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.160
what it does, is it allows us to manipulate audio.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.290
So, as step one in our code,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.800
what we are going to do, is create an object of AVAudioEngine.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.710
Once we have done that, we will create an instance or

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.060
an object of something called AVAudioPlayerNode.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.990
You can think of this, as the thing that is connect to our mp3 file and

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.360
will actually play the recorded sound.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.529
Okay, let's create an object of this.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.720
Once you have done that, I will attach this to the AV audio engine.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.340
Let me do that now.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.190
Like that.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.170
In the next step, we will create something called AVAudioUnitTimePitch.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.190
This is the class that actually allows us to change the pitch of our audio.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.830
So let's do that next.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.972
And then, I will attach this to AVAudioEngine also.

00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:09.770
Like that.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.727
Then, towards the end, I will connect these two nodes together.

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.170
There.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.090
And then, finally, I will connect AVAudioUnitTimePitch,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.210
to some sort of an output, like the speakers, let me do that.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.230
There.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.720
Once all of this is done, we can play the audio.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.690
Oh, by the way, based on the value of the pitch in this effect.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.570
The recorded voice will sound like a chipmunk
