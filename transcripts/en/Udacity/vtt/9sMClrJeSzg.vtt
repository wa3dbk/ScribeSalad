00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Now that we talked about the detail of optimization problems

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.080
versus decision problems, we are ready to dive in.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.890
So how can we show that a problem is intractable?

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.880
We already know how to show that a problem is tractable.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.010
We just have to find a polynomial time algorithm for it.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.860
But how do we find out if the problem is intractable?

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.900
And there's actually two different ways we could go about this.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.190
The first way we could try to show intractability is by gathering evidence.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.880
What I mean by gathering evidence is this, we've already found out that Alice, Bob, and Carol

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.960
were working on problems for which they weren't able to find a polynomial time algorithm,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.790
but all of their problems were connected, so if one of them managed to find a solution

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.340
then all of their problems will be tractable, so one way we could be gathering evidence is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.330
if we just find more people working on more hard problems,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.060
and of course all of them are very smart people.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.220
If we could find more and more people who are also very smart working on very tough problems,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.310
but also no one of them finds a polynomial time algorithm.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.620
We could basically be saying, look, there are so many people who have looked at this problem,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:18.190
none of them has found out that the problem is tractable, so we think it must be intractable.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.410
Another way to go about this would be a mathematical proof.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.050
And what a mathematical proof would have to show is that no matter what kind of intricate,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.020
ingenious, sophisticated, complex algorithm we use for a problem,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.380
that algorithm will still need exponential time to solve the problem.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.640
So, what I would like you to think about for our next quiz is

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.220
the advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches here.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.090
And I would like you to think about two things.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.870
First of all, which of these approaches is probably easier to accomplish?

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.090
And secondly, which of these two approaches here would you find more convincing

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.390
to show that a problem is intractable?

00:01:58.390 --> 99:59:59.000
So please give me your two answers in these bubbles.
