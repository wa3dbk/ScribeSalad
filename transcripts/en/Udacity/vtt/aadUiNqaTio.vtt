00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.554
So far, we've concentrated on the major stimulants, but there is one minor

00:00:03.554 --> 00:00:06.830
stimulant that is so addictive that it needs mention, and this is nicotine,

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.099
which is the active ingredient in tobacco. Nicotine is a colorless, highly

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.015
volatile alkaloid liquid. Nicotine activates central nervous system activity

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:23.115
and it stimulates the release of dopamine. Tobacco is the leading preventable

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:27.812
cause of death and disease in the United States and worldwide tobacco use

00:00:27.812 --> 00:00:35.230
causes more than 5 million deaths per year. And finally, smokers die on average

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.794
about ten years earlier than do nonsmokers. Now, this is something very

00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:45.741
important to consider if you are a smoker. So we know tobacco use leads to both

00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:50.880
disease and disability, but let's look at some of those a little more closely.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.678
So tobacco youth leads to cancer, heart disease and stroke. In addition, it

00:00:56.678 --> 00:01:01.034
leads to several lung diseases, including emphysema, bronchitis and chronic

00:01:01.034 --> 00:01:06.884
airway obstruction. In addition, for every one death caused by tobacco, 20 more

00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:12.440
people suffer with at least one serious illness from smoking.
