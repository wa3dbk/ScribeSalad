00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.410
First thing's first, we noticed that both endpoints that we have are filled in.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.354
So I'm going to need to use square brackets for my intervals to show the

00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:12.846
inclusion of these points. Now, the point furthest to the left, in other words

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:17.097
the smallest x value that we have on this graph, is negative 4. So that's the

00:00:17.097 --> 00:00:21.300
lowest value of the domain for which the function has a value. Now, moving as

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.828
far right as we can along our curve. We come to this point, whose x coordinate

00:00:26.828 --> 00:00:31.930
is 6. So our interval goes from negative 4 to 6, including both endpoints. We

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.770
can check to make sure that our interval is right by testing a point outside of

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.946
the interval and seeing if the function has a value at that x coordinate. So

00:00:39.946 --> 00:00:46.290
let's say, I pick negative 8. That's right here and there is no function drawn

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.706
right here. I can't tell you what the function would equal. If you asked me what

00:00:50.706 --> 00:00:54.427
the value of the function was at negative 8, I could not give you any sort of

00:00:54.427 --> 00:00:58.500
reasonable answer. The function is just not defined for the input. In fact it's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.603
not defined for any input other than the x values of all the points here.
