00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.357
Let's see how a simple hierarchy works in practice. I'll make a robot with two

00:00:04.357 --> 00:00:09.098
parts to its arm, a forearm and an upper arm. This is kind of a classic computer

00:00:09.098 --> 00:00:13.980
graphics example, except that my robot is going to be a T850. The forearm is

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.328
this piece made of six objects. I run some tests on it and it looks good. I've

00:00:18.328 --> 00:00:21.292
made it so that the point where I'll attach it to the upper arm is at the

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:25.529
origin. I do this because I know that when a rotation is applied, the rotation

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.772
happens with respect to the point at the origin. Here's the code to create my

00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:34.104
forearm, there's not a lot to it. I create an Object3D, i call,

00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:39.724
createRobotExtender, and then I add the forearm to the scene, so I can see it.

00:00:39.725 --> 00:00:43.962
My createRobotExtender function adds a bunch of geometric objects to the forearm

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:48.200
object. A faLength is passed in to let this function know how tall to make the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.591
extender. It doesn't really matter what I add to the forearm object. The only

00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:56.371
rule is that whatever I put into this object, I need to remember that this

00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:01.286
object will itself rotate around the origin. I designed my upper arm in the same

00:01:01.286 --> 00:01:05.642
way and coded up about the same. Again, it rotates around the origin. The bit

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:09.548
we're interested in is how these two objects get hooked together so that the

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:12.987
forearm is the child of the upper arm. Here's the code that attaches the two

00:01:12.987 --> 00:01:17.524
objects together. We make the two arm pieces the same as before. The key

00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:21.418
difference is that instead of adding the forearm to the scene itself, we add the

00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:25.670
forearm to the upper arm. We also move the forearm to be at the top of the upper

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.426
arm. At this point the upper arm can be moved around, rotated, scaled and all of

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:33.250
its parts will be transformed in the same way. This is why we name this object

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.276
to be the arm instead of the upper arm, since in fact it holds both the upper

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:41.838
arm and the forearm. For example, if we set a rotation on the arm, the whole

00:01:41.838 --> 00:01:45.849
object will rotate. What's important to realize here is that the arm doesn't

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:49.417
particularly know or care what's inside any of its children. When I add the

00:01:49.417 --> 00:01:52.780
forearm to the arm, the forearm becomes just another part of the arm, no

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.038
different than adding a simple sphere or block. However, since we can manipulate

00:01:57.038 --> 00:02:01.326
any object by changing its transforms, we can also change the position of the

00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:04.950
forearm itself. So changing the angle with this line of code, will change the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.780
angle of the forearm without affecting anything else. The transform order is the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.320
forearms rotation and translation, followed by the arms rotation and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.007
translation. This means the forearm can be transformed however you wish, without

00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:20.380
knowing about the arm as a whole. The arms transforms are applied later. Give

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.183
the demo a try to see how the two parts interact with their separate controls.
