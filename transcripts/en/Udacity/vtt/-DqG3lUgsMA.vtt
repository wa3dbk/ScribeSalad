00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.760
Welcome back, in this session we're
going to talk about variables and

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.700
constants.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.308
Two different ways to
assign a name to a value.

00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:11.105
Variables and constants are fundamental
units of programming they allow us to

00:00:11.105 --> 00:00:13.820
store information so
we can use it later when we need it.
