In this exercise you'll add a body to the robot this body is created by the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.350
create robot body function you'll see it in the code. This body can rotate and

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.193
has the upper arm attached to its top your job is to add this body to the robots

00:00:11.193 --> 00:00:14.430
design. When your done your robot arm should look like this you might want to

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.530
turn off the display of the other two arm parts while you're testing out the

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.440
body itself. Simply comment out the line of code that adds the arm to the scene.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.316
If you really want to get fancy, you can add a y axis control for the body

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:28.919
itself. It's pretty easy to do this, just three lines of code. Take a look in

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.933
the user interface set up gui method and in the render method.
