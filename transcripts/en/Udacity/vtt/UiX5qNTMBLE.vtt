00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.608
You're more likely to want a default
value for type properties,

00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:05.289
also called class properties.

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:09.349
You can think of class properties as
belonging more to the class itself than

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.229
to any one instance of a class because
they don't vary across objects.

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:17.664
A type property has the same value for
every instance of a class.

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:19.680
We use type properties mostly for

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.354
data we want every instance of
a class to have easy access to.

00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:25.958
For example,
if we had a class called kids movie,

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.182
we might want to type property
called permitted ratings to keep

00:00:29.182 --> 00:00:32.039
track of which ratings
are permissible for children.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.029
To indicate the permitted
ratings as a type property,

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:38.353
we place the word static or
class in front of its definition.

00:00:38.353 --> 00:00:42.793
Type properties are also referred to as
static properties in languages like C

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:43.415
and Java.

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:46.203
The value of this property
won't change across movies, but

00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:48.617
it's nice to have these
ratings at our fingertips.

00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:51.899
It'd also be nice if we had some
information about the reviews for

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:52.680
these movies.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.699
Let's add an array of reviews
from different media outlets.

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:56.708
But then, of course,

00:00:56.708 --> 00:01:00.228
it'd be really convenient if we could
see the average of the reviewer scores.

00:01:00.228 --> 00:01:03.361
Let's call it a metascore,
like the app Metacritic.

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:06.183
Such a metascore is known
as a computed property,

00:01:06.183 --> 00:01:09.886
a property that's computed based
on existing data in the class.

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:13.903
Computed properties have custom
getters and optionally custom setters.

00:01:13.903 --> 00:01:16.202
This one doesn't really
need a setter though.

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:17.688
Here's our custom getter.

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:20.544
You probably haven't seen
this reduce function before.

00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:24.909
It's a handy method for reducing
the values of an array to one value.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.492
For a fun challenge, see if you can
figure out exactly what this code is

00:01:28.492 --> 00:01:31.249
doing and post what you find
on the discussion forum.

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:34.308
For now, I'll just tell you that
it's returning the average of all

00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:35.497
the scores in this array.

00:01:35.497 --> 00:01:36.845
Let's test out our getter.

00:01:36.845 --> 00:01:40.308
We'll initialize a movie with
some reviewer scores and

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:43.114
then access the metascore
using dot syntax.

00:01:43.114 --> 00:01:43.903
Sweet!

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.854
This one ought to be a crowd-pleaser.

00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:49.955
Now, in looking at the custom getter for
our metascore,

00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:53.122
it may have occurred to you,
wait a second.

00:01:53.122 --> 00:01:56.581
What about the getters and
setters for the other properties?

00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:57.325
Guess what?

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:59.321
We don't have to write them.

00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:01.790
They're automatically created
when you declare a property.
