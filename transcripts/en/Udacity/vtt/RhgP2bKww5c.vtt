00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.088
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; First we'll use what's probably the simplest method.

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:08.960
Recall that the reason that a trivial parallelization didn't work was that the read, modify, write

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.356
operation that we needed to increment a bin was actually 3 separate operations--

00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:18.415
a global memory read, a local increment in a register and a global memory write.

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:22.939
What if we could make this read, modify, write operation here,

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.626
actually be 1 operation instead of 3?

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:29.594
If it was only 1 operation, it could not be interrupted by another thread.

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:34.600
Now, we call such an operation atomic, and as we learned last unit,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.595
modern GPU's support atomic operations to memory.

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:42.365
What the GPU does, in essence, is locks down a particular memory location during the

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:46.716
read, modify, write process, so that no other thread can access it.

00:00:46.716 --> 00:00:51.589
This is a simple change in the code. So we're only going to change 1 line in the code.

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.786
Here's our naive histogram, here's this new histogram that we're doing,

00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:57.528
and you notice we're only going to change the last line.

00:00:57.528 --> 00:01:01.327
We're changing this simple increment here to an atomic increment.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:04.037
It's a simple change, but let's see the effect.

00:01:04.037 --> 00:01:08.618
So now we're going to run the histogram program using simple histo instead of naive histo.

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:15.934
And we see when we do that we get the expected 4096 elements per bin, great news.

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:20.169
Now the disadvantage of this technique, is that it serializes access

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:22.827
to any particular bin during the atomic operation.

00:01:22.827 --> 00:01:25.779
Many threads might want to update that bin,

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:29.651
but only one thread at a time actually gets to do so, and so the others have to wait.

00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:34.793
This contention for the atomic will likely be the performance limiter in any histogram code.

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:39.391
So let's say you have a million measurements, with which you'd like to calculate a histogram.

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:44.926
You can choose to have 10 bins, 100 bins, or 1,000 bins in your

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:50.576
histogram if you use the atomic method, which will most likely run fastest.
