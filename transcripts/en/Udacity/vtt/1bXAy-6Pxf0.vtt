00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.939
Let's just first find what this value should be. We have 2.064 standard errors

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:15.264
below 1700. So this should be 1700 minus 2.064 standard errors, which is 200

00:00:15.264 --> 00:00:27.322
divided by the square root of 25. This calculates to $1,617.44. And then we'll

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:32.575
do the same thing with this value on the right of 1700. We have 1700 plus 2.064

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:42.344
standard errors, and this comes out to $1,782.56. And there we have our 95%

00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:45.522
confidence interval.
