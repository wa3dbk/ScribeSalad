00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.270
The first answer is negative 12 plus 8i, and the second answer is 22 plus 14i.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.313
If you figured either one of these out, great work. We start this first one by

00:00:11.313 --> 00:00:17.136
distributing the 4i to 2 and to 3i. 4i times 2 equals 8i, and 4i times 3i

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:23.156
equals positive 12i squared. This is just kind of like x times x. We know x

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:28.506
times x is x squared, so i times i is i squared. Okay, here comes the important

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:33.324
part. We want to substitute i squared with the value of negative 1. So here's

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:37.570
an i squared, so I'll replace it with negative 1. This is the key step to

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.820
multiply complex numbers. You already know about distribution, and you already

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.820
know about combining like terms, but you might not have known about that

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.120
substitution. This is how we get a result of positive 12 plus 8i. For complex

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.640
numbers, we usually list the real part first followed by the imaginary part.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.237
This is why I put the negative 12 here. We either have a plus bi, or we have a

00:00:59.237 --> 00:01:04.750
minus bi. These are the two forms that we'll see. For our second problem, we

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.208
start by distributing this positive 3 to the 4 and to negative 2i. Next, we

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:14.200
want to distrubte the 5i to our second parentheses. We'll have 5i times

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.676
positive 4, and 5i time negative 2i. We can clean up our multiplication to get

00:01:20.676 --> 00:01:28.621
12 minus 6i plus 20i minus 10i squared. We have like terms of i, so negative 6i

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:35.410
and 20i equals positive 14i. The other terms stay the same. Next, we have i

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.395
squared. So we need to replace that with negative 1. This means we'll have

00:01:40.395 --> 00:01:46.160
negative 10 times negative 1, which would equal positive 10. Whenever we have

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.220
an i square term it essentially makes the number negative. Like here, we had

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.792
12i squared and we get negative 12. Whereas here, we have negative 10i squared

00:01:55.792 --> 00:02:00.635
and we get positive 10. Now we're ready to combine our final like terms of 12

00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:04.561
and 10 to get our final result. Now again, don't worry if you struggled with

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:07.930
this one. You'll have a chance at the next one.
