00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
Now, the important thing to understand to be able to figure this out here

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.150
is that if the Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:15.148
then a shortest path from A to B that visits all vertices can visit each of these vertices

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:19.849
by basically paying just one extra edge.

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:26.070
Instead of going this way, we have to go this way exactly once for each clause.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.130
The length of the shortest path from A to B that visits all vertices

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:39.390
is the same as the shortest path from A to B that does not visit the clause vertices plus m

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.520
because we have to pay one extra edge for each clause vertex that we visit here.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.520
It's something plus m and we know that

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.490
there is a path between A and B that visits each vertex exactly once,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.950
and so, the path length from A to B is almost the same as the number of vertices,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.880
it's just one less, so you can see this here in the example.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.300
If I have two vertices then the shortest path would mean those vertices is one so one less

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.750
If I go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 vertices then the path has length four and so on.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.340
What we have here is 5n + 3 mn +1 and then we have to add m.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.159
Our total here is 5m + 3mn +1. And now, we are almost done.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.950
We have shown that if the Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:41.240
then the length of the shortest path from A to B that visits all vertices has length 5n + m + 3mn +1

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.310
Where n is the number of variables and m is the number of clauses.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.840
Now, we also have to show the other direction of course.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.640
If there is a shortest path between A and B of length 5n + m + 3mn +1

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.950
then each clause in the Boolean Formula can be satisfied.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.640
We have a satisfying assignment.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.620
Right now, we have shown that if the Boolean formula is satisfied

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.030
then we have a path of this length and now, we need to show the other direction as well of course.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.900
If we have a path of this length then the Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.710
Why do we need to show those two directions?

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.709
That is because the requirement for reduction is that our new instance that we constructed here

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.920
is a yes instance if and only if this Boolean formula up here has a satisfying assignment

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.640
Right now, we have shown the if and now, we have to show the only if,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.190
but this is actually quite easy because if we know that there is a path

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.450
between A and B of this length here then we already know

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.810
that each vertex is visited exactly once because this is the bear minimum of a tour between A and B

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.920
given this many vertices.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.990
Secondly, we know that the tour will correspond to a variable assignment

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.430
It will correspond to an assignment of true and false to these vertices here

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.640
because otherwise we would visit a city more than once.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.300
We've already shown that and finally, we have also shown that each clause can be satisfied

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.760
because we can only visit a vertex down here like that with paying just one extra edge

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.180
if the assignment up here corresponds to a satisfying assignment.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.320
And now, we are almost done in showing that shortest tour is NP complete.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.750
I don't know if you noticed, but there is one small detail missing

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.530
Right now, we are only going from A to B and we are asking for the shortest path from A to B.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.780
We are not asking for shortest tour yet and that is actually quite easy to fix.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:35.870
We'll just remove this vertex B here and make this edge very, very, very, very long over here

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.280
and then it's not the length of the shortest path from A to B anymore,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.510
but it's the length of the shortest tour.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.670
And of course, that length is only true if and only if the Boolean formula is satisfiable

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.420
And we're done. We have reduced SAT to a shortest tour.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.060
We have shown that shortest tour is in NP.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.530
So, now, our final conclusion this problem here is NP-complete

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.650
Of course, it's a bit ironic that showing that a problem such as shortest tour is NP complete

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.960
can sometimes feel like solving an NP complete problem in itself.

00:04:06.960 --> 99:59:59.000
That's why I would now like to show you how to even further simplify that problem is NP complete.
