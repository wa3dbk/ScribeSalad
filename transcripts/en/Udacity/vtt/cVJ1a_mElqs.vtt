00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.140
Our new circle, is centered at the point 20,0 here and it has this equation.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.646
That's amazing thought if you got it correct. We know that for this blue

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:16.090
circle, the radius still needs to be 50 units. This is why we still have 2500

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.150
on the right-hand side for our constant. The square root of this number is 50,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.828
our radius. Notice that for this orange circle and for this blue circle, the y

00:00:26.828 --> 00:00:33.800
values never changed. We're at the same height for any point along our graph.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.543
In other words, we only shifted the graph to the right. So, the only thing we

00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:44.257
really changed or manipulated were the x values. We moved all of our points 20

00:00:44.257 --> 00:00:49.994
units to the right. So, the x values all increase by 20. To compensate for this

00:00:49.994 --> 00:00:54.530
adjustment, we need to subtract 20 from all our x values to maintain the same

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.586
radius. So, for circles if we subtract something from x we really shift it to

00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:07.499
the right that many units. So, subtracting 20 moves this circle 20 unit to the

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:14.326
right. So, if we add 20, we'll actually move our circle 20 units to the left. I

00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:17.224
really recommend playing around with this equation to see how you can move a

00:01:17.224 --> 00:01:23.281
circle around on a graph. Maybe see if you can make it go up or down.
