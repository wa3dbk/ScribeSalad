00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, it's time to implement the diffusion equation in 2D.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Of course, the arrays for the old and the new temperatures are now 2-dimensional arrays,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we initialize the arrays by putting in a right angle of high temperature.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You may wonder about the order of y and x here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Shouldn't x be the first one and y be the second one.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We use this order with the y appearing first and the x appearing last

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because we stick to the idea of the arrays being matrices.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
With the matrix, the first index refers to the number of the row

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and the second index refers to the number of the column.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Changing the row mean to go up or down, which is like changing y,

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and changing the column means to go left or right, which works like changing x.
