00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.820
So let's wrap up what we've talked about today.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.530
We started off today by talking about state spaces and we used this to

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.120
frame our discussion of mean-ends analysis. Means-ends analysis is a very

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.650
general purpose problem solving method, that allows us to look at our goal and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.780
try to continually move towards it. We then use means-ends analysis to try and

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.940
address a couple of different kinds of problems. But when we did so,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.890
we hit an obstacle. To overcome that obstacle, we used problem reduction.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.930
We can use problem reduction in a lot of other problem solving contexts, but

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.000
here we use it to specifically to overcome the obstacle we hit during means-ends

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
analysis. Problem reduction occurs and we take a big hard problem and introduce

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.600
it into smaller easier problems. By solving the smaller easier problems,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.340
we solve the big hard problem. Next time we're going to talk about production

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.760
systems, which are the last part of the fundamental areas of our course. But

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.530
if you're particularly interested in what we've talked about today, you may wish

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.590
to jump forward to logic and planning. Those were built specifically on

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.800
the types of the problems we talked about today. And in fact in planning,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.170
we'll see a more robust way of solving the kinds of obstacles that we hit,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.890
during our exercise with means and analysis earlier in this lesson.
