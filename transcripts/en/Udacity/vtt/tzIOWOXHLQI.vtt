00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Starting from the bottom, if I remove the last line,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we never actually call mistletoe, so our program just declares a variable,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
declares a function, and then exits,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so we don't see the exception.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So we can't remove this line.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Let's take a look up here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What if I comment out baldr is baldr + 1?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Well, with our bug in environment lookup, this line a gets a + 2

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
will still cause us to die.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So we can remove baldr is baldr + 1 and still see the exception.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
How about this one?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If I remove a is a + 2, we'll still see the exception down here

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in baldr is baldr + a.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We'll look up the value of a and not find it. So I can remove that line.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Similarly, if I remove this third line, we can still die on line 2.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So now, potentially, we have a lot of information available to us.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We know that we need to make this call,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we know that these 3 lines are important,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and in a more fully formed integrated development environment

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or interpreter like the Python interpreter, we'd get an exception backtrace

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that would point us to this line

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
or, if we've commented out that line, point us to the next one.

00:01:08.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So with all of this information, we get a better feel for what's actually required.
