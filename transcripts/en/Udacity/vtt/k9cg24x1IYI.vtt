00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Suppose we want to use regular expressions

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to recognize phone numbers with or without hyphens.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is super common in electronic commerce.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here I have 2 positive examples from the American phone system,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
123-4567 and 1234567.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But we want our business to be international,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so we also want to accept numbers in other formats,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
like these French telephone numbers, which have 5 groups of 2

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
if they're separated by hyphens or just 10 digits otherwise.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And in general, we want to allow any number of groups of any non-empty size

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
separated by 1 hyphen where each group is 0 through 9+.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And my hint is you should remember to accept a super small phone number

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
like 5--presumably from many years ago when there weren't that many phones--

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but do not accept -6 because there is nothing on the left of the hyphen.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This problem is tricky, and you should submit via the interpreter

00:00:51.000 --> 09:59:59.000
by defining a variable called regexp that encodes this.
