00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:09.032
Positive and negative 2.33 is called the critical value of Z for 98% confidence.

00:00:09.032 --> 00:00:16.234
And if you remember, positive and negative 1.96 are the critical values of Z for

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:21.054
95% confidence. If you worked your way through lesson 6 and really understood

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:25.234
it, then finding the critical values of Z should be pretty easy for you. But

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:31.088
it's still a pretty difficult conceptual idea. So don't get too discouraged if

00:00:31.088 --> 00:00:35.546
you're finding this pretty confusing. I would suggest watching these videos and

00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:40.249
pausing them all the time to really think about what I'm saying and writing.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.017
There are also a lot of really important definitions. So you have to remember

00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:49.362
what a Z score is, and what the standard deviation is, the sampling

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:54.184
distribution. And you have to remember that the standard deviation of the

00:00:54.184 --> 00:01:00.252
sampling distribution is called the standard error. And then you need to be able

00:01:00.252 --> 00:01:05.894
to express values of sample means in terms of standard errors away from the

00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:10.365
population mean. If you can do all those things and you understand these

00:01:10.365 --> 00:01:15.204
concepts, then you'll be fine in this lesson. If not, do go back and review

00:01:15.204 --> 00:01:20.038
those videos. And do the problems that's in quizzes. Because that will really

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:20.794
help you.
