00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.800
In the last few lessons, we have learned a lot about exponential and

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.710
logarithmic functions. We have learned how to recognize their graphs, and

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.780
evaluate points on their graphs. We looked at how to manipulate exponential and

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.360
logarithmic functions, how to switch between them, and when we could not

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.830
evaluate logs, how to change their bases. Lastly, we looked at the relevance of

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.380
these functions in our daily lives. We hope you will reviewed the material in

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.020
both the practice sets and the problem sets. Best of luck to you, we know your

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.668
going to do well.
