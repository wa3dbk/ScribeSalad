00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.340
All right. There's one more class of randomized optimization

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.970
algorithms that is really attractive. It's, it's, the, it's very

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.120
interesting to people. It has proven itself time and time

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.550
and again. And it's this notion of genetic algorithms. So

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.250
the main insight that's exploited in the genetic algorithm setting

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.360
is this. So let's imagine we've got a two dimensional

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.100
space. And, it's you know, hard for me to actually

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.400
draw a, a fitness surface over a two dimensional space.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.100
So just kind of think of this as being one of

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.290
those maps. Those contour maps. And so imagine that we've

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.080
got, one dimension that X now comes in, in these

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.440
two different dimensions. And What we're trying to do is find

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.470
the peak, which happens to be there. So what if,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.818
we actually evaluate 3 different points, so these green points

00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:46.620
here, we actually check what the values are at these

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.350
points. So what we find is that, from this initial point,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.700
this green point here. If we increase our dimension 2, we

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.260
get a better value. But, it's also the case. It's starting from

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.367
that point. If we increase on dimension 1, we get a

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:02.630
better value. So, maybe, what we, we ought to do, is take

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.350
kind of elements of these 2 solutions, these 2 inputs and combine

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.898
them together, and move out on dimension 1 and dimension 2, and

00:01:10.898 --> 00:01:13.190
maybe that will actually give us a good score as well.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.020
And in this particular case, it puts us in the base interaction

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.920
of the local maxima. So, this turned out to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.160
be useful in many spaces, especially spaces that can be

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.670
specified combinatorially like this. Where there is this separate dimensions

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.300
that contribute in various ways to the overall fitness value.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.620
&gt;&gt; Ok Michael, that sort of makes sense. But, what does

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.630
this have to do with genetics or algorithms for that matter?

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.880
&gt;&gt; Well, it's an algorithm in that we're doing, it's an

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.130
optimization algorithm, and the genetic part, is because what we're going to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.890
do, is were going to build an analogy with Biological evolution.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.880
&gt;&gt; Mm, analogies.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.480
&gt;&gt; In particular, instead of thinking about these input

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.770
points, these little green dots, we're going to think of them

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.240
as each input point is like an individual, and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.430
a group of them taken together is like a population.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.950
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. It's really the same idea, but

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.920
we're just giving it a different name. Okay.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.300
&gt;&gt; The the idea of local search where you make little changes

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.130
to a, to an input, we're going to now call that mutation. All right?

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.930
Where you take an individual and kind of tweak it a little bit

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.360
&gt;&gt; Oh, like we did in the the, the example we

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.500
did before where we define the neighborhood as every one, difference

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.710
in every single bit. That's right. So, so the mutations can

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.410
happen along neighborhoods. It's the same kind of concept as that.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.890
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.620
&gt;&gt; And then, you know? And, and, you can

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.260
see that there's, the mutations happening over X. So,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.560
I assume that you get X [UNKNOWN].

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.240
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think that's a fair point. I like your science.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right. It

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.850
is science. The, those are all concepts

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.260
that we were already using when we

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.740
were doing these other randomized optimization algorithms.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.050
One thing that's different though, is the

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.070
notion of crossover. So, what crossover does,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.630
is it takes different points, like this green point and this green point and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.060
instead of moving them just to their own neighborhood, it

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.840
gives you a way of combining their attributes together with

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.730
the hope of creating something even better. So, that is

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.510
where it starts to actually kind of deviate from the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.630
standard notion of local search or randomized optimization. And gets

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.920
us into something that, that feels a little more like

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.750
evolution. So, this is kind of like. Dare I say

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.810
sexual reproduction. Right, where the two parents can actually form a

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.560
new kind of offspring that you know, if you're lucky is has

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.162
all the positive attributes of both of the parents. Like my children.

00:03:29.162 --> 00:03:31.630
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, and if you're unlucky, it has the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.970
worse attributes of the parents, like other peoples children.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.050
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.630
Exactly. And so, and finally what we were calling

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.120
iteration before in the context of genetic algorithms, we

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.390
can call it generation. Because we're going to take, a

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.880
population of individuals and kind of you know, mate them together

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.220
to create a new population of individuals. And we're

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.360
going to, what we hope is improve iteration by iteration.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.750
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense. So, If I can just push

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.150
on this a minute, it seems like, if it weren't for crossover,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.480
this is really like doing random restart, except instead of doing restarts

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.700
you just do 'em all at once cause we have parallel computers.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's I think that's fair. I think that's quite fair

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.270
actually. Okay. So then the thing that makes it more than that is, crossover.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.550
That somehow these parallel, random searches are bleeding

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.300
information back and forth, help maybe bleeds the wrong.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.720
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, you don't want to get too biological about this.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.800
&gt;&gt; Yes, right. Well, so they're

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.010
sharing fluids, metaphorically, with one another

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.660
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]. And conveying information that way, just the

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.230
way genes do. Right. And then, and so that's

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.980
the sort of interesting concept that now we have

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.290
information, not just in the individual, like we're moving

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.370
that one individual around and trying to find better and

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.170
better solutions. But the population as a whole, represents a

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.470
distribution over individuals. And that, that distribution might actually be

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.910
a useful thing to guide the search for higher scoring individuals.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.260
&gt;&gt; Okay. That, that makes sense.
