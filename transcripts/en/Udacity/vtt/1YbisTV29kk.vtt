00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer is simple. You take 60%.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You subtract 3 to get 57 as the lower bound and 63 as the upper bound.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The confidence interval of 57-63 means we are fairly confident that given our current sample,

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
election day will give party A an outcome within this range.
