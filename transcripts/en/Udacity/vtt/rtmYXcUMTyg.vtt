00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.331
Right now the thing that is keeping x from being by itself on this side is this

00:00:04.343 --> 00:00:08.501
plus 3 right here. If that weren't part of the equation, if we just had for

00:00:08.513 --> 00:00:12.844
example, x equals 12; then we wouldn't have very much work to do. We'd already

00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:17.138
have a solution to our equation. However it is here, so we need to figure out

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.655
how to get rid of it. So how do we undo addition? Subtraction.

00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:25.294
To make it so that nothing extra is added to the left side, we need to subtract

00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:30.096
3 from the left side. That will make it so this entire side of our equation says

00:00:30.108 --> 00:00:34.744
x plus 3 minus 3. Now if we saw this as just an expression, we would know how to

00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:39.589
simplify that. The 3's would just cancel one another out since 3 minus 3 is 0

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:44.235
and we would have x plus 0 or just x. That's a super important step in moving

00:00:44.247 --> 00:00:48.923
forward in solving our equation. But wait, important. Whatever we do to the left

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:53.277
hand side of the equation, we also have to do the right side, so we make sure

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.656
that these 2 sides are still equal to one another, so I need to put in minus 3

00:00:57.668 --> 00:00:59.406
here underneath the 12 as well.
