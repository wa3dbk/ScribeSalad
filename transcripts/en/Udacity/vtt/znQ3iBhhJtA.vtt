00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.680
Let's assume that the school also kept attendance per grade.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.140
In this case, we've added a third column, grade, to our data.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.930
So each row now represents for a given date and a given grade.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.800
How many students attended school on that day.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.150
Now if d3 or whichever library we're using, they implement some of

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.770
the principles of the grammar of graphics wasn't so flexible.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.460
If we've added another column to our data and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.317
it was tightly coupled to how we represented it.

00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:37.827
We may have to redo a bunch of work we previously done to draw the same lines,

00:00:37.827 --> 00:00:39.780
to draw the same axis's.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.840
But in our case, and we'll see later when I go through some live code examples.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.130
Adding another column, or in this case a categorical variable,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.270
allows us to keep a lot of aesthetic and reapply that aesthetic.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.680
In this case, three times.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.340
One for each grade.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.747
And if our data set had grade 12 in it,

00:01:02.747 --> 00:01:08.660
we would have a separate line for 9th, 10th, and 11th grade.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.210
Something interesting we see hear is that it appears 10th graders were not

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.120
affected by the flu.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.100
While we have 9th and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.860
11th graders with a severe dip in attendance during the later winter months.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.660
10th graders, for whatever reason, have seemed to avoided the flu.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.840
Due to the flexibility of the grammar of graphics, we were able to apply

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.700
the same aesthetic, in this case, a line, and the same axes to different data.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.970
In this case, data that has a great column added and is categorized by day.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.270
So instead of having to redo all the work of specifying how to draw a line.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.790
And how it integrates with our data.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.100
We simply split up our data by grade and draw in one line for each category.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.230
In this case, the grade
