00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is that it's theoretically impossible

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to compute this for an arbitrary sequence.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The first answer is not correct.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If S is truly random, this would be correct.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But if S is not truly random, there might be some shorter way to compute it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So this gives the maximum value of the Kolmogorov Complexity

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
of sequence length S.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And an example of such a program would just be this Python program,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that would be the program "print" + S.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That would print out the sequence S.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's length would be the length of S plus the 5 characters for the print

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
plus 1 for the space.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But that doesn't prove that there isn't a shorter program that can produce S.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The trick in the second answer is this part.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This assumes that we can execute P to completion.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In order to do that, we would need to solve the halting problem.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We would need to know that P will either never finish

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
or know how long to wait to keep running P.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So we can't actually do this step.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This might run forever; this loop may never finish.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So we would never learn the result. So that's why this doesn't work.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is not enough to prove that it's impossible,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
because maybe there's some other way to do it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And I'm not going to go through

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
how we actually prove that the Kolmogorov Complexity is uncomputable,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but I'm going to show you a paradox that will give you a little bit of an idea

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
why that is.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The paradox is known as the Berry Paradox.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What the paradox asks is,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
"What is the smallest natural number--"

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and by that I mean the set of numbers 1, 2, &amp; 3--

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
sometimes we'll design it starting from 0--

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the paradox would work just as well either way--

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
"that cannot be described in eleven words?"

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So this seems like a reasonable question.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We can define the set of numbers that cannot be described in eleven words.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It seems like a perfectly reasonable description of a set.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It's also a case that any set of natural numbers

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
has the smallest element.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The numbers are well-ordered, so whatever that set is,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
there must be some smallest number.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So that means there should be an answer to this question--

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that there is a smallest number that cannot be described in eleven words.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And I'm going to describe it for you.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Here's my description.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And my description has 1-2-3-10-11 words.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So I just described the smallest natural number

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that cannot be described in eleven words,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but I've described it in eleven words.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So that suggests that no such number exists,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
but that contradicts the properties we had before.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That's why this is a paradox.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This is certainly not a proof that the Kolmogorov Complexity is undecidable,

00:02:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
But it should give you some sense of how we might prove that.
