00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.880
Here's the Graphpad website. We want to calculate P from our T statistics. And

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.340
again, we want to calculate P from T, so that's this first option. And here we

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.785
got that our T statistic is 0.977. And our degrees of freedom is 7, because we

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:25.816
had 8 values. Compute P, and indeed, we get that our P value is between 0.3 and

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:32.820
0.4, 0.3611. And the website even tells you that by conventional criteria,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.198
usually by alpha level equals 0.5. This difference is considered to be not

00:00:37.198 --> 00:00:43.335
statistically significant. We got 0.3611. This is not statistically significant

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:51.198
and that's because the probability is greater than our alpha level. Remember

00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:56.795
that our alpha level is 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null. We're

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:00.890
sticking to the assumption that the population that our sample is from, is not

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.933
significantly different from 10. Great job.
