00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is many, many things that we should be worried about.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The attacker might not learn the exact size, because of padding on the request

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
up to the block size.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The same thing for the responses. The attacker also learns the pattern.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This reveals a lot about a webpage.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Because of optimizations and HTTP, there are often multiple responses to one request.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This could be because the large page is broken into many responses.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It could be because there are many images on the page, and they respond,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and although they would normally require separate requests,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because of caching they could be sent before those requests.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
These patterns are very distinguishing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Different webpages will have different sizes of response as well as a different pattern.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
An example of where this is particularly dangerous

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
in modern web applications--we're using HTTPS connected to Google.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now when I type a letter, I get a response.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's filling up the guesses of what I'm going to type next.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The size of this response depends on the letter than I typed.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If I type another letter, I get a different response.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You can see that udacity is the most popular word starting with "ud,"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
at least according to when I'm using Google.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I don't know if that's true for everyone.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But that size differs, and if I type another letter I get a different response.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The size of these responses depend on the letters I'm typing.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The length of these words will effect the size of the response.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You can build a model that would identify what someone is typing

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
based on the sizes of these responses.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
There is a paper by a group from Microsoft Research that shows some of these vulnerabilities

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and how much information that an attacker can learn from that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
There's another paper by Peter Chapman and myself,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and you may remember Peter if you took CS101. He was the TA for that.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It looked at ways of measuring this and understanding how much information is really leaking.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This is a serious attack.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It's something that even though the encryption is there, that an attacker can learn a lot

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
about what's going on on a webpage.
