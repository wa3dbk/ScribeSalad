00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.010
So there are all these different ways
you can think about what recognition is.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.970
And one of the two main distinctions
we've already talked about, but

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.500
it pays to point it out again,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.890
is this difference between
single instance labeling, okay?

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.900
So here's a picture of a car.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.940
And we say, you know, that's John's car.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.100
Okay, and so we want to be able to find
that particular thing versus we'd like

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.090
to be able to find all of these
things and say, okay, those are cars.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.160
For the most part, we're going to
be worrying about this problem,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.210
the generic categorization problem,
okay?

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.450
So object categorization
described in a variety of ways.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.560
This is a slide from Kristin and Barrett
Leibe, and that I changed a little bit.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.010
Generically it's kind of like this.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.598
Given some number of training examples,
training images of a category, recognize

00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:50.260
some a-priori unknown instances of that
category and assign the correct label.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.400
Now you notice that I put down
small in parentheses, you know,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.480
right here it says small.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.400
These days not a lot of work
is done on the small number?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.660
That is that, typically we
have lots of large examples.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.610
And there's a question about
how method's that go from

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.260
taking large data could
then use small data?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.440
To me that's a slightly more
interesting problem, but

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.350
we'll leave the small as being
sort of optional at this point.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.490
But the basic idea is that I give
you a set of these things and

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.490
some sort of labels, and you want to
give me back the correct label.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.190
All right.
So one of the things we have to do,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.980
before we can even proceed is,
we have to agree on a set of labels.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.920
And there's this fundamental
problem that a single object

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.710
doesn't have a unique label.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.670
So here we have somebody's dog,
apparently named Fido,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.200
I don't know if anybody names
their dogs Fido anymore.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.940
So you can say well this is Fido or
you could say this is a German shepherd.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.410
You could say this is a dog.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.310
You could say, doesn't say, say it's
a mammal, you could say it's an animal.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.440
You could say it's a living thing
although a living being is probably I

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.410
don't know out there.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.240
But it, it is these things, right, so
there's this question is what categories

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.370
are best for visual identification or
which ones do we agree upon.
