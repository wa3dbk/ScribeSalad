00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.984
On our graph, the y values range from on the lower end negative 1 to on the

00:00:05.984 --> 00:00:10.940
upper hand positive 6. However, we know that neither negative 1 nor 6 is

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.898
included in our range, because the points that these values come from have those

00:00:15.898 --> 00:00:17.277
open circles on them.
