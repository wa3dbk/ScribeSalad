00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.850
I'll start by creating a JQuery collection of all the elements of

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.580
class article-item.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.740
Then I'll call find on the article-items, and

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.050
pass it ul to find all instances of unordered lists in the collection.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.250
Now, I have to be careful.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.370
I am actually telling jQuery to select all ul's from any of the article-items.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.350
In this case, I only have one, right here.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.940
But if I had more than one, I'd need to use a more specific selector or

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.715
filter it somehow, otherwise I'd delete other ul elements.

00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:39.080
At this point I'll simply remove the ul and presto, it is gone.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.460
Alternatively, according to the documentation, you can

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.660
also pass a selector into .remove to only remove specific elements from the DOM.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.660
For instance, if you only wanted to remove elements with class bold,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.700
you could pass in the selector .bold and you'd only see James disappear.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.890
You can hit Test.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.929
Scroll down, and James is gone.
