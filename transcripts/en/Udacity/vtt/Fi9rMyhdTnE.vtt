00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.490
One cheap technique to give a material a slightly different look is to use

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.260
what's called wrap lighting. Remember with toon rendering, how we shifted where

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.300
the diffuse term went from light to dark? We can do the same sort of shift with

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.540
the diffuse term, but not simply threshold the value. You're task is to change

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.300
the diffuse term to be this wrap lighting term. See the additional course

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.290
material for more information about how this works. When you're done the ramp

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.200
slider will suddenly alter the look of the surface. This equation is from an

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.550
article on skin rendering by Simon Green. This lighting change is not a huge

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.310
effect for teapots but can give a more realistic look to some materials.
