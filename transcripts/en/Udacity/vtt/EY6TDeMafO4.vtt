00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.190
Let's now look at the solution for our N-Bit history predictor quiz.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.395
We said that we want to have an N-Bit history predictor 2-bit counters per

00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:13.760
possible history and we need 1,024 entries like that. And now we want to

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.372
compute the cost for these predictors, how well they do on the N N N T pattern,

00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:24.170
and also how many of the 2-bit counters do they actually use in the NT

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.160
repeating pattern. The cost can be computed as simply the size of the history,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.802
plus we need 2 to the nth 2-bit counters for each entry. And

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:42.693
if you compute what this is,

00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:48.930
it amounts to 532,480 bits. So this is around

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.430
half a megabit of predictor stuff for just 1,024 entries.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.813
With N equals 16, we're talking about

00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:06.350
134,234,112 bits. So this is many,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.160
many megabits worth of predictor stuff. Again, for the same number of entries.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.940
As you can see, this is probably not a realistic predictor at all. And

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.170
even this one probably you don't want to spend that much harder on

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.360
just branch prediction. Let's now see how well they do on the N N N T pattern.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.550
This is a pattern of length four, so anything that has N equal three or

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.690
more will handle it well. So from that perspective, all three of these will

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.910
do well. These two will do well on even longer patterns, and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.920
finally how many of those two big counters did we have are we actually using for

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.230
the, not taken taken not taken, taken. Think about it this way, for

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.140
the N equals 1, when we need to predict the taken branch.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.540
We have a history of just 0, because it's a single bit history.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.890
When we need to predict the no taken branch, we have a history of just 1,

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.747
so we're using both of these. When we have N equals 4 and

00:02:05.747 --> 00:02:11.220
trying to predict this not taken branch, our history is 0 1 0 1.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.960
When we're trying to predict the taken branch, the history will be 1 0 1 0.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.550
When we're trying to predict the next not taken branch, the history again,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.165
will be 0 1 0 1. So as you can see, really, we will only be using

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:30.520
entries 0 1 0 1. And 1 0 1 0. So we're still using only two

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.748
of the 16 2-bit counters. If you look at the 8th-bit history,

00:02:37.748 --> 00:02:43.000
the history will just be 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 and 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 here. So

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.370
we will still be using only 2. Of now, 256 2-bit counters.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.570
So, we are now using less than 1% of the counters we have in each entry.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.710
And finally, for this history, you can see the trend here, we will be using

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.150
only two 2-bit counters of more than 65,000 that we have in each entry.
