00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.372
The final thing that I wanted to mention in this overview of

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:10.720
software architecture, is evaluation. It doesn't do you that much good

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.630
to develop this fancy architecture, if it's not the right one. Okay? So,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.550
we need some process by which we can judge the correctness, completeness,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.730
consistency. And other quality aspects of the architecture we've produced.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.998
Because of its, the importance of software architecture on the ultimate

00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:34.160
product being developed, it's key to get it right.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.020
Because if we make a mistake, it's very costly to make a change. So,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.030
some approaches have been developed for dealing with architectural evaluation.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.860
One of those, is architecture review boards. That is, for large systems which

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.000
are developed by multiple teams. Or, maybe systems of systems. Making a change

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.520
can have impacts on various unexpected places in, in the ultimate system. And

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.780
so it's good to have the stakeholders, particularly development stakeholders,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.600
sit down and evaluate the impact of those changes. Some organizations have,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.910
formalized this into a periodic meetings. That review suggested for

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.010
architecture, suggestions for architectural changes. Also some, so,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.210
some evaluation techniques have been developed. Software architecture assessment

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.450
method, or SAAM. I'm going to show you a slide on this. It's, is a relatively

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.860
informal one. More formal one developed at the Software Engineering Institute,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.480
is the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method, or ATAM.
