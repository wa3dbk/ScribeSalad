00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We're going to the seventh and last unit in our debugging course.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In this unit, we're going to do two things--first, we're going to recap the material of the other units

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and we make sure they all fit well together, and second, we're going to explore a few options

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
on what to do to avoid debugging altogether.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Plus, we're going to have a collection of the best bug stories. Enjoy!
