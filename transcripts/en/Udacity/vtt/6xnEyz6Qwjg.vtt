00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.850
We are now at the point to choose the features we want to include in our model,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.890
to identify the cars by their driving pattern.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.100
Remember we have the choice of selecting different distances.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.750
We also cleaned the data.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.030
Now we are going to select features using distances sampled over time.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.640
As we know from previous examples, this can be broken down

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.430
again into several iterations investigating what works best.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.350
We will go through only a few steps to ensure we

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.910
are selecting features that can give us reasonable results.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.160
Let's now head back to our iPython Notebook again.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.700
And, see how we can identify our features.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.240
Take a look at the code in this block.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.330
Here, the get_sampling_intervals method takes the intervals of

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.830
time at which we are collecting the data.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.640
We also divide the seconds by 60 to get our answers in minutes.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.840
The method returns an array named sampling intervals.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.420
Let's run this part of the code.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.960
This part does not give you any output, since this merely defines the method.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.700
In this part of the code, we are simply going to see

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.460
how many different unique driver ID's there are in our data.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.080
Let's run this part of the code again.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.940
You see we get an output of seven.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.000
We have seven different unique drivers driving around in a given patterns.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.870
Our goal is to look at these patterns and

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.080
see if we can distinguish between each driver.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.750
Before we do so.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.260
We want to make sure we have enough data for

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.840
the sampling intervals that we have in the data.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.640
In the next line of code we make an array for

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.820
all the sampling intervals for all the people.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.060
Next we want to make a scatter-plot of all the sampling intervals.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.250
Let's first make the plot and then we will see what the plot is showing us.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.280
Again, use the play button to run that piece of code.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.200
If everything goes well.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.990
You would get a plot that looks like this.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.040
Let's take some time to investigate what this plot is showing us.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.010
In the x axis we actually have the index of all the data points in our array.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.750
In the y axis we are plotting the inter-sampling time now calculated in minutes.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.155
So what this means is there are some data points that have

00:02:43.155 --> 00:02:47.410
inter-sampling times that are quite high in time.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.310
In this case 750 minutes.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.590
In this case around 800 minutes.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.210
However, notice most of the points have very short intersampling times.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.030
In fact if we take about 60 minutes as our

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.530
intersampling time we will capture most of the data.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.850
When building your features it is important to make sure

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.860
that after selecting the features, you have enough data to do your analysis.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.568
So, by looking at the data, we concluded that a 60 minute or

00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:29.320
one hour inter-sampling time will leave us with enough data.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.750
This is an important point.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.130
Whenever we have a time series data.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.260
It is important to know at what intervals we are making these measurements.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.840
Now we come to another question.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.970
How many points or features should we select?

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.630
We have actually 24 choices.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.100
If we take one hour inter-sampling times.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.780
The 24 choices being location at the first hour of the day.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.040
Second hour of the day.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.240
Third hour of the day.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.460
And so on and so forth.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.070
Up to the 24th hour of the day.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.920
Let's say we select four features.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.220
That means we will collect the location of a person at four different

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.149
hours of the day, and use each of these locations as a feature.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.089
Now, another question rises.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.930
Will we have enough data for the chosen features?
