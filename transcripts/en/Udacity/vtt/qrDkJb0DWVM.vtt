00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, how are we going to address this?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're going to introduce a parameter, named epsilon, which tells us the maximum deviation

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
from the correct result as an absolute number and we're going to give it a default value,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
say up to seven digits after the comma is still fine.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, up to you, take this example and set up a suitable post condition in here,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
such that the difference between y² and x is never greater than eps.
