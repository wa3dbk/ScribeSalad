00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.718
Now, let's go ahead and
declare some variables for

00:00:02.718 --> 00:00:05.721
each of the primitive
types that we saw earlier.

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:09.468
So, now we have a couple more variables,
and I've explicitly stated the type for

00:00:09.468 --> 00:00:11.710
each, even though it's
really not necessary.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.300
Except for the case of the float and
the double.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.555
The character would be the same as well.

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:19.026
So, I'll leave that one.

00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:21.870
I'm going to remove all
the other ones really quick.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.410
But the rest of them,
I think Swift will infer just fine, and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.150
we can double check.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.160
So that's in that like we wanted.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.460
That's a string.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.190
And that's a bool.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.980
Now, what about these float and
double types?

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.050
They seem to represent pretty similar
values, they're floating point numbers.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.690
But why would you use
one over the other?

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.530
Well that comes down to
an issue of precision and

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.380
being able to most accurately
represent a floating point number.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.920
Truth be told, computers actually have
a pretty difficult time doing this.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.080
Usually computers even have
special hardware dedicated just to

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.020
floating point numbers.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.810
Typically you'll want to use
double instead of float,

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.750
because it can handle floating point
numbers at a higher precision.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.400
But, double isn't always better.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.160
In cases where speed may be more
important than the accuracy of

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.210
a floating point number,
you may want to choose float instead.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.030
Next let's try changing
a variable's value.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.400
Let's change myJerseyNumber.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.670
Since we've already
declared myJerseyNumber,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.710
we can just change it with
the simple syntax here.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.650
We have the name of the variable,
an equal sign and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.100
then the new value that we want.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.740
So following this change we can see that
my jersey number went from being 5 here

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.390
to 80 here.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.190
And we can keep doing this
as many times as we'd like.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.520
However, when we change
a variables value,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.210
we must insure that the new
value is of the right type.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.840
So in this case,
every single one of these are integers,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.810
so the compiler wouldn't complain.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.390
But let's try something
a little bit different.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.530
In this case, we're going to
try to change myJerseyNumber

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.167
to something would typically
be inferred as a string.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.530
And this is a problem.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.310
We can see that the compiler's
complaining, and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.900
it says we cannot assign a value of
type string to a value of type n

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.120
because myJerseyNumber was declared
as an integer, it specs an integer.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.560
And the reason this is a problem is
because Swift is strongly typed.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.720
Or we might say that Swift is
a strongly typed language.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.410
This means that once a variable's
type has been declared or

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.110
set, it cannot change.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.730
So if we look at where myJerseyNumber is
declared, we know that it's an integer.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.240
And it can't change.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.650
Therefore, it can't be
set to the string here.
