00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The answer is 2/3 or 0.667, 1/3, and 0.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is a mere matter of normalization.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If you add 1/3 and 1/6, there are 2/6 and 1/6. We get 3/6 which is 1/2.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
These two things over here add up to 1/5.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
To make them probabilities, we have to multiply everything by 2,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and we get those numbers of here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What this suggests is by simple logic of the truth table door 1 has no a 2/3 chance of being correct.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Whereas door 2 has only a total of 1/3 probability of being correct.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Door 3, of course, because that's the one that Monty Hall lifted, has 0 chance of being correct.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That's actually a proof. There's an easier version of the proof, which is more intuitive.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It says before you saw the empty curtain

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the chances were 1/3 each.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Once you see the empty curtain, you learn nothing.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The chance of the bet you placed is still 1/3.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Therefore, the chance that the other door must have gone to 2/3.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This is actually correct, but when I read this first, I didn't think it was plausible.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I really had to go through the truth table. Let's now go and program it.
