00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.610
Now that we've graphed this new line, how should we actually use it? Why do they

00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:09.092
want us to do this in the first place? Remember that what we're trying to do in

00:00:09.104 --> 00:00:13.357
the end is find out how much Grant will pay to each of these companies if he

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.892
decides to buy 75 gallons of cleaning solution from them. So should we compare

00:00:17.904 --> 00:00:22.359
the line x equals 75? Should we compare the slope of the line, x equals 75, to

00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:27.206
the slopes of these other three lines, the x intercept of this vertical line, to

00:00:27.218 --> 00:00:31.735
these line's x intercepts? Should we do the same thing with its y intercept

00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:36.398
instead? Or should we find out where this line intersects each of these three

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.758
lines?
