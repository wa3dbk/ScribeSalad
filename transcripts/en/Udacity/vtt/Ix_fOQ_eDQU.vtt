00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.850
Now, we can play the same game, for ever more complex sentences. So,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.920
here I've again, three predicates, A, B and C. And here's a more

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.470
complicated sentence that involves all three of those predicates. A or B, and

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.610
within parentheses, B and, nought C. And we can find the truth values for

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.530
this particular, sentence, given the truth values for the predicates A, B and

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.740
C. Why don't you give it a try and write down the values here?
