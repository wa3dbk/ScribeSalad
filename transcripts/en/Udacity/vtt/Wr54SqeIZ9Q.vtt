00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.469
Here's the state transition diagram for

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.310
a simple non-deterministic
Turing machine.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.860
The machine starts out in Q zero,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.540
and then it can move the head to
the right upon reading a zero or a one.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.770
Or, upon reading a one,
it can transition to state Q one,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.840
again moving the head to the right.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.620
This is the non-deterministic part.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.200
For a given state and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.670
symbol red, there's more than one
possible transition to follow.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.770
In branches where this transition
is followed, the machine

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.870
reads one more zero one and then
expects to hit the end of the input.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.800
Remember that by convention if there's
not transition specified in one of these

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.230
state diagrams, then the machine simply
moves to the reject state and halts.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.790
That keeps the diagrams
from getting cluttered.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.580
My question to you, then, is what
language does this machine recognize?

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.600
Check the appropriate answer.
