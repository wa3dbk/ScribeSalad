00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.220
For developers, if you've already
built an Android app for your phone,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.130
you're just a few enhancements away
from it working on your tv as well.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.400
Let's start with the Creative Vision for
Android TV.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.310
Which will help you understand
the difference between building on

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.740
something like a phone and
building for the TV.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.960
Now, sum this up quickly.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.440
You want to create an experience
that's Casual, Cinematic and Simple.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.280
By Casual we mean that it should
be easy going, TV is not work.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.780
Picture yourself hanging out with your
friends in the living room watching

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.430
a movie, playing a game, or
just listening to some music.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.350
For example, you don't want to have to
pick up the remote every five minutes to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.540
play the next video,
the TV should just handle this for you.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.830
In the Cinematic App,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.790
the interface should just fade away,
putting the content front and center.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.950
Tell your story with pictures and
sound instead of text and menus.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.270
And finally, everything should be so
simple that it feels magical.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.110
Minimize steps, avoid text entry,
just get the user to their content.
