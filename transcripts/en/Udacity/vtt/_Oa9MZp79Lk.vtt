00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.390
Of course, the hard part now is
I do have two different regions.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.110
How do I actually figure
out what scale to look at?

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.500
This looks good for finding an edge
here, doesn't work for this one.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.550
I can keep growing it.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.460
Oh, at this point, it does.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.570
Plus, of course, it's possible,
and a computationally and

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.060
interesting challenge if
I have to do this a lot.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.690
The problem is how do we choose a
corresponding circles for both of them?

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.560
And of course that could be
computationally a challenging task.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.800
We could do brute force search
methods and stuff like that.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.080
But remember there's another
problem associated with it.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.560
Not just the fact that I need to do
this, but the fact is that this,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.570
the region could have other bits
of information that is not there.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.190
So in essence me matching this to this,
I don't have the full picture there.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.110
I just have the full
picture at this point.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.384
So we need to kind of start thinking
about what kind of a match it

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.940
would be also.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.800
Again, if I now start kind of zooming
out of this one let's see what happens.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.950
Of course, all of a sudden it
was only a match at this scale,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.570
not at the other scale when I zoom out.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.959
So again, it's not guaranteed.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.050
I can scale out on this one.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.810
It matches.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.490
But when I scale out,
no this doesn't match anymore.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.560
So basically,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.760
you have to choose the scale of
the best corner and stick with it.
