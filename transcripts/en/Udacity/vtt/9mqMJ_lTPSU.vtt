In preparation for his upcoming glasses expo, Grant needs to figure out how to

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:06.871
ship all of his wipers and the glasses that they're being modeled on.

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:10.306
Unfortunately, he's not going to have the nozzles ready in time but his

00:00:10.318 --> 00:00:13.921
investors are still confident that they'll be plenty of excitement about the

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:17.483
wipers on their own. Grant's just worried about how to get the wipers to the

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:22.875
expo. He's planning on bringing all of his model glasses wipers to the expo in a

00:00:22.887 --> 00:00:27.345
suitcase, but his concern is that the suitcase will be overweight. When his

00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:31.970
suitcase is empty it weighs 7 pounds, and each glasses wiper set, along with its

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:36.305
protective packaging, only weighs 1 half a pound, or 0.5 pounds.

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.739
Can you find a relationship between the number of glasses wiper sets that Grant

00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:45.194
packs and the total weight of his suitcase? Please use x for the number of wiper

00:00:45.206 --> 00:00:46.919
sets and y for the total weight.
