00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, I break these sums into individual sums--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a sum for this guy, a sum for this guy, and a sum for this guy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
That gives me 1/N Σ Xᵢ² minus something, and you pick on the right side,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
times Σ Xᵢ.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What do you think it will be when I break out this term over here--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and individual component in the equation down here.

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Just look at this guy here.
