00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.850
So the seventh and last principle of knowledge based AI agents in CS7637 is that

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.820
the architecture of knowledge based AI agents enables reasoning, learning, and

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.800
memory to support and constrain each other. Instead of building a theory of

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.310
reasoning or problem solving by itself or a theory of learning by itself or

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.380
a theory of memory by itself, we are trying to build unified theories,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.770
theories where reasoning, learning, and memory coexist. Memory stores and

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.280
organizes knowledge. Learning acquires knowledge. Reasoning uses knowledge.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.980
Knowledge is the glue between these three. One place that we saw reasoning,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.380
learning, and memory coming together very well was in production systems.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.890
When reasoning failed, an impasse was reached then. Memory provided

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.580
some episodic knowledge and a learning mechanism of chunking extracted a rule

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.830
from that episodic knowledge. And that rule broke the impulse and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.400
reasoning could proceed a pace. This is a clear example where reasoning,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.180
learning, and memory came together in a unified architecture. In logic,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.160
memory, or the knowledge base, may begin with a set of axioms.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.520
And those set of axioms decide what we can prove using that particular logic.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.120
To look at the problem, conversely, depending upon the reasoning,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.450
we need to put into the knowledge base, so that the reasoning can be supported.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.900
Exploration of this learning was under the place. Where reasoning learning and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.460
memory came together so well. Memory supplied us with the earlier precedents.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.560
Reasoning led to the composition of this explanation which explained why this

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.430
instance was an example of a cup. This lead to learning

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.900
about the connections between this weirdest precedence to an explanation.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.170
Here in the correcting mistakes was yet another example of, learning, reasoning,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.710
and memory coming together. Where a failure occurred, when the agent used it's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.530
previous knowledge, memory, to reason and identify the fault responsible for

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.600
the failure, reasoning, and then corrected that particular fault,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.940
learning, in order to get the correct model. This knowledge based paradigm says

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.120
that we want to be able to reach unified, that connect reasoning, learning and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.120
memory. And this also connects very well with human cognition, human cognition,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.630
of course, has reasoning and learning and memory intertwined together. It is not

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.490
as if memory and human cognition works by itself or learning works by itself or

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.220
reasoning works by itself. You cannot divorce them from each other.
