00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.611
The vertex of the equation y plus 3 equals the quantity x minus two squared is

00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:09.340
that two comma negative 3, this point down here. Even though I didn't give you

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.720
the graph, you could figure this out, by thinking about how this graph is

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.394
shifted away from the graph of y equals x squared. Here's a quick hand-drawn

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:23.050
version, not very spectacular I'm sorry, of y equals x squared. Our point of

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.913
reference are our parent problem. Since we already knew that the red curve would

00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:32.442
be just an exact shift of the black curve to the right 2 and down 3. We can pick

00:00:32.442 --> 00:00:37.148
any point on the black curve and find the corresponding point on the red curve.

00:00:37.148 --> 00:00:41.787
We can do this for the vertex, which is originally at 0, 0 on the black curve.

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:46.403
So then if we move it to the right 2, the x coordinate becomes 2. And if we move

00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:49.146
it down 3, the y coordinate becomes negative 3.
