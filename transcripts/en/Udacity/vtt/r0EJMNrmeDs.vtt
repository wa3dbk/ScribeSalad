Welcome to lesson three,
where we'll cover bold graphic design.

00:00:03.908 --> 00:00:06.170
&gt;&gt; In lesson two we
talked about surfaces,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.710
kind of like these
sheets of digital paper.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.180
Now, let's go further with the physical
metaphors of material design and

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.220
talk about what appears on that paper,
digital ink.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.470
&gt;&gt; Specifically, we'll be diving into
design elements like space, color, type,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.720
and imagery to make your apps
more beautiful and impactful.
