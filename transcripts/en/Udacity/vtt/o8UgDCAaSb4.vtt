00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.596
Let's discuss the security of DES.

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:09.402
First, we observe that the actual
key value is only 56 bits.

00:00:09.402 --> 00:00:15.034
That means there are only a total
of 2 to the 56 possible keys.

00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:19.973
This key space is too small, because
an attacker can use brute force to

00:00:19.973 --> 00:00:24.924
find the correct key relatively,
easily using today's computers.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:28.994
Another issue with DES is
that the design criteria for

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:31.807
the S-boxes have been kept secret.

00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:36.419
On one hand, they have been shown to
be resistant to attacks that were

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:39.291
published years after DES was published.

00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:42.710
This means that DES is quite secure.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.241
On the other hand, because the design
criteria have been kept a secret,

00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:51.402
one have to wonder what are the designer
of this actually knew about

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:54.541
these attacks years before
they were published.

00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:59.081
One could argue that these design
criteria should have been published, so

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:02.480
the researchers can review them and
improve upon them.
