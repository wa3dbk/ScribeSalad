When you think about it, you know that this call here in your last program

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.262
sometimes showed a question and sometimes a choice question. But actually, in

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:12.359
other programs, this call could even show something else. We could have a third

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.801
class that's also a subclass of questions. Pass it to present question. And

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.750
then its display method would be called.
