00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.884
To find the x intercept, we let y equal 0. If we solve the equation, we notice

00:00:04.884 --> 00:00:09.112
that x is equal to 3. So, the x intercept occurs at 3,0. To find the y

00:00:09.112 --> 00:00:14.104
intercept, we let x equal 0, solving for the variable y, we can see that y would

00:00:14.104 --> 00:00:18.781
equal 2. And, on a graph, we could see that the x intercept would be here and

00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:21.895
the y intercept would be here.There's out line.
