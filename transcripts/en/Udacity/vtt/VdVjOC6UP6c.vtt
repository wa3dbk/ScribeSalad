00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.756
We see from the table that a proportion of 0.2 of the students are from the US.

00:00:04.768 --> 00:00:09.675
And we see that 0.16 of students are from India. Hopefully, you've figured this

00:00:09.687 --> 00:00:14.385
one out. But if not, it's okay. We see that all the European countries are

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:20.064
England, Germany and Sweden. And all the Asian countries are China, India, Japan

00:00:20.076 --> 00:00:28.174
and Pakistan. So, it looks like the total proportion of students from Europe is

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:36.215
0.04 plus 0.06 plus 0.02, so this is 0.12. And the proportion of students from

00:00:36.227 --> 00:00:42.709
Asia is 0.24 plus 0.16 plus 0.16 plus 0.02, this is 0.58. So, it looks like

00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:47.123
there's a greater proportion of students from Asia.
