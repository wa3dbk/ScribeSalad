Now, we might think we have the solutions here to our original equation, but we

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.615
always want to check. When squaring an equation or raising an equation to an

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:14.298
even power, we need to be careful. We don't want to pick up the negative root,

00:00:14.298 --> 00:00:18.475
so we must check our answers in the original equation. So, what I want you to

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:23.073
do is to check negative one and positive 5 in the original equation. What would

00:00:23.073 --> 00:00:26.154
you get on the left hand side? And what would you get on the right hand side

00:00:26.154 --> 00:00:31.263
here? Do the same for this side, and then we'll see the result.
