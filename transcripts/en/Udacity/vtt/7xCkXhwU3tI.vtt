00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.799
So let's have a quiz and a programming exercise on this.

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:04.852
Here, we've given you the code that you just saw.

00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:10.298
Now, what I want you do to is modify the code to time several different scenarios, okay?

00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:15.139
So try running a million threads, each incrementing one of a million elements,

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.434
so every thread is uniquely incrementing a single element,

00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:21.821
a million threads atomically incrementing a million elements,

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:25.602
a million threads incrementing a hundred elements, or a million threads

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:28.732
atomically incrementing a hundred elements, or finally, 10 million threads

00:00:28.732 --> 00:00:30.940
atomically incrementing a hundred elements.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.738
And for each of these choices, I'm going to want you to tell me 2 things.

00:00:33.738 --> 00:00:38.832
First of all, does it give the correct answer? Put a check mark by those that give the correct answer.

00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:42.240
And second of all, rank them from fastest to slowest,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.258
so the fastest will be 1, the slowest will be 5.
