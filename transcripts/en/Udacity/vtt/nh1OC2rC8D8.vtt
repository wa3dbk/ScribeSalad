00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.610
This project begins like
most development projects,

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.930
with a list of new
technologies to learn.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.000
This can be a daunting stage,
but it can be exciting too.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.680
Let's walk through the list.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.778
For the meme editor,

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:14.448
we start out with picking an image
with the UI Image picker controller.

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:21.793
[SOUND] And the next step is editing and

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:26.500
correctly displaying text, moving
the view to accommodate the keyboard.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.499
And sharing the meme
with the activity view.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.441
And for the sent memes pages, you'll
need to set up a tab view controller.

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:46.079
Learn to use collection
view controllers.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.780
And share a single data model
across multiple view controllers.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.260
We recommend that you start out the app
by creating the meme editor, and

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.885
worry about storing
the sent memes later.

00:00:58.885 --> 00:01:01.880
In the upcoming sections will guide you
through the steps to learn these new

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.490
skills.
