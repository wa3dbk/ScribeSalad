00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
But there is more that we can deduce from the code.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Since the character was a less than sign,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we have a condition which specifically checks for less than signs, up here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
However, this condition apparently had not turned out to be true.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Therefore, we can now deduce the value of the quote variable.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What was the value of the quote variable here?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Over to you.
