00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.440
As you can see, we're getting pretty close to our mock up,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.370
but the page looks a little bland.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.710
Of course, we don't have the right colors over here, and

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.700
it also looks like the text isn't formatted quite the same either.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.270
Notice how in the mock up we're right aligned, but

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.970
over here on our site right now we are on the left.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.150
Also notice how this name and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.380
title are both in all caps, while ours are capitalized normally.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.670
Check out Bootstrap's documentation to see if there are any classes that'll help

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.700
you easily fix things like alignment and capitalization.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.500
I recommend checking out the Typography section.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.298
This is a two-part question.

00:00:33.298 --> 00:00:34.340
In the first part,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.570
pick the classes that you need to right-align text and make text all uppercase.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.380
For the second part of this question,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.730
which of these elements need the classes that you've defined up here?

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.310
Div class equal row, div class equals column medium six,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.290
or is it the h1 header and h3 header?

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.000
