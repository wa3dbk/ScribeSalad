00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.320
The Recommendations Row is a central
feature of the Android TV home screen.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.540
You can place recommendations here
to prominently feature content, and

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.480
to enable your users to
effortlessly start playback.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.640
Notice that when the recommendation
part is selected the background image of

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.000
the home screen changes to reflect it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.770
In code,
recs work a lot like notifications.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.300
Basically, you issue a recommendation
by creating a notification.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.630
Cool, right?

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.480
As apps issue notifications, they're
collected by the Notification Manager.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.560
The Leanback Launcher then displays
these notifications as recommendation

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.070
cards in the recommendations row
on the Android TV home screen.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.610
To create a good user experience,
Android TV

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.370
looks at all the available recs and
ranks them using an internal algorithm.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.750
The more often a user picks
one of your recommendations,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.170
the more prominently they'll
be displayed in the future.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.470
Also, it's best practice not
to have more than two or

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.580
three recommendations
active at a single time.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.780
Let's take a look at
how this works in code.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.640
To make issuing recommendations easier,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.219
the Leanback sample provides
the recommendation builder class.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.830
This class uses the builder design
pattern to construct recommendations and

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.640
if you're curious check
out the instructor notes.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.840
You can reuse this in your own code.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.770
Let's take a look at how it works for
completeness.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.060
First we'll issue notifications
using notification compat

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.290
which you saw on the wearables section.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.840
This class is included with
the Android V4 support library.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.480
let's take a look inside the build
method to see how we construct our

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.390
recommendation notification.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.020
Scrolling down a bit you'll see here's
where we start construction our

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.660
notification.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.650
You might be aware that notifications
have four available styles BigPicture,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.020
BigText, Inbox, and Media.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.980
Here we always use BigPicture, so we can
set a background image for the card.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.700
Details on each style are in
the notes in you're curious.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.730
Scrolling down a bit more to indicate
this notification is actually

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.710
a recommendation.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.240
We set a category like this.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.277
We need to set both a Large and
Small icon.

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:56.267
The SmallIcon is drawable resource for
a badge icon on the card, and

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:59.672
the LargeIcon is used as
the card background image.

00:01:59.672 --> 00:02:02.650
We setLocalOnly to true to
indicate this notification is for

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.510
the current device only.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.950
To learn more about the other fields,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.038
check out the link in
the instructor notes.

00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:10.810
Also notice that when
a recommendation card is selected,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.050
the background image of the Android TV
home screen changes to reflect it.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.550
The image we used for
the background image is a large bitmap.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.550
It's too big for a notification.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.390
Instead, we'll use a content
URI to provide its location.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.570
But first, to serve this image,
we'll use a sample content provider and

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.980
implement only its open file method.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.660
We'll do this right inside
the recommendation builder class and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.860
here's how our bare bones
content provider looks.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.982
The only method with
implementation is Open File.

00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:41.090
A ParcelFileDescriptor by the way,

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.170
is used to send a file descriptor
across different file processes.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.780
In this case, from our sample app
to the Leanback Launcher app.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.480
Moving back to the build method,
here's how we get a background image.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.050
Notice by the way that this method is
also called insider content provider

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.070
to resolve the background
image from an ID.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.480
At this point, we can create a content
URI that indicates the background image.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.020
We put this notification
into the bundle using

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.740
the Extra_Background_Image_URI key.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.550
Finally, we'll set a pending
intent to take users straight to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.889
the details fragment when they
select our recommendation.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.190
If you prefer, you can also
jump directly into playback.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.900
To see how this works we'll need to
take a look at another class called

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.170
UpdateRecommendationService.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.070
We'll use this class to keep our
recommendations current by updating

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.850
them from time to time.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.540
And performing small job regularly
sounds like a perfect job for

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.900
an intent service.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.530
We'll actually start this service
when an Android TV boots up and

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.320
we'll see how to do that shortly.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.600
First, let's cover what it does.
