00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.054
Another way of assessing personality is by sitting down with an individual one

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:09.226
on one and answering a series of questions. And these can be about how a person

00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:13.345
behaves differently across different situations. They may ask what the person

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:18.390
was like when they were younger, or how they typically feel on any given day.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.926
Now, usually this is quite comfortable and relaxing for the participant because

00:00:21.926 --> 00:00:25.046
the questions are not limited to true or false, or agree or disagree type

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:30.410
questions. However, we still have a problem with who is going to rate the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.658
answers? And whether or not those are reliable and valid. Now this technique is

00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:39.554
very popular with psychotherapists. Who want to better understand their client

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:44.036
and their client's personality. Therefore, they may ask questions such as have

00:00:44.036 --> 00:00:47.222
you always been anxious or in what situations do you find yourself most

00:00:47.222 --> 00:00:51.872
anxious. But now let's go to Lauren and we're going to discuss projective

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:52.670
tests.
