00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.034
So, extroversion is another dimension of personality. An extroversion involves

00:00:04.034 --> 00:00:08.250
being comfortable with people, being sociable, talkative, outgoing and it also

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.404
involves enjoying risky, thrill seeking kinds of behavior, like driving fast,

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:18.862
downhill skiing and parachuting. On the other end of the spectrum is

00:00:18.862 --> 00:00:23.214
introversion, an introversion involves, shyness, preferring to be alone, or in

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:29.570
small groups of people, and also wanting to avoid high-risk kinds of behaviors.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.384
Now, some people wonder whether shyness is really a necessary part of

00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:39.066
introversion. And let's be clear, the research and theory does suggest that

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:44.340
introverted people really are shy, at least compared to extroverted people.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.672
Now, two important points. Shyness is not shyness all the time. Shy people in

00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:54.531
fact can be very outgoing, and comfortable around people, that they know. And

00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:59.071
secondly, shyness, is also not the same as social anxiety. It's not to be

00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:02.923
confused. Because social anxiety is a much more debilitating, disorder, that

00:01:02.923 --> 00:01:05.560
we'll talk about actually in later lessons.
