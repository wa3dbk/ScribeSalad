00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here's the result code and what we want to do is replace the list tocrawl and crawled with sets.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This make more sense--what we really want these things to be is an ordered collections

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
without duplicates, which is exactly what a set is.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The first thing we need to do is change the initialization.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Instead of starting out with the listed, we need to start it out with the set containing that one only.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
For crawled, we want to start with an empty set.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The good news is we don't actually have to change much of the rest of this code.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Here we're using page not in crawled that in operation behaves similarly for sets as it did for list.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So we can use that just as we were. We don't need to change anything.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
What we want to do is change the part where we used the union and we're going to change this

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to use the set update passing in out links and updating the value of tocrawl

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to be union of tocrawl in outlinks.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We need to make one other change, which is here. We use append which is define for list.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The reason it's not called append for sets is because it doesn't add to the end of a set.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The set has new order, so it makes more sense to call this add,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which is the name of the set up operation that adds an element to the set.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So these are all the changes that we need to make.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The other change that we can make is now we can delete the union code,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
which we no longer need because sets are already defined to provide union..
