00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.620
Remember that components must
have a hyphen in them, so

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.939
let's name the component order-tracker.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.240
While we're here,
let's create the service, too, and

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.080
let's call it order-manager.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.010
The order manager service needs
to keep track of the active day.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.780
We'll have the active
day default to Monday.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.210
The service will also need to manage
the orders that have been placed.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.220
I've created a menu selection object
that will hold the orders for each day.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.930
So this is the data that
the service will need to manage.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.540
Now we need to give it some
way to update this data.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.300
The service needs to be able to
change which is the selected day.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.490
It also needs to add an item
to the selected days meal.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.740
And then it needs to be able to
remove an item from the menu.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.050
Remember that we're extending
the service class with an object.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.260
So inside a function we can directly
access one of the data properties.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.090
Instead we have to use Ember's
this.get to access a property.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.050
Or this.set to change it.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.120
Here we have the order tracker
component and its template file.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.050
We want the template to be
able to use this data, so

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.750
we need to make a connection between
the component and the service.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.870
We use Ember to get the service and
stored in the order manager object.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.800
It's all very readable, we inject
this service into this component and

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.870
refer to it by this name.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.830
Now in the order tracker template we
want our users to know which day they're

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.390
picking food for.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.950
So we reference
the orderManager object and

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.160
then the selectedDay
property off of the service.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.240
Now let's add this component
to the application template.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.940
And while we're here,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.850
let's change the heading to make
it something more exciting.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.360
I had to restart the server on the
terminal for the changes to take effect.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.180
So if you don't see
the data from your service,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.450
make sure to restart the server.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.500
And here's the order tracker
template that's pulling

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.250
the data from the service.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.360
We also want to display the menu item
that's been ordered for each day, so

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.510
let's add that to the template.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.050
We need to display entries for
every meal, so I've added breakfast,

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.760
lunch, and dinner.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.828
We want this information for each day so
we need to loop over the list of days.

00:02:01.828 --> 00:02:07.070
Let's use Ember's each in helper to loop
over the days storing the key as day and

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.680
the days order as menu order.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.310
Let's use these variables
to print out the day and

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.740
the chosen menu item for a meal.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.240
So here we're printing out the day.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.130
And here are the menu items for
breakfast lunch and dinner.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.140
And there we go.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.730
We're showing a meal time for each day.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.660
Now to add a button to each menu item,
so we can select it for

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.740
a specific day and meal.
