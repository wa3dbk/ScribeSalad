00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:06.830
Systems research is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. The only way

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.160
to convince someone of your ideas is to build a system and evaluate it. Now, how

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.930
do you go about evaluating a system such as Spin or ExoKernel? You

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.090
can qualitatively argue that you're achieving extensibility

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.410
without sacrificing safety. Simply by the way

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.980
the system is constructed. But you also have to show that you're not losing

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.793
out on performance, due to the extensability

00:00:33.793 --> 00:00:36.680
hooks. There's an interesting dilemma when you're

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.910
reading research papers. How do you make

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.770
sense out of the quantitative results from

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.670
a data research paper? When you research

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.370
papers, remember that absolute numbers are meaningless.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.200
It is the trends that are meaningful. While doing any performance study of a

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.210
new system that you're proposing, you have

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.140
to identify what the competition is. Remember

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.110
that spin and exokernel were done in the early to mid 90s. For spin

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.030
and exokernel, the competition is a monolithic

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.890
operating system and a microkernel based operating system.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.400
And the competition at that time for both Spin and exokernel was UNIX as

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.950
a monolithic example, and Mach [INAUDIBLE] as

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.820
a micro kernel example. And the performance

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.010
questions always center around space and time. For example,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.810
how much better timewise, is the extended

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.160
kernel, whether it is a spin approach or exokernel approach, compared to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.140
a microkernel-based approach in terms of performance.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.750
And since we know an extended kernel may

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.620
have to incur loss of locality and

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.050
border crossing overhead and so on compared to

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.980
a monolithic kernel, another question that we

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.610
may want to ask is, is the extended kernel

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.199
at least as good as a monolithic kernel? What is the code size of implementing a

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.400
standard operating system, say Unix, as a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.810
monolithic operating system, or a micro kernel based

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.550
operating system or an extended kernel operating system.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.685
So that's a space question. And so, we

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:26.295
can have time questions, as well as space questions when we propose a new way of

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:30.580
doing any particular system component. I encourage you

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.280
to read the performacne results in the papers.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.180
Key take away that you will see when you read the performance results reported

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.940
by both SPIN and exokernel, is that they do much better than Mach, microkernel.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.280
For protected procedure call. That is, when you go from one protection domain to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.270
another, how well are you doing? For

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.460
that, both SPIN and exokernel exceed the performance

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.110
of Mach. And you also see that both SPIN and exokernel

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.410
do as well for dealing with system calls as a monolithic kernel does.
