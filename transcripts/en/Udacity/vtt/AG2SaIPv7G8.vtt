00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.280
To return the average score, I want to calculate the total, and divide by the

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.222
number of scores. I already have a method to calculate the total. I can call

00:00:07.222 --> 00:00:11.296
some scores, and divide by current size. But I'm not sure that this is what I

00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:15.606
want to return. We had that issue before, where if current size was zero, we

00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:20.729
ran into errors. So I'll need to handle that case. If the current size is zero,

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:26.044
I want to return zero, otherwise, it's safe to calculate the actual average. We

00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:30.736
need to actually return the average. Compile. And now, if I enter the scores

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:35.160
that I entered before, I'll get the total, and also the average. But what if I

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.819
wanted to remove the lowest score? We haven't talked about removing items from

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:42.010
a partially filled array, yet. Kai will talk about that, now.
