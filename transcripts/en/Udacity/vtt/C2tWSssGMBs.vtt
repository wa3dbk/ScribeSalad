00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.590
So how the machine behaves is a large collection

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.650
of rules that look like if the variables are set in a certain way,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.200
then this is what happens next.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.130
Now the question is can we use a Boolean formula to express an if-then statement?

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.110
And I will actually let you figure that out in our next quiz.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.460
So I'm going to give you the following Boolean formula,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.570
x1 and x2 and x3.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.280
We're going to do a big not over this

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.960
or x4 and x5 and x6.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.270
And I'm going to give you 4 cases now to look at,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.320
so we're going to look at this part here and this part here,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.510
and I'm not including this big not here,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.620
so I'm just looking at how x1, x2, and x3 evaluates;

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.240
the not is not included.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.840
So there are 2 possibilities of course.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.000
It can be either true, or it can be false,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.780
and those variables over here, completely independent over here,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.330
they can of course also be true and false,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.970
so overall, we have 4 different cases,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.330
and what I would like you to quickly tell me is

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.840
in which of these 4 cases here,

00:01:09.840 --> 99:59:59.000
the whole Boolean formula is satisfied.
