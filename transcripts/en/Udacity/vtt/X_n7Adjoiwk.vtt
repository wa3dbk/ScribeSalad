This orthographic projection isn't normally how we directly perceive the world,

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:06.943
but it's a form we commonly use nonetheless. For example, assembly instructions

00:00:06.943 --> 00:00:10.772
usually show an orthographic view. Architectural plans showing a front, side or

00:00:10.772 --> 00:00:14.652
top view of a building use this sort of projection. You can take measurements

00:00:14.652 --> 00:00:17.568
off of these types of views. Having the distortion caused by perspective

00:00:17.568 --> 00:00:21.580
projection would most likely hinder our understanding of what we're seeing. An

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.060
orthographic camera can be used to examine objects from angles other than

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.680
directly along an axis, such as these views. A demo using an orthographic

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.540
camera follows. I find that I'm so used to seeing with a perspective view that

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.233
I perceive an optical illusion here. If I zoom out using the slider and look at

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:37.775
the whole scene, my visual system tells me that the front edge of the grid is

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:42.178
definitely shorter than the back edge. Try it yourself, and let me know in the

00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:43.409
forums what you think.
