00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.266
If we split 0.001 in half, then we get 0.0005. So that's the probability in

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:13.708
each tail. So if we look at our z table and look for 0.0005, we get about

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:22.700
negative 3.32. So again that means that this z critical value is negative 3.32.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.159
And this z critical value is positive 3.32. Great job calculating those z

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.242
critical values for both one and two tail.
