00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.230
So, bootstrapping is the act of pulling
yourself up by your bootstraps, really.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.070
It's a form of flying, and in business,
what you do with bootstrapping, or

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.080
what it means is, you're going to take
what's immediately available to you.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.160
What's within arm's reach?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.790
What value can you pull out of
the things that are immediately

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.390
accessible to you?

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.880
It does not mean reaching
out to others or

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.810
asking someone to to give you something
that you can then carry forward.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.430
Bootstrapping is about independence,
it's about self value.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.870
It's about creating something that will
allow you to scale your business or

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.890
effort down the road starting
essentially from nothing.
