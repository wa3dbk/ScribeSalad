00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.674
Well, we can convert a slope-intercept form and do it that way. I have negative

00:00:04.674 --> 00:00:09.203
5y in the left and negative 7x plus 3 on the right. Remember, I can't combine

00:00:09.203 --> 00:00:13.878
these because this doesn't have an x, these are not like terms. Next we divide

00:00:13.878 --> 00:00:19.062
every term by negative 5 to get y equals 7 5ths x plus negative 3 5ths.. I have

00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:23.060
a minus sign here, so I know the second term is really just a negative. Our

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.263
equation is in slope-intercept form, so our slope must be 7 5ths. Well done if

00:00:27.263 --> 00:00:31.355
you got that one. If you thought about it in terms of standard form, you would

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:36.131
have done negative A divided by B. You want to be really careful though. This is

00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:40.777
not in standard form. We need to write it in standard form first. The x term

00:00:40.777 --> 00:00:45.428
should come first. I can switch the place of the 7x and the negative 5y and I

00:00:45.428 --> 00:00:49.985
get this equation. Notice, the 7x is still positive and the 5y is still

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:54.660
negative. So A is positive 7 and B is negative 5. A negative divided by a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.355
negative makes a positive, so I get 7 5ths, still the correct answer.
