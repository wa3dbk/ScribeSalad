00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.524
So far, we've discussed the importance of sleep and the purpose of sleep. But

00:00:04.524 --> 00:00:08.431
we still need to address a few of the questions we asked earlier in the lesson.

00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:11.599
Namely, is the brain active during sleep and can we become consciously aware of

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.794
the fact that we are dreaming. There was a time when people thought that the

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:19.865
brain wasn't active or had very little activity while we sleep. However, we now

00:00:19.865 --> 00:00:24.038
know that the brain is actually quite active. In fact, given the advancement in

00:00:24.038 --> 00:00:27.353
technology, namely through EEG machines, we know that the brain goes through

00:00:27.353 --> 00:00:29.670
what we call sleep stages.
