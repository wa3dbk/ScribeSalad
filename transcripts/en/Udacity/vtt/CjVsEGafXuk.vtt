00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.670
To have a tessellated surface made of triangles look smooth, we introduce the

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.786
idea of a shading normal. For a tessellated sphere the geometric normal's for

00:00:08.786 --> 00:00:12.976
the triangles look like this. Each triangle has geometric normal's that are all

00:00:12.976 --> 00:00:17.473
the same along its surface. In other words the triangle's flat. So you get these

00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:22.536
discontinuities at the vertices. Instead of using geometric normals, we can

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:26.866
store a shading normal at each vertex. These shading normals are created by the

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:30.815
application in some way. Sometimes you can get this normal from the underlying

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:34.138
surface. A sphere is a good example, as the normal at a point is always the

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:38.750
direction from the sphere's center. However shading normal is entirely made up.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.804
You can set it however you want. In fact, there are different ways of averaging

00:00:42.804 --> 00:00:46.801
the geometric normals of a triangle that share a vertex. None of these ways is

00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:50.140
perfect, but each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so there's no right

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.548
answer. Shading normals are different from geometric normals. If you're given a

00:00:54.548 --> 00:00:58.343
triangle, you can always get its geometric normal. That's a property that's

00:00:58.343 --> 00:01:00.633
derived from the triangle's points.
