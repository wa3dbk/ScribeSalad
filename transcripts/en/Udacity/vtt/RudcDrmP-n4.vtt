00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now we're ready to define what a perfect cipher is

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and to see why the one-time pad satisfies this property.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The notion that we want a perfect cipher to mean

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is that if an attacker intercepts a message they receive the cipher text

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that provides them with no additional information at all about what the plain text was.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We have a message. It's being encrypted with a key.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The attacker is intercepting that cipher text as it's sent over the insecure channel.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What we want to know is that an attacker who sees just the cipher text

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
learns nothing about the message.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If you followed the definition of conditional probability,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you should be able to decide how to define that formally.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We'll make that a quiz.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The question is which of these is the property that we want in order for a cipher to be perfect?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
That is, to have this property that the cipher text reveals no information about the plain text.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm going to introduce some notation.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Our message is selected from the set of all possible messages.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We have some other message we'll call m&lt;i&gt;, also selected from M.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We don't know if M is equal to m&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Both of these we could think of being drawn from the set of messages.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We have some key drawn from the set of possible keys.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
For this quiz your goal is to understand how we can formally define what a perfect cipher is.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is the scenario: we have an attacker whose heard of cipher text.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We want to know that by hearing just the cipher text the attacker has learned

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
nothing new about the message.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We've introduced some notation here.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We have a set of possible messages--the uppercase M.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We can select lowercase message m&lt;i&gt;. Those are both messages selected from M.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The attacker's goal would be to tell is the intercepted cipher text the same as message m&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That's the attacker's guess.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We have encryption using some key selected from the set of all possible keys.

00:01:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We don't know what the key is. Here are the possible choices.
