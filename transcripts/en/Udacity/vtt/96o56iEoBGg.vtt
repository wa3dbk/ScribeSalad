00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.401
So, here are the two equations that we've come up with so far. One equation for

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:08.821
the amount of money that Grant has left after a given amount of time and another

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:13.105
equation for the total amount of money he spent depending on how many months

00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:17.638
have passed since he's been in business. One thing that we can notice about

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:22.084
these two equations is that money spent is involved in both of them. Now,

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:27.024
remember that what an equation means is that whatever appears on one side of it

00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:32.033
is exactly equal to what appears on the other side. So since we know something

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:36.973
about what money spent is equal to, anywhere we see money spent in any equation

00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:41.857
in the system, we can replace it with what we know it's equal to. Which is this,

00:00:41.857 --> 00:00:46.746
the number of money spent each month times the number of months. So taking this

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:51.168
idea of substituting in values for other things that we know that they're equal

00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:55.414
to. Which answer down here would give us another way of writing out how much

00:00:55.414 --> 00:00:59.693
money we know that Grant has left? I know that this is a lot of writing to have

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:04.226
on the screen at one time, so not a problem at all if this looks confusing. Just

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:06.619
give the quiz a try and we'll see what happens.
