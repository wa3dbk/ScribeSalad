00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.104
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now we can come into our earlier equation and replace ax plus bx with our new

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.282
quantity. Now we can compare a bit more easily. In fact, let's compare these

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:12.236
expressions directly. Let's say for the moment that they're equal to one

00:00:12.236 --> 00:00:16.868
another, so that we can directly compare the coefficients. If this is the case,

00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:21.599
then we must have a plus b equals 5, since these are the corresponding

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.292
coefficients of the x to the first terms. We also know that ab must equal 6. So

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:33.144
you have two numbers a and b that add to give us 5 and multiply to give us 6.

00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:36.234
What do you think those two numbers are?
