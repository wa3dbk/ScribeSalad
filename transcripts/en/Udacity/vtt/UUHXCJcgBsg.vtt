00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.589
It was great to hear Dr Griffiths and Dr Doblin discuss their exciting research

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.648
with psychedelics. It really is fascinating. Now, in this section of the

00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:11.686
lesson, we discuss drugs of abuse and how they produce their psychoactive

00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:16.315
effects. And though we discuss the general classes of drugs, there are many

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:21.054
specific drugs that we didn't get a chance to cover here. So now its times for

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.694
you to head over to the instructor notes section and read the additional

00:00:23.694 --> 00:00:28.122
material that you'll need for this lesson. There we're going to discuss more

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:32.214
drugs, and we're also going to look at the evaluation process for drugs getting

00:00:32.214 --> 00:00:36.736
approved by the FDA. And, finally, we'll finish up with some treatments for

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:39.880
drug dependents, so head on over to the instructor notes section.
