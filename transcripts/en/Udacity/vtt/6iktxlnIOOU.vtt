00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.000
Here is a somewhat more formal definition from the definers of

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.870
the unified software process. I'm not going to recite it for you, but

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.830
I will mention several key elements. One is architecture is all about decisions,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.030
choices that the architect makes about how which, which components are there,

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.100
how they interact, and how the non-functional requirements are being dealt with.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.040
As far as the components are concerned, these are structural elements, and

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.230
they're interfaces, that is what they provide to the rest of the world, and

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.580
what they require from the rest of the world. Components interact, they,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.300
they engage in collaboration with other components, and it is the composition of

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.470
these structural and behavioral elements into larger, and

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.730
larger subsystems that form the overall architecture. This structuring, this,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.910
this composing may be guided by architectural styles, that provide guidance

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.500
as to or bring in experience that others have had with building similar systems.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.130
The decisions about software architecture, concern not only the structure and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.780
behavior but other important elements,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.760
such as usage, performance, comprehensibility, understandability,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.260
economics, technology constraints and trade-offs and aesthetic concerns.
