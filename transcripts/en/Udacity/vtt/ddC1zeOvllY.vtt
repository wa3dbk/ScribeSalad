To find out what c needs to equal to make this equation true, we have to modify

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.952
both sides of the equation so we get c by itself on one side of the equal sign,

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:13.378
and everything else on the other side. Now, to insure that both sides of the

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.175
equation actually remain equal to each other, so that we can legally continue to

00:00:18.187 --> 00:00:22.598
write equal signs in our equation, whatever we do to one side of the equation,

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:26.708
we need to do to the other side as well. If these two things start out having

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.051
the same value, but I, for example, add 4 to the left side and subtract 1 from

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:35.208
the right side, then they can't possible equal to one another anymore, since

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.364
I've changed them in different ways. We'll do plenty of practice with that

00:00:39.376 --> 00:00:43.254
concept in the coming lessons. For now though, let's think about what's

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:47.371
preventing c from being by itself. We know that we want our final equation to

00:00:47.383 --> 00:00:51.647
look like c equals blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, something. So, it means we need

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.671
to isolate c as my petitions like to say. Instead of having just c though, we

00:00:55.683 --> 00:00:59.890
have 92 times c. Remember, there's an invisible multiplication sign right here

00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:04.004
between our coefficient and our variable. We basically need to undo this

00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:08.655
multiplication, get rid of it, and the way to undo multiplication is to do some

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:13.045
division. Since right now, c is being multiplied by 92, to have just c on its

00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:17.485
own, we need to divide by 92. But that also means, since I'm dividing on one

00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:22.821
side of the equation that I also need to divide on the other side. So, I also

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:28.019
need to divide 598 by 92. Looking at the right side, 92c over 92 is, as we

00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:33.647
wished, just c. And on the left side, 598 divided by 92 is equal to the number 6

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.250
and a half. Just to be safe, it's always a good idea to check your answer if you

00:01:39.262 --> 00:01:43.720
know how to. In this case, we can just use substitution. Starting with our

00:01:43.732 --> 00:01:48.227
initial equation, 598 equals 92c, we can plug in our new value for c and see if

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:49.760
this makes a true equation.
