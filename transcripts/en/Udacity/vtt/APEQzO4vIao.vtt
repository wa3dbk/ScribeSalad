00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.195
Here's a chance for you to see what you know. What do you think is the vertex

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:07.164
for each of these parabola's and which direction do you think each parabola

00:00:07.164 --> 00:00:12.679
opens? Enter the vertex here for this parabola and then choose whether it opens

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.865
to the left to the right upward or downward. And if you have trouble with

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:22.906
these, I highly recommend playing around in decimals. Try to create your own

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:26.776
graphs and look for patterns. Maybe just start with some y equals graphs, and

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:31.668
then play around with some x equals graphs, and see how they change. That

00:00:31.668 --> 00:00:34.440
should help you out if you get stuck. Good luck.
