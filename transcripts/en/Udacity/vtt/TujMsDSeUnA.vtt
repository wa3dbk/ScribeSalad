00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.300
We are almost ready to
define the class NP.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.950
First, however, we need to define
running time for a non-deterministic

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.290
machine, because it operates
differently from a deterministic one.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.250
Since we think about these possible
computations running in parallel,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.980
the running time for

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.830
each computation path is the path
length from the initial configuration.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.110
And the running time of
the machine of the whole,

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.380
is the maximum number of steps used
on any branch of the computation.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.272
Note that once we have a bound on the
length of any accepting configuration

00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:35.498
sequence, we can avoid looping
just by creating a time out.

00:00:35.498 --> 00:00:39.925
NP, then, is the set of languages
recognized by an order n to the k

00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:44.610
nondeterministic Turing machine,
where k is some natural number.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.030
Or, in other words, it's the set of
languages recognized in polynomial time

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.410
by a non-deterministic machine.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.188
NP stands for
non-deterministic polynomial time.

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:59.010
Non-determinism can be
a little confusing, but

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.110
it helps to remember that a string
is recognized if it leads to

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.540
any accepting computation, ie,
any accepting path in this tree.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.645
Not that any Turing Machine that is
a polynomial recognizer for a language,

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:16.360
can easily be turned into a polynomial
decider by adding a timeout,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.920
since all accepting computations
are bounded in length by a polynomial.
