00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.460
Domain names are also essential
to several HTTP features,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.420
including cookie security and SSL..

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.020
A single web server can handle requests
from multiple sites which it tells apart

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.730
by their domain names.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.810
Apache calls this a virtual
host configuration.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.610
NGiNX calls it having
multiple server blocks.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.450
No matter what you call it,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.290
it's why your HTTP requests
have a host header in them.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.450
You have to tell that web server what
host name, really what domain name,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.420
you're expecting to talk to.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.350
As you saw earlier in the course,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.900
the host header is a required
part of HTTP requests.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.320
When a web app sets a cookie, it sets
that cookie for a particular domain

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.240
name, and further requests to that
demand will get that cookie sent back.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.240
And SSL encryption certificates
are issued for particular domains.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.110
SSL serves several different
security purposes.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.300
By encrypting the traffic
between browser and

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.120
server, it prevents networks in
the middle from reading private data.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.780
But it also let's the user's browser
verify that the site they're getting

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.340
data from is actually the site that they
expect, that when you go to google.com,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.060
you're actually talking to Google, and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330
not to some bad guy who's
pretending to be Google.
