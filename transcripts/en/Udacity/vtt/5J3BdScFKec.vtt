00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.530
So far we've been pessimistic that we may have

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.130
crashes, but hopefully crashes are not something that happen

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.480
very often. [LAUGH] And if crashes don't happen that

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.380
often, crash recovery is not that important. But on the

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.440
other hand, if crashes are not happening but the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.760
system is progressing along, And what is going to happen

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.310
is that we're going to create lots of log records

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.310
on the disk as the system is making forward progress.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.700
So we have external data segments, which of course

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.610
we need because that is were the persistent objects

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.170
are actually contained, but we are also creating these

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.820
redo log records. There are reflections of changes that we

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.350
made to the in memory versions of these persistent

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.960
data structures. Eventually one of these redo logs that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.570
represent changes to the external data segment to be

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.760
applied to the external data segments. Now the only time

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.970
we're going to do that Is when a crash

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.140
happens, that's being very pessimistic. Also, we may end

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.210
up clogging the disk with a number of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.400
redo log records. We've seen the need for log

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.310
truncation in the distributed shared memory systems as

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.240
well. In the case of DSM, those logs were

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.050
clogging physical memory. In the case LRVM, these logs

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.440
are clogging the disk space. Regardless, these are unnecessary

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.350
overhead in terms of space and clutter, and also,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.480
if a particular application needs to map an external

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.980
data segment, then we have to know whether that

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.900
data segment is up to date or not. And

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.870
that depends on whether or not there are some

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.510
redo logs pending. To be applied to those external

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.330
data segments. So all of these things suggest that

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.420
what we need to do is truncate the log periodically.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.650
What exactly is truncating the log? It means that we want to read the logs from

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.220
the disk and apply them to the external data segments and get rid of them. Now

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.130
this sounds exactly like what I described

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.670
to you happens when we do recovery from

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.560
a crash. Therefore for Log truncation, simply apply

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.610
crash recovery algorithm. So any time the system,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.170
meaning the LRVM run time, decides that it is time

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.160
to do some clean up, what it is going to do

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.600
is it's going to go and pick some logs to clean,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.850
bring those logs into memory Read the redo log records. Apply

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.520
them to the appropriate data segment. And throw away the lock

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.950
record. So that's what lock truncation is all about. Of course

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.730
we don't want to stop the world in order to do

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.070
this lock truncation. So what we want to do we is.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.040
We want to do this lock truncation in

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.790
parallel with forward processing by the application. And

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.950
the way LRVM allows that to happen. Is it splits the log record into Epochs. It

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.360
says this is a portion of the log record that I've chosen the cleanup and this

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.120
is a truncation Epoch, and so this is the part that I'm going to use to read

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.950
from the desk and apply to the external data segment. And in parallel

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.950
with that, I'm going to allow the application to make changes. This is a current

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.440
epoch where the application is making changes to the log record.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.720
And the new record which is not yet being used. So, the idea is that

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.870
we are allowing RVM to do it's work in terms of Log

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.400
truncation by reading a portion of this log

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.360
which is a truncation epoch portion of the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.340
log, and applying to the external data segments.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.330
And in parallel with that, we're also allowing

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.070
the application to make forward progress by writing

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.110
new log records to the current epoch. So

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.950
the crash recovery algorithm is being applied to the part of the log that is in

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.830
this truncation epoch while allowing forward processing to the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.670
part of the log which is the current epoch

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.500
that the server is working on. The biggest challenge

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.400
in implementing LRVM is the log truncation code because there's

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.770
so much coordination that is needed Between what the

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.200
LRV and run time has to do and what

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.280
the application may be doing in terms of morphing

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.030
the current log segment. You need the log segment for

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.779
recovery but it will also overhead when there are

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.870
no crashes. And they take up a lot of

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.830
disc space. And puts extra burden on mapping and

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.600
data segment through the subsystem that wants to use

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.630
it. So, managing the logs, truncating the log as

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.730
efficiently as possible is one of the heaviest problems

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.670
according to the authors of this paper in implementing

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.460
LRVM because it directly has a consequence on the performance

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.670
of LRVM. And in fact the bulk of the heavy lifting that is done in

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.120
implementing LRVM run time and make it really

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.930
lightweight and efficient goes in doing this lock

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.640
truncation efficiently. What I've described to you here,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.740
is one course level of lot truncation where

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.060
We are taking the redo logs and applying

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.220
it. A more finer grained way of implementing

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.420
log truncation would be to look at in memory copy of the log segment also,

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.590
and trying to make sure that we apply it to the external data segments so that

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.140
we don't even incur the cost of writing a disk version of the redo log. That

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.490
is even more complicated and I welcome you to read details of that in the paper.
