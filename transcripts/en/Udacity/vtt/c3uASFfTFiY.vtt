00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.260
Let's add a drop down so

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.110
the user can pick when they
want to eat the menu item.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.470
I've added a dropdown with options for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.990
Now we just need a button.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.350
There we go.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.670
We're now set with all HTML content.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.250
But choosing an item still doesn't make
it appear up in the order tracker.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.000
Let's wire the different
parts of our app together.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.110
Ember controls user
interaction through actions.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.220
The default action is a click.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.200
So adding this action to our
button will listen for a click.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.220
It'll call the chooseItem function and
pass along the item's name.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.360
This function is defined in
the menu items component's file

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.780
inside an actions object.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.580
Let's set up the action and
action handlers.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.660
Clicking the button now calls this
function with the items name.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.530
We need to create this function
in the Component File.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.730
All actions need to be
inside an actions object.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.170
Note that this is actions with an s
while this is action without an s.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.140
the function is called choose item and
it receives the menu name.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.340
When the button is clicked.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.460
The order manager service needs to
be updated with the new selection.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.070
We don't have access to the order
manager in this component yet.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.460
So we just need to inject it.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.550
Now have access to the order
manager service under this name

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.930
to update the service when the bun is
clicked, we first get the service and

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.240
tell which meal to add the item to.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.645
Remember that this method already exists
on the order manager service object.

00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:23.510
I've hardcoded the default
meal time to breakfast but

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.890
users really should be
able to choose the meal.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.730
I switch things around to use this
property which still defaults to

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.690
breakfast but

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.670
with this set up we can use
the template to update this property.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.360
This adds an action to the select
element that fires on change instead of

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.650
one being clicked.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.160
It calls the change
category function and

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.930
passes along the value
that was selected.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.490
The change category function
just updates this field.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.560
Now we can choose a menu item and
have it show up in the order tracker.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.460
How awesome is that?

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.770
Now we just need a way to let
the user cancel one item and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.350
change the active day.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.360
We'll add both of these to
the order tracker component.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.020
So if a menu item has been picked for

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.390
a meal,
we want to let our users cancel it.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.440
This will check if a menu
item has been picked.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.090
This is just an x symbol that,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.490
when clicked,
will remove this day's breakfast item.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.780
Let's create this action
handler in the component file.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.600
This remove function tells
the order manager service

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.360
to remove the menu option for
the meal time of the past and day.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.570
To let users choose the day
they're adding meals for,

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.940
we'll add an action to this div.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.200
Remember that we're looping
over each day of the week.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.980
So this day will change with each loop.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.200
Clicking this div will call this
action passing along this day.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.800
The set day to function just tells the
service to update the selected day and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.560
we're finished.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.530
Our app displays content handles user
interaction and manages data and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.830
it does all of this instantaneously and
with no patriot precious.
