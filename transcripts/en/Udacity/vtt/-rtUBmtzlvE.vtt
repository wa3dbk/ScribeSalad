We switched to a thing called Thing DB. I think it's still called TDB in the Reddit code.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If you find any code that's called TDB or TDB2, I think,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
this one was the second version of the Thing DB that I wrote at some point,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
this is what it's referring to, instead of having a table that looked like this--a link table

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
with a bunch of different columns on it for different things--we would instead do something like this,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we would have a table that just had a couple of properties on it,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a couple of properties that everything had.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let me see if I can remember these things. Everything has a score, an author, and a date.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There might be a few other fields like ups and downs, kind of encapsulated in the score,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but basically, everything whether it's a link, whether it's a comment,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
whether it's a subreddit, anything has these fixed columns.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's not useful for all of them. It's pretty common enough.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This was called the thing table, and we had a separate table

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that every data type had called the data table, and the data table basically had three columns.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It had the thing ID, which thing are we referring to, and it had a key and a value.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
For a particular data type--for a link, for example--a link might be represented like this,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we'd have an entry in the thing table, it might have a score of 5 and of course it has an ID 1,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
an author of 0, that was my user ID, a date when it was submitted and then it might have a data table.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It may have a bunch of rows in the data table.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It would have 1 row that would be like thing ID 1 equal the URL and another row thing ID 1 title.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So, for every property of a thing that wasn't common across all of the things,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we would have a row in the data table, and these are actually different database tables.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
They could be on different machines. This allowed us to add features much quicker.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Because if we wanted to add a new data type to links,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the new links would start getting that new row.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We wouldn't have to go fiddle around with adding it for all the old links. We could just keep our code.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The difference of the link doesn't have this property

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
pretended it has a default value, and this was really cool.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It also allows us to add all sorts of features without having to get the data types right way in advance.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It also allows us to add all these new data types.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
For example, down the road, we'd add subreddits,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so users can make their own kind of categories--their own Reddits--and that's just a thing.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It made our development process a lot simpler, and I wrote this whole layer

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that would kind of map our Python objects to these data tables.
