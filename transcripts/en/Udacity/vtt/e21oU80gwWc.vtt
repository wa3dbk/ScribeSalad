00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's see if we can modify this to make a vector of length n

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
where I can vary the value of n and get a resulting vector with n elements.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.977
So if n equals 5, we'd get the same result as before,

00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:17.759
but for n equals 10, I should get a vector of length 10,

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.469
each of which would have value zero point one.
