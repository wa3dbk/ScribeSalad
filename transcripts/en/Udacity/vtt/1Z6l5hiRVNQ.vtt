00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.160
The second category of issues is coordination.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.200
Remember that we have heterogeneous distributed application,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.720
multiple things going on at the same time.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.730
And these multiple things have to synchronize across certain actions.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.909
Okay, and how is that going to be provided?

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.911
The two main categories of a synchronization are synchronous applications,

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:26.610
synch, synchronous communications and asynchronous communications.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.009
Synchronous means that when one piece of the application initiates that

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.600
particular message or interaction that it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.480
waits until it gets a reply back, a response back, before continuing.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.710
Often synchronous types of interactions are clocked.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.970
That means that there's some heartbeat or

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.090
some other measure of when it can do certain things.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.670
On the other hand asynchronous communication means the client can continue to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.720
execute after it sent the message and it's notified

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.930
when the response comes back and it can take appropriate steps at that point.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.640
Obviously asynchronous is more general, but writing code for

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.290
dealing with a, asynchronous coordination is a little trickier,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.690
it makes it a little harder to understand.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.910
So once again there's a trade off.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.340
Another question with respect to coordination is, who's in charge here?

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.470
Okay, is it the client or the server?

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.990
You've no doubt seen situations where the server is capable of pushing things

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.710
out to the client such as web pages which you want to update with current events

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.300
or it could be that the client requests information as it pulls from the server.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.190
Deciding how you're going to deal with that is a key design question in any

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.080
distributed application.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.910
It's always the case with such applications that robustness is important.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.680
What this means is that the system can deal with situations where one or

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.950
more of its components goes down.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.360
Think that you send out a message and you don't get any response back.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.010
And the reason that you don't get any response back is that the the piece of

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.620
the application you were dealing with goes down.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.560
How does your part of the application deal with that?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.490
Think for example, if you were user facing you don't want to just wait there and

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.500
leave the user in limbo.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.497
You want to provide perhaps some time map on

00:02:18.497 --> 00:02:24.030
a message acknowledgment and be able to let the user know what went on.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.520
Similar to robustness is availability.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.244
How does the system appear to the user as far as being available?

00:02:31.244 --> 00:02:34.480
Is it 24/7, type application?

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.160
Does it have set maintenance times?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.850
How does it deal with load situations?

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.330
That is, does it get so slow that the user gets frustrated?

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.040
All those kinds of questions.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.110
Persistence we've already mentioned.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.250
In general this means how a server stayed maintained.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.034
One obvious approach is with a data base.

00:02:52.034 --> 00:02:56.299
It might be a file system, but nevertheless the choice has to be made.

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.262
And if you've got multiple clients talking to the system,

00:03:00.262 --> 00:03:03.230
how is that concurrency handled?

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.110
Okay, how does the server part of the application deal with all

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.720
these multiple users?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.830
Related to that is the transaction and

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.140
integrity constraints which we've talked about on the previous issue.
