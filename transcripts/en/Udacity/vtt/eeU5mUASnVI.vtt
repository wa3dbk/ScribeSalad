00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.290
Just want to end a little
bit talking about,

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.250
if you've got this way of recovering
depth, how do you represent depth?

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.090
That is, how do you think about
the representation of it?

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.010
We only actually talked about disparity.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.020
We talked a little bit about
depth images but not too much.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.030
But I want to talk about
just two quick methods here.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.345
One is a depth image and then there's
a slightly more, I use the word nuanced,

00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:24.710
a little more recent notion of
representing depth, namely point clouds.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.670
So depth images as shown here this was
another one of those stereo figures

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.800
from the Middlebury
data stereo dataset and

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.890
this is a ground truth
known depth image, right?

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.970
So you see these rings here?

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.240
Right, well, you see that this one's
darker, and brighter, and brighter.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.740
They're at different depths.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.970
Likewise, this picture here
is this picture there.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.830
It's brighter than this mannequin
back there because it's closer, and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.970
if we had more grayscale resolution,
you would see this would be darker than,

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.540
than, than this area because the nose
is further back from the cheek.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.050
So depth images have some
nice representations.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.710
First of all,
I've got depth everywhere, right?

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.040
I can just go to every pixel and
say what's your depth?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.180
So I've got a full dense
depth representation.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.890
Something that's a little more subtle,
is that a depth image not

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.520
only tell you it's two meters
from here to that table,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.180
it also tells me that between here and
that point is free space.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.320
So it doesn't just represent the
surface, it also represents, by default,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.620
if you will, that there is no stuff
between here and there, right?

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.220
So that putting the point
down there is also declaring

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.900
that the ray from my eyeball
to that point is free.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.750
So it's a representation of both
the surface and of free space.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.645
People don't make nearly enough use of
that fact but it's true and important.

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:55.395
The other thing is often we need to
think about depth discontinuities.

00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:58.395
Well, depth discontinuities
are just edges in the depth image,

00:01:58.395 --> 00:02:02.455
where we have lots of processing for
dealing with images.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.075
There are, of course, disadvantages.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.850
One is that it's very
viewpoint dependent, right?

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.090
I've got this scene geometry but my dept
image is based upon where my camera is.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.530
So if I move over here, I've got
a different depth image, and combining

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.715
them is difficult because they're
in the reference frame of my image.

00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:22.445
They're not in sort of some
natural reference frame

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:24.265
that talks about the object.

00:02:24.265 --> 00:02:26.845
So it doesn't capture
the geometry quite so much and

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:30.515
the other thing is, if I want to think
about reasoning about the geometry,

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:33.765
I kind of need to know
where the camera is,

00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:37.365
with respect to this, in order for
me to talk about where the geometry is.
