00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The answer is 30--as I go to the scatter plot that graphs age versus income,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you'll find that up here is the very first time someone had the maximum wage.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
That specific number occurs 4 times--here, here, here, and here among the older crowds

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
of 35-pluses might made it--my own age isn't even on the diagram anymore.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
But the correct answer would have been 30, and it's really easy to see from the scatterplot.
