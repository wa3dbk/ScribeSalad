Did you get those three slopes right? If you did, great job. For the first

00:00:03.964 --> 00:00:09.818
equation, we have y equals 3x plus 9. This equation is in slope-intercept form.

00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:14.669
For slope-intercept form, we know the equation is y equals mx plus b, where b

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:20.202
is the y intercept and m is the slope. So, we know if the equation is in

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:24.300
slope-intercept form. The coefficient to the x variable is going to be the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.716
slope. So in this case, the slope is equal to 3. The second equation is written

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:35.346
in standard form, 3x plus 2y equals 7. I find, putting the equation in slope

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:38.706
intercept form the easiest way to find the slope of an equation that is in

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:44.664
standard form. It just takes two simple steps. The first step is to subtract 3x

00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:51.319
from both sides. When I subtract 3x from both sides, I get 2y equals negative

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:56.423
3x plus 7. I'm almost in slope intercept form but I have 2y instead of y

00:00:56.423 --> 00:01:03.188
equals. So I have to divide everything through by 2. When I divide everything

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:09.068
through by 2, I get y equals negative 3 over 2 is negative 3 halves x, plus 7

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:15.304
halves. So once again, this equation is in slope-intercept form, so we know the

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:21.450
coefficient of the x variable, which is negative 3 halves, is the slope. So the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.610
slope is negative 3 halves. The third practice problem was just a little bit

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.155
trickier. To get this equation in slope intercept form, I subtract 6x from both

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:38.065
sides and I get negative 3y is equal to negative 6x plus 12. Now, here's where

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:41.818
I have to be careful. I have to divide the whole equation through by negative

00:01:41.818 --> 00:01:46.100
3. This can be a little confusing, but let's just take it one step at a time.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.890
On the left side of the equation, I have negative 3 over negative 3, which of

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.998
course is 1. So that just leaves me with y. When I divide negative 6x by

00:01:53.998 --> 00:02:00.576
negative 3, negative 6 divided by negative 3 is 2x. And then, I have 12 divided

00:02:00.576 --> 00:02:06.318
by negative 3. 12 divided by negative 3 is negative 4. So now we have the

00:02:06.318 --> 00:02:10.410
equation and slope intercept form, and the slope is going to be the coefficient

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.170
of the x variable, which is 2. If you got these answers correct, great job. If

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.270
not, you might want to go back and review the videos on how to find slope from

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.420
the equation of a line.
