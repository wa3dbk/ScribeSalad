00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.522
Okay so we know how to get data into a

00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:04.760
MongoDB collection. And do queries against that collection. Now I

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.630
would like to talk about briefly, is how to remove

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.350
documents from a collection where that's necessary. So the syntax for

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.750
removing documents is actually quite similar to the syntax for

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.020
finding documents. So with find if we want to return all

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.420
the documents in the collection we simply don't express any

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.340
parameters to the find function. The same is true with remove

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.440
if I were to execute this query it would remove

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.140
one by one all of the cities from this collection.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.370
A more efficient way of doing that would simply be

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.320
to call drop which would remove the entire collection and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.500
any meta data associated with it. Such as indexes. Now,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.700
we can also remove individual documents or documents matching particular

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.500
criteria. So, for example, I could remove an individual document

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.400
with the name matching the value "Chicago." So, let me

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:59.030
first do a find and there we see that single city. And now, a remove. And then

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.360
to find again, and sure enough, that city's gone

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.170
from this collection. Now let's look at a query

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.990
that touches more than one document. So in

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.150
this case, what I want to do is identify all

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.700
documents that don't actually have a name. Okay, you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.840
can see there are several returned, in fact 210

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.140
documents in this city's collection may seem odd. Don't actually

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.440
have a name. This is a good example here. We've got

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.210
a country, but no name for the individual city. Same is

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.310
true with the rest of these returned. Now, as part of

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.540
a cleaning pass, for example, we might want to remove all cities

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.510
from this collection after they've been put into the database, all

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.960
cities that don't actually have a value for the name field.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.850
I can do that by sending this same query document to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.010
the remove function. So now, I've removed all of those

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.730
cities that have no name and if I do a

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.380
find again I can see that there are now in

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.490
fact no cites that are missing a name field, so

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.430
the take away here is that remove works in a

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.250
way very similar to find, you can specify the document

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.620
to be removed using a query document that has the

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.880
same syntax and operators available as does the find function.
