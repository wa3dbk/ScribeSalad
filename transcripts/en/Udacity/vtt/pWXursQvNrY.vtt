00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.640
Everything so far has been fairly similar to things that you've already seen.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.940
We have just produced different polynomial functions and rational functions

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.858
through combining functions in different ways. But, now I think we should do

00:00:10.858 --> 00:00:14.503
something totally new. Way back when we first started talking about functions I

00:00:14.503 --> 00:00:18.918
showed you a little visual. I think it looked like this. It was a function

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:23.964
machine that takes an input and spits out an output. For example, we could

00:00:23.964 --> 00:00:27.250
write a function that relates the number of wiper sets that Grant has sold,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.589
let's call it N, to the amount of money he makes in the end, his revenue, which

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:37.023
we'll find using the function R. So, for example, if people spend $15 on a

00:00:37.023 --> 00:00:42.865
wiper set, Then R of N will equal 15N. We can see that this function machine is

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:49.142
taking in N as its input, and spitting out R of N or 15N as its output. Now, if

00:00:49.142 --> 00:00:52.904
Grant is trying to increase his revenue, or increase R, then he obviously wants

00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:58.260
to increase the number of wiper sets that he sells. So how does he do that?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.396
Well, as we saw before, the number of wiper sets that he sells, N, is a

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:05.036
function of the amount of money that he spends on advertising, which I'll call

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:09.890
d. Both revenue and money spent on advertising are going to be measured in

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.896
dollars. So now we have that R is a function of N and N is a function of d. So

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:20.470
how are R and N and d all related to one another? We should be able to then

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.445
draw a function diagram that represents this relationship. Which one of these

00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:30.100
diagrams do you think is correct? Don't worry at all if this seems tricky. This

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.019
is definitely pushing the boundaries of our understanding of functions.
