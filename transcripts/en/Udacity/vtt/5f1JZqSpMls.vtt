00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Back to coverage metrics.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We just talked about statement coverage, which is closely related to line coverage,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but it's a bit more fine-grained,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and now let's talk about what is probably the only other test coverage metric

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that will matter in your day-to-day life unless you go build avionics software.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Branch coverage is a metric where a branch in a code is covered, if it executes both ways.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For example, to get 100% branch coverage for the statement that tests whether x = 0,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
it would be needed to be executed in a state where x was zero

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and also in a state where x was not equal to zero.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And so, in many cases, branch coverage and statement coverage have the same effect.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
For example, if our code only contained if-then-else loops,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the metrics would be equivalent.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
On the other hand for code like this that's missing the else branches they're not quite equivalent.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We can take as inputs to this code x =0 and y is -1.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
These inputs were sufficient to get 100% statement coverage.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
On the other hand, these are not sufficient to get 100% branch coverage.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What happens is these cause the taken branch of the if to be executed but not the else branch.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Then the taken branch of the second if to be executed, but not the else branch.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
There are different ways to score branch coverage, but one way we can do it

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
is there are two ways to take this branch, two ways to take this branch,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
so we could say this is 50% branch coverage.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The other thing we could do, however, it do what our Python module for coverage is going to do,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we could say that both of these branches were partially executed.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That is to say, one of their possibilities was realized during testing.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
No branches were completely missed, and no branches were totally covered.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So, let's go ahead and see how our coverage module tells us this.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Right, so as you see here, I've typed into an editor window the same code that I wrote down

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
by hand on the left part of the slide.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And so we're going to invoke the function foo with x being 0 and y being -1.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Let's see what happens.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We're going run this under the coverage tool,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but this time we're going to give the coverage run command, and argument--branch.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That simply tells it to measure branch coverage instead of just measuring statement coverage.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It's again going to render some HTML as a result,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and if we look at the output, it's going to tell us that out of six statements

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
all six of them were run, and there were zero missing statements.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So, at the statement level, we've achieved 100% coverage.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
On the other hand, at the branch level, we had two branches that were partially executed--

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that is to say, only one of their two possibilities was realized during execution.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Now, if we change this a little bit by calling foo a second time with 0 and -2,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
run the coverage tool again, what we'll see is that the second branch, 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the test of y now is executed both ways.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
On the other hand, the first branch, the one that tests x still is partially executed.
