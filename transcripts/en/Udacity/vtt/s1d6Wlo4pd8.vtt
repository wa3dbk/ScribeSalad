x is the thing that we're multiplying by itself. So, it is the base. And then,

00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:09.440
there are six of them multiplied together, so that is the exponent number.

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.476
Again, the way that you needed to write this on the computer was x, carrot, 6.

00:00:14.585 --> 00:00:18.401
This shows that 6 is being shifted up into the exponent slot.
