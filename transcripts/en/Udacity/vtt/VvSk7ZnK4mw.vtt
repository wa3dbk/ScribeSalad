00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.580
So let's answer our SMT
versus dual-core quiz.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.654
We have a floating-point
intensive thread.

00:00:06.654 --> 00:00:12.950
It's going to use pretty much these two
issue slots and very rarely use these.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.830
And then we have an integer-only thread
that only gets to use these two.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.360
So, with a dual-core processor,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.480
one of the cores really gets to be
2-issue plus maybe a little bit.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.800
Another one gets to be just 2-issue
because it never sees floating-point

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.549
instructions that it needs
to have more than 2-issue.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:37.411
In SMT however,
we would be able to do two

00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:42.980
instructions from this thread and two
instructions from this thread per cycle.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.990
So we will be getting very
similar performance, and

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.400
as we have seen, then this is the more
effective approach because the cost

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.230
that we are getting here,
versus here, is significantly lower.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.440
So we get similar performance for
a almost half the cost here.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.780
Now what will happen, however,
if we didn't have a floating-point

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.400
intensive thread and
instead got two of these?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.600
In that case, the two core is slightly
more cost effective because it gets

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.880
the 2-issue performance in each core for
twice the cost of one core.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.870
Whereas this gets us
the performance of a single core.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.350
because both of these are sharing
the 2-issue slots for

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.220
a cost that is more than one core.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.350
So in that case, this will be
the more cost effective option, so

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.330
as you can see it's not that SMT
always wins over multiple cores,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.260
it's that it depends on exactly what
types of programs we have and exactly

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.030
what's the distribution of issues among
units and how different applications

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.880
are using it So the floating
point intensive, an integer only.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.580
And this type of a split
between issues slots

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.130
is an extreme example that
makes the SMT look really good.
