00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.540
Remember, when I initially started talking about images and

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.090
continuous functions, one of the things I had talked about was how we

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.820
can represent these as height maps.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.280
Turning this, this way, you notice what I was referring to.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.210
See the white stripes are all above, and the black spots are all below.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.170
In essence, you see nice ridges.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.640
And in essence, you can actually tell where the edges would be on that image.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.308
Just showing them as static images here.

00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:32.640
One, two, three.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.410
These are a little hard to see but you can see the ridges I was talking about.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.970
Right?

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.330
Much more visible here.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.150
There is a kind of a black point here.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.729
So in essence, the rapid most change is right here.

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.800
Right? The rapid most change is right at these points here, and this one here.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.280
The gradient directions are this way,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.070
the magnitude is this way, but the edge is going to be, here.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.670
Hopefully like this, we've simply visualizing this.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.120
And again, this is something we've been looking at before.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.940
I'm just connecting the dots.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.950
Just to look at it again,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.400
you could look at the edges and the magnitude vectors here, of course.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.800
This is what we're really computing.
