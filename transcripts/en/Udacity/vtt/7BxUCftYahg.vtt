00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.612
&gt;&gt; And so here's that code in practice, the first thing we do is loop through

00:00:03.612 --> 00:00:07.770
each of the tileSets images, checking the firstgid against the tileIndex. Once

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.989
we find the correct one, we'll break out knowing that i is the proper index.

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:16.539
Once we find this, we can set the pkt.img value to equal the image of the atlas,

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.870
and then we go through and do a little bit of math to determine what the tile

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.625
offset is. Now, recall that the tile index is actually added to the firstgid for

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:30.215
this array. So, 167 as a tile index, is actually atlas with gid1. Tile 166. We

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:34.704
remedy this by actually subtracting the tileIndex from the firstgid, giving us

00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:39.328
localIdx. From there, we can do a little simple math, given the localIdx and the

00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:43.900
numXTiles horizontally for this atlas to give us to give us our x and y indexes.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.386
Once we have the indexes, we can multiply them by the tileSize to give us our px

00:00:48.386 --> 00:00:51.309
and py. Finally, return pkt, and we're good to go.
