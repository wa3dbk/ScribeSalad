Okay, the first tag we're going to learn about is the

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:04.890
b-tag and it looks like this. It's got an opening

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.170
b and a closing b. There's a closing slash. And

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.110
anything that appears inside the b-tag appears bold. So, this is

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.200
b for bold. Pretty simple tag. Let's let's play around

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.400
with this in the HTML editor a little bit. Here

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.220
we are. We got this you know, this plain text

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.820
that we've typed in before. Let's let's make one of these

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.470
words bold. Okay. So, I took the word love and I preceded it

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.230
by, an opening tag and a closing tag. And when we, when we click

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.070
UPDATE here to update this. The word love is now in bold. Pretty simple

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.490
huh? Quiz time. In the box below,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.690
make the words reasonably straightforward appear bold.
