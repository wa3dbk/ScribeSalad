00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.680
So, in fact, it's actually quite easy to illicit false memories in the

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.128
laboratory. This is often done with word list. So, people are presented a list

00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:13.400
of words that they have to recall later on. And often, they remember words that

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.496
were not on the original list, but were associated similar to words that were

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:22.672
on the list. So in fact they've created a false memory, a memory of a word that

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:27.660
wasn't there. So then the question is, why is this important, who should care?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.086
So one reason it's so important to demonstrate the ease of creating false

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:35.838
memories in the laboratory is that it has real world ramifications, especially

00:00:35.838 --> 00:00:43.886
in court cases. Occasionally false memories lead to false accusations. In one

00:00:43.886 --> 00:00:48.164
case, a woman who was raped accused a psychologist by the name of Donald

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:54.062
Thompson of the rape. As it turns out she'd been watching t.v. Right before her

00:00:54.062 --> 00:00:58.210
attack and on TV she was watching Donald Thompson, who in fact was talking

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.939
about, of all things false memories. Now in her mind the association between

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:09.810
the attack and Donald Thompson's face was made. So she made this accusation.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.742
Now as it turns out Donald Thompson, of course, had a great alibi. He could

00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:16.046
prove beyond a shadow of the doubt that he was on TV at the time and was not

00:01:16.046 --> 00:01:22.119
there in committing a crime. Unfortuneately, not everyone who is falsely

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.157
accused has such a alibi. Occassionally, false memories lead to false

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:29.510
accusations and convictions.
