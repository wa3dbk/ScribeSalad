00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.480
Researchers now believe the purpose of REM sleep is to assist the brain in

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.432
growth and development. Do you remember when we previously talked about

00:00:07.432 --> 00:00:12.516
neuroplasticity in other lessons? Well, in infancy, our brains are very plastic

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:16.559
and less plastic in old age. We see this correspond with the amount of REM

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:21.138
sleep we get at these different ages. A fascinating component of REM sleep is

00:00:21.138 --> 00:00:25.710
that this is when we dream. And while we're dreaming, the areas of our brain

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.090
that are responsible for receiving sensory stimulation and responsible for

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.577
controlling and planning our body movements are actually activated. This is why

00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:38.724
we feel like we're running or swimming or even falling while we're dreaming. In

00:00:38.724 --> 00:00:43.088
essence, we feel the dream like it's really happening. Sleep is an adaptive

00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:47.579
response and imperative for healthy functioning, both mentally and physically.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.939
If we don't get enough REM sleep one night, we're going to get more REM sleep

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:56.157
the next night. This is called the rebound effect. This shows us, there's both

00:00:56.157 --> 00:01:00.616
a biological need for sleeping and REM sleep. Now, let's finish up this

00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:03.606
material on sleeping and dreaming with Susan and talk about an area that I find

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:07.817
really fascinating. That's the ability for someone to become consciously aware

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:10.116
while they're dreaming, lucid dreaming.
