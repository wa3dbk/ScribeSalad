00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.380
Here's the transition
function that I used.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.730
I'll write it out piece by piece.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.270
First, we need to move to
the end of the input string.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.250
So we have q0 transition
to itself on 0n1 and

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.200
only move into state q1 when
it encounters a blank symbol.

00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:20.050
Since we rewound to the left after
reading the first blank symbol,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.230
the head now reads the last
symbol of the string.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.630
We overwrite this symbol with a blank,
but we remember what the symbol was by

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.990
going into state q2 if it was a 0,
and then to state q3 if it was a 1.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.350
In both cases, we move to the right.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.042
The next symbol will
necessarily be a blank and

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:42.089
we want to replace it with a 0 or
a 1 as appropriate.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.150
We move the head to the left, and

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.070
then left again to return to the last
symbol of the unshifted string.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.410
Eventually, the whole string
will have been shifted, and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.020
this move will try to move past
the beginning of the tape.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.200
In this case,
the head stays where it is, and

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.820
so we read the blank symbol again.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.971
We use this as a signal to
indicate the machine should halt.

00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:07.620
So we write the dollar sign and
do so in the accepting state.
