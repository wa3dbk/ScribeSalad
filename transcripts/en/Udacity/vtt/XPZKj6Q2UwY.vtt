00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Of these four options, the third and the fourth ones are valid solutions.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The first one doesn't work because an eavesdropper could use Alice's public key

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to decrypt the first part of this message and read the message.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The second one isn't possible because Alice doesn't have Bob's private key.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For the third one, only Bob can decrypt the entire message with his private key

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and then he can use Alice's public key to get the message and verify that it came from Alice.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
For the fourth option, any eavesdropper can reverse the first encryption using Alice's public key,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but cannot decrypt the full message without Bob's private key.

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So both of these will work.
