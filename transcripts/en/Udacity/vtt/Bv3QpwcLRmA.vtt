All right. Parsing States. Over here on the left I've drawn a grammar.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
"S" goes to "a s b". We can loop around here, and we can have a "c" in the middle if we like.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Oh, it's just like balanced parentheses, but with central content.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And our input is "a c b" but we've only seen the "a" and the "c" so far.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'd like to know which parsing states are in chart 2.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Remember, chart 0 is "I haven't seen anything." Chart 1 is, "I've seen just the "a"."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Chart 2 is, "I've seen the "a" and the "c", but I haven't yet seen the "b"."

00:00:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
