And the answer should look something like this. We've got

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.700
an opening paragraph, some text, closing paragraph. That's our line

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.570
one. And then we've got another opening paragraph, line two,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.450
and then the closing paragraph. Not too tricky, I hope.
