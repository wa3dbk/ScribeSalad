00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.680
So far,
we've seen how to hijack requests and

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.350
respond to them differently.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.490
We've even created responses ourselves,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.700
meaning we can respond without
using the network at all.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.110
However, if we want to be able to
load Wittr without using the network,

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.110
we need somewhere to store the HTML,
the CSS, the JavaScript, the images,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.640
the web font.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.330
Thankfully, there is such a place,
the cache API.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.670
The cache API gives us this
caches object on the global.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.780
If I want to create or

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.840
open a cache, I call caches.open
with the name of the cache.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.580
That returns a promise for
a cache of that name.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.940
If i haven't opened a cache of that name
before, it creates one and returns it.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.496
A cache box contains request and
response pairs from any secure origin.

00:00:43.496 --> 00:00:46.440
We can use it to store fonts,
scripts, images, and anything,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.000
really, from both our own origin
as well as elsewhere on the web.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.210
I can add cache items using cache.put
and pass in a request or a URL and

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.920
a response.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.840
Or I can use cache.addAll.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.300
This takes an array of requests or

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.460
URLs, fetches them, and puts the
request-response pairs into the cache.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.890
This operation's atomic.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.695
If any of these fail to cache,
none of them are added.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.660
addAll uses fetch under the hood, so

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.060
bear in mind that requests
will go via the browser cache.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.520
Later, when we want to get something out
of the cache, we can call cache.match,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.970
passing in a request or a URL.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.280
This will return a promise for
a matching response if one is found, or

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.255
null otherwise.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:30.720
caches.match does the same, but

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.640
it tries to find a match in any cache,
starting with the oldest.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.090
So we have somewhere to store our stuff,
but when should we store it?

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.540
Thankfully, there's another service
worker event that helps here.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.620
When a browser runs a service worker for
the first time,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.950
an event is fired within it,
the install event.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.390
The browser won't let this new service
worker take control of pages until its

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.500
install phase is completed, and
we're in control of what that involves.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.070
We use it as an opportunity to get
everything we need from the network and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.780
create a cache for them.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.271
So let's do that for Wittr.

00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:05.751
Over in the service worker file,
I'm going to add a listener for

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:06.620
the install event.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.650
Event.waitUntil let's us signal
the progress of the install.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.430
We pass it a promise.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.490
If and when the promise resolves, the
browser knows the install is complete.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.590
If the promise rejects,
it knows the install failed, and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.300
this service worker should be discarded.
