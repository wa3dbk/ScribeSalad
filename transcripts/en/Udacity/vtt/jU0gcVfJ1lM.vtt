What do you think would happen to a toddler who received little to no

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.417
stimulation? The toddler's brain would be smaller and less active than a

00:00:07.417 --> 00:00:13.272
toddler who receives stimulation. The toddler would have cognitive deficits

00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:18.225
such as lower IQ. The toddler would have social deficits. Check as many or as

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:19.449
few as you would like.
