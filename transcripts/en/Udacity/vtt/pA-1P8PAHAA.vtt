00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here's our program, the assertion included, with our input as before

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and if tag should be set somewhere during the execution of this program,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
then the assertion should fail.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So we press on run and we see--oh, the output is still foo.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The assertion has not failed and this shows that during the execution, tag has never been set to foo.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So the correct answer is the output is still foo.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Since we do not get an exception, we can now reject our hypothesis.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So we know that tag is not being set. Tag is always false. So let's go back to our code.
