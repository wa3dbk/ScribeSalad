Congratulations on
completing this course.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.840
Now is your chance to apply
what you've learned to

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.058
create a game tournament project.

00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:10.570
If you enjoyed learning about relational
databases, then your next step after

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.385
this project is to enroll in
a Full Stack Nanoegree program.

00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:17.925
You will build a complex web application
that makes use of the powerful

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:20.245
relational databases to
persistently store data.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.455
You'll learn how to secure and

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.565
configure your own servers to
host your own applications.

00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:26.455
Your new journey awaits.
