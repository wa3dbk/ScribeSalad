00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.340
So using this, we came up with this
whole description of how to look for

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.650
corner or
responses of corners in an image.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.910
And we looked at this diagram.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.620
And again, basically this is showing
you in the two different eigenvalues,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.770
that if the eigenvalue 1 is larger,
the eigenvalue 2 is smaller.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.350
This is the kind of shape you get.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.800
If both of them are smaller
this is what you get.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.030
If eigenvalue second one is larger,
this is the shape you get.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.090
And of course, when both of them
are larger, this is the shape again.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.080
Of course this is the corner.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.420
So we're looking for mostly corners.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.560
This would be an edge,
this would be an edge, and

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.560
this would just be a thresholded point.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.610
We also looked at details of
how we can actually now just

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.890
if we know the second moment matrix,
we can actually compute all of this

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.086
from the straight from
the second moment matrix.

00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:50.340
And we actually did look at the
determinant of this matrix and trace and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.040
actually just comes after
the simple calculation.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.660
And we use a small weight factor, a
constant to help us do this calculation.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.720
So if you notice here where R, which
basically is giving us this information

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.080
about what is a corner or not,
is only dependent on the eigenvalues

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.900
of the second moment matrix,
making it larger when it's a corner.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.950
Negative with large magnitude for
an edge and small.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.110
The magnitude of the R would be small
and that’s where this region would be.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.910
So again, we can do all of this
without any explicit computations of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.750
the eigenvalues because we know how to
compute the M straight from the image,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.950
by just doing the derivatives and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.180
then using the gradient
computation to help us get there.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.090
Which actually is an efficient way of
doing these kind of things, and again

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.030
this is one of the reasons this kind
of stuff can be done quite efficiently

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.400
in most simple computers.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.670
Again, remember, this was the equation
that now we just have to compute, and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.200
we can actually do this
on a neighborhood with

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.130
just image intensities, and
the derivatives of image intensities.
