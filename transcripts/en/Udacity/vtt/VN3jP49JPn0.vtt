Now that we've had a look at the five qualities that we're going to be

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.926
digging into, let's also look at the architectural styles we're going to

00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:09.400
compare them with, okay?

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.290
In particular, we're going to examine be examining the effect

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.230

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.160
each of these five styles.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.425
The five we will look at are pipe and filter, layered architecture, blackboard,

00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:29.060
object-oriented software architectural style, and implicit invocation.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.640
So first, let's take a minute to recall the features of

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.070
those particular architectural styles.
