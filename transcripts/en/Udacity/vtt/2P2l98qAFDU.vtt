00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.620
This equation will be a parabola that opens downward. Great work if you got it.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.162
We know it's a parabola since we have an x squared term, but just a y term. We

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:14.586
don't have y squared. Because we don't have both x squared and y squared, we

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:19.578
know our shape will be a parabola. To figure out which direction the parabola

00:00:19.578 --> 00:00:23.980
opens, we need to solve for y. So, first I'll subtract 27 from both sides of

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.560
the equation. We subtract 27 here and here, to get this new equation. Now we

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.630
want to divide every term by negative 4 to get y by itself. So, dividing this

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.787
by negative 4, we get y. Dividing this by negative 4, we get positive 27

00:00:40.787 --> 00:00:45.003
divided by 4 and dividing this by negative 4 we get negative three fourths x

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:50.714
squared. So since this equation is of the form y equals, we know that it's

00:00:50.714 --> 00:00:56.487
going to open up, or it's going to open down. Since the x squared term has a

00:00:56.487 --> 00:01:02.852
negative coefficient, our parabola opens downward. And, just to show you, this

00:01:02.852 --> 00:01:08.074
equation is the one I have shown graphed, this equation is still the same. And

00:01:08.074 --> 00:01:13.981
this one is identical as well. All three equations represent the same parabola

00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:15.881
that opens down.
