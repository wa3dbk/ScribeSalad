00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.059
Half a kilometer and half a kilometer makes 1 full kilometer. I know 3 8ths is

00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:08.000
shorter than half a kilometer, and the same is true for 3 7ths. This would be

00:00:08.012 --> 00:00:12.315
the halfway point for 1 kilometer. So if I add two things that are less then one

00:00:12.327 --> 00:00:16.495
half, I can't get a full kilometer. You must have walked less than 1 kilometer.

00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:19.050
If you chose less than 1 kilometer, nice work.
