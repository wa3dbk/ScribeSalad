00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So we've talked about some probability problems

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that we can handle with simulation--that is,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
choosing using a random number generator,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
some samples, and hoping that they're representative of the problem.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And if you choose enough, you get a close enough representation.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
An alternative strategy is enumeration,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
where we actually go over all the possibilities

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and we can compute an exact probability.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now, some problems are so complex that it would take forever to do that,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but computers are much better at it than people are,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and so it's a powerful strategy.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We'll show you some simple examples, and they can scale up to more complex ones.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So let's imagine all the possible families living in houses,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and these houses have differeing poperties.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This one is colored red and has an Englishman.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This one has a zebra, and so on.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But for now we're only interested in the children that live in those houses,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and, in fact, we're only interested in the houses that have exactly 2 children.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So we're going to not consider some of them,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and consider the other ones that have exactly 2 children,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and then we want to be able to ask questions of them.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And we can ask probability questions.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We're going to constrain ourselves to ask conditional probability questions.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So what is the probability of Event A given Event B?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And an event is just a state of affairs.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So Event B might be the event of the family having exactly 2 children.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And so we've crossed off these houses,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and we're only taking these other ones, and then Event A might be

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the probability of having a boy or a girl.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now, in real life, we could do simulation by going out and polling and asking people.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
In mathematics, we can do enumeration if we make certain assumptions,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and one assumption we can make is that it's exactly 50% probable that you get a boy

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and 50% probable that you get a girl and that one birth

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is independent from another.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So let's address the question.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
What's the probability of having 2 boys given that there is at least 1 boy in the family?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And the universe of possibilities is only the families that have exactly 2 children.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So we could put that here in the condition as well--

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
at least 1 boy and 2 children total.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
What do you think this probability is equal to?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Let's put your answer here and enter it in the form of a fraction.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So if you think it's one-half, put 1 and then 2.

00:02:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you think it's 11-17ths, put 11 and 17.
