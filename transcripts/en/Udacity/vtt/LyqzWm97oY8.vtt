00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.730
In fact, software processes are normally characterized by several phases, what

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.240
we call the software phases, and only one of these phases is

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.970
mainly focused on coding. The other phases are meant to support

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.440
other parts of software development. The first of these phases is called

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.110
requirements engineering and that's the phase in which we talk to

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.640
the customer, to the stakeholders, whoever we are building the software for.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.120
And we try to understand what kind of system we need

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.650
to build. Then we use this information to define our design and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.840
the design is the high-level structure, that then can become more

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.800
and more detailed, of our software system. Once we've defined our

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.180
design we can actually move to the next phase, which is

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.480
the implementation, in which we write code that implements the design which

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.630
we just defined. After implementing the code, we need to verify

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.510
and validate the code. We need to make sure that the code

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.930
behaves as intended. And finally, we need to maintain the code.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.992
And maintenance involves several activities like,

00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:50.980
for example, adding new functionality or

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.568
eliminating bugs from the code or responding to problems that

00:00:54.568 --> 00:00:57.420
were reported from the field after we released the software.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.020
We will look at all of these activities and of

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.670
the software development process in detail, in the rest of the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.610
class. And for each activity, we will look at the

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.460
fundamental principles and how it is done currently. And in

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.780
some cases, we will also look at some advance ways

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.680
to do it. For example, more research approaches for that activity.
