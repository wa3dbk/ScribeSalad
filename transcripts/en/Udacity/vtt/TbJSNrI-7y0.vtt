00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.370
I think we need a Bedroom class to
represent the bedrooms in our house.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.910
Follow along with me.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.620
Like we did before Ctrl-click on
the House folder, go to New File,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.050
choose Cocoa Class, and
we'll call this class Bedroom.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.990
And of course we want
the language to be Objective C.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.090
Okay so now, what should
the properties of our bedroom be?

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.530
I'm going to give it a BOOL to represent
whether or not it has a privateBath.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.780
And I also want to property to represent
which direction the window faces.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.190
I like it when my bedroom window faces
east, so that I can see the morning sun.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.850
What's a good way to
represent a direction?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.930
If this were swift,
we definitely use an enum.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.740
That's what we'll do here too, but
you'll notice that Objective C

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.590
enums are pretty minimalist
compared to Swift enums.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.930
Enum definitions go at
the top of your header file.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.880
The preferred way to create an enum
is using the NS_ENUM macro,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.350
where NSInteger is the enum type and
direction is the enum name.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.440
All enums in Objective C
are of type NSInteger.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.760
Now that we've created our direction
enum, we can add the property

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.810
directionWindowFaces to
our Bedroom class.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.610
And now that our Bedroom class is ready,
let's go back into the House.h file and

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.395
add a couple bedrooms to our house.

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:18.338
[SOUND] What's going on here?

00:01:18.338 --> 00:01:21.580
Unknown type name bedroom.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.680
Okay, even though they're
in the same project,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.720
the house class can't see
the bedroom class right now.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.610
We have to import it at
the top of the file like this.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.760
Looks like that come to the compiler and

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.740
now we can use the bedroom class
from inside of the house class.
