00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So let's go over the answer to this

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
or 1 possible answer together.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're trying to write a program to interpret

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
if-then-else statements,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and the big concept here about control flow is

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that we don't want to execute both the then branch

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and also the else branch.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Instead, we'll have to pick one.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So the first think I'm going to do is evaluate

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the conditional expression in the same

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
environment in the same set of evaluations

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to variables that we currently have.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If it comes out true, I'll want to execute the then statements.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If it comes out false, I'll want to execute the else statements,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and if you like, this if statement is

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the same as one where I checked to see if

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the result of evaluating the expression is equal to true,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but if you have a little experience with propositional logic,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that's actually the same as just checking

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the value of this variable directly.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So if the conditional expression evaluates to true,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I will evaluate all of the statements in the then branch.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In our running example, that was A and B.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In our current environment there haven't been any intervening

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
assignment statements so the value of the variables hasn't changed.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Otherwise, if the value of the conditional

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
expression wasn't true,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
presumably it was false, we'll go over here

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to the else branch, evaluate the else statements

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
in the same environment,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and note that no matter what happens,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
we're either evaluating the then statements

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
or the else statements, but not both,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and that decision is made based on the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
value of the conditional expression, and that's it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
These 4 lines suffice to evaluate

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
an if-then-else statement in java script.
