00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer here is that all 3 statements are actually correct.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.470
So the strongest one is probably this one here,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.040
so if you just happen to show just one

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.100
single NP complete problem to be solvable in polynomial time,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.610
then all NP complete problems

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.670
are solvable in polynomial time on a deterministic RAM,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.400
so on your home computer, basically.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.500
If all NP complete problems are solvable in polynomial time,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200
because they are NP complete

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.100
that also means, of course, that all problems that are an NP

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.980
are solvable in polynomial time.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.350
So this one here is true, as well.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.020
Some problems in NP can be solved in polynomial time, yeah.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.850
We already know that, and actually, that's the weakest of the 3 statements,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.660
so if all problems are solvable in polynomial time,

00:00:44.660 --> 99:59:59.000
yes, some problems are solvable in polynomial time.
