00:00:00.342 --> 00:00:06.230
Using D3, we can create, remove and manipulate DOM nodes programmatically.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.830
let's try to change the background color of the navbar in the audacity player.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.660
First, we need to find some identifier for the navbar.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.070
A shortcut I like to use to finding which DOM element is represented by

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.940
a visual element is to right click and select inspect element.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.010
This is going to bring me to the navbar or a portion of the navbar.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.189
But if you notice here, the selection doesn't extend the width of the window,

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.230
which leads me to believe that we've actually selected a child of

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.040
the navbar that we're looking for.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.200
Going up, we see a header tag, and when we hover,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.900
spans the full width of the window and has classes defined on it.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.250
Which might mean that we can select it by using the D3 select function,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.770
since the header is actually a header tag,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.720
we can be more specific in our CSS query and look for a header tag

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.450
with class navbar-static-top, which returned is another one of these D3 arrays.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.084
If we open it up, we see its actually the header element we want and

00:01:09.084 --> 00:01:13.822
again hovering over it in the console highlights it in the window.

00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:16.002
In order to manipulate the selection,

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:18.990
D3 defines a set of transformation functions.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.040
To change any of the CSS styling, we call the .style method on the D3 selection.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.700
The first argument to style being the CSS property we'd like to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.500
change or return.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.450
If we don't pass a second argument to .style and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.870
many of the other D3 transformation functions work the same way.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.370
This actually accesses the appropriate style,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.820
in this case background color, and returns it to us.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.490
As you can see here, the D3 syntax says,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.200
using D3 select a header with class navbar-static-top and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.280
return to me the background color styling defined on the header element.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.370
As you can see here, returns a string of RGB values.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.570
If we would actually like to manipulate and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.040
change the background color, we simply need to pass a second argument which will

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.419
replace the current background color.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.340
In this case, as a second argument, I'm simply passing a string,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.090
corresponding to the color I would like to change the background to.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.140
In this case, green.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.670
Two things to note of what just happened.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.880
One, the bar did indeed change to green.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.530
But another strange thing is that the style method actually returned to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.140
me another array that's the same object as returned from select,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.740
corresponding to the navbar.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.750
This is what I mean when I say D3's chainable API.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.510
Most methods defined in D3 return whatever object they were called on.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.925
In this case, D3 select finds and returns a D3 selection object.

00:02:48.925 --> 00:02:54.060
.style mutates that object and then returns the mutated object, and so forth.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.610
So we can call a somewhat arbitrary number of functions.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.080
Chaining one after each other, and D3 knows how to handle it,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.640
changing at each step of the chain the object being passed through.
