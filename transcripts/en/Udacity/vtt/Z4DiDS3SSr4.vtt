00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now we're going to turn our attention to a different type of puzzle.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is called a cryptarithmetic problem.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
"Crypt-" for cryptography--secret writing---and arithmetic for arithmetic--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
doing addition and other types of problems,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and the idea here is that each of these letters of the alphabet stands for

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
some digit from 0 to 9.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The problem is to figure out which digit stands for which

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
such that the equation will be correct.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Some people call these alphametics--is another name for them.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
They're a puzzle for humans to work out because there are so many possibilities,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and humans are limited in the speed in which they can mark them out.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But there are some types of inferences that they can make.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
For example, in this addition problem here we have an addition problem of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
of two 3-digit numbers, and the result is a 4-digit number.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
E is that fourth digit, so what does that tell us about what the letter E must stand for?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What digit it must stand for?

00:01:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Do you think E should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 9?
