00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.800
You take the boat upstream for 10 miles, so we know this should be 10 and then

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.640
when you travel back downstream, you go 15 miles. So, this box should be 15.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.231
Now to find the time of the boat, to travel 10 miles, upstream, we simply take

00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:19.993
the distance and divide it by it's rate. So, we'll have 10 divided by x minus

00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:25.030
5. For downstream, we'll use the same concept for time. We'll take its distance

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.474
divided by its rate. So we'll have 15 divided by x plus 5. Now we have all of

00:00:31.474 --> 00:00:34.432
our information and we want to try and set up an equation in order to try

00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:35.830
solve.
