00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.798
When you wrote your winner and
loser methods,

00:00:02.798 --> 00:00:05.709
you may have gotten an error
reading something like this.

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:11.420
No visible interface for 'RPSTurn'
declares the selector 'defeats'.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.270
Selector here refers to the message or
the method being called.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.830
And interface refers to
the public interface for

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.990
RPSTurn that's found in its header file.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.960
Defeats is not visible to the winner and
loser methods.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.700
Because, just like we saw with
properties, in order for a method to be

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.450
visible outside of its class it must
be included in the header file.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.120
So we'll open up the header file for
RPSturn.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.830
And we'll include
the defeats method here.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.470
Now if we go back to our winner and

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.110
loser methods, we can see that
the compiler error has gone away.
