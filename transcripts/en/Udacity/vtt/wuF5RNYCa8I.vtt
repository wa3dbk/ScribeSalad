00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
That's the mean.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Why is this useful?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The prices I just gave you are really the type house prices you find

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
in the region over here, which is a small section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
where I lived for many years.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You will see they go between $165,000 and $190,000.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
By computing the mean of $174,000,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you can really characterize this section of this neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
When we look over here, we find most house prices are actually a little bit cheaper--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
125, 148, 110, 160--but there are two outliers.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
One is 325K, but the big one is the one over here: 2.4 million.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So do me a favor and compute the mean for this section of town over here.

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And remember, 2.4 million is the same as 2,400K.
