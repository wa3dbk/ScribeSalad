00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
So, how does it work for startup weekend next.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.809
Well, after the weekend, it seems that you're told

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:07.359
that you're going to be presenting your results tomorrow

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.790
and the types of things we want to see is how big is this idea.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.940
So, you have to understand that this is a note for the facilitators and coaches

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.780
Is while the business model canvass talks a lot about the business

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.550
the big idea and you need to note this.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.930
The big idea is that there's thing external to the canvass that are important for a start-up.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.770
It doesn't talk about competition. It doesn't talk about market size.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.760
All of these external forces you need to be asking the team to present as well

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.420
and be constantly thinking about it.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.880
Market size, we'll what kind of interest is this.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.830
Is this is a large scalable opportunity or is it a hobby?

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.250
Or is it like a lifestyle business?

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.690
Now, those teams might decide that making 300 grand a year is just fine, thank you very much

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.720
but they ought to understand that they can never raise venture capital or even investment

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.240
and that it's a nice lifestyle business.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.640
There's nothing wrong with that once you understand that that's the game you're in,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.170
but you need to teach them the distinction between a scalable business and one that's a small business

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.650
Same for competition. Competition is not on the canvass.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.469
They need to understand the external environment and they need to come in.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.040
Understanding the proposed experiments to test each one of the segments

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.660
for customer segments, value proposition channel, and revenue model

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.850
and they want to know what the past fail signal is for each test

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.880
and more importantly you want these teams to hit the ground running

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.059
and so they need to come in with a 100 plus contacts

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:39.820
they're going to be calling on in the three weeks that they're in the class.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.790
Where do they get the contact? Welcome to social media.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.050
Friends, family, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.660
And since it's a team, there are multiple members of the team so a 100 contacts really isn't that much

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.270
spread among three or four or five people.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.940
So you need to be able to contact them and they need to be roughly pre-qualified

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.660
So, each week the team will have homework.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.420
You know, watch part of the Udacity lectures.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.450
Fill out the business model canvass.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.780
Talk to 10-15 customers and then talk to your mentor via Skype or Google hangout

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.270
and fill out the Launchpad Central software.
