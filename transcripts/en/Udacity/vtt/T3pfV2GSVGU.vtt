00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.380
So let us now see how the AI agent may go about building an explanation.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.530
Why this particular object is an instance of this cup?

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.670
So this what the robot wants to prove, the object is a cup.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.060
And this what the robot know about the object. Object has a bottom,

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.930
the bottom is flat, the object is made of porcelain and so on and so forth.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.380
So the question then becomes, how might the AI agent embodied in the robot, go

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.130
about using its prior knowledge, in order to be able to build this explanation?

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.780
But another way, what prior knowledge should the AI agent have, so that it can,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.140
in fact, build this explanation?
