00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.418
So, here's the distribution of Klout data and you can see it's bimodal, like the

00:00:05.418 --> 00:00:13.126
chief scientist described. The mean is about here at 37.72. So now, let's say

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:18.418
we're able to take all possible samples of size 35 and calculate the mean for

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:23.421
each one of them. And then, graph this distribution of sample means. So, this

00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:28.100
distribution should be normal, if you remember from previously. What will be the

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.203
mean of this distribution?
