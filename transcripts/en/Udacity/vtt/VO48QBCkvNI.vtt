00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.880
Now let's start discussing shared memory and private caches.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.810
And in order to simplify the discussion what I've

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.750
done is, I'm using the simplest form of the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.120
shared memory machine that I told you about. That is

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.650
an SMP where there's a single system bus that

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.290
connects all these processes to talk to the main

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.710
memory. Now cache that is associated with the CPU

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.770
Serves exactly the same purpose in a multiprocessor like this,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.910
as it does in a uniprocessor. And that is, the CPU,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.030
when it wants to access some memor, memory location, of course, it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.700
is going to go to the cache and see if it

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.780
is there. If it is there, life is good, it can get

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.980
it from the c, from the cache. If it is not

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.730
in the cache, then it has to go to the main memory.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.890
And fetch it from main memory, and put it into the cache

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.030
so it can reuse it later, and that's the purpose that cache

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.440
performs in a uniprocessor. In a multiprocessor,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.770
performs exactly the same function as in

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.100
a uniprocessor. By cacheing data that is

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.710
pulled in or instructions that are pulled

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.050
in from memory into the cache so that CPU can re-use it later. When

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.850
cache in a multiprocessor, associated with each

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.010
of these CPUs performs exactly the same role.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.670
As it does in [UNKNOWN] process. And that is, if the CPU

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.260
goes to main memory, and pulls in some data, it's going to come

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.520
and sit in the cache. So obviously when the CPU is looking

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.070
for something, first it is going to come and look at the cache.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.630
If it is not there, it's going to go to main memory. And

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.060
fetch the data and put it into the cache so that in

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.780
the future the CPU doesn't have to go to the main memory,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.430
but get it from the cache itself. That's the purpose of the cache

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.700
in a uni-processor. Exactly the same purpose a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.430
cache performs in a multiprocessor as well. However

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.540
there's a unique problem with a multiprocessor. The

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.610
fact that there are private caches associated with

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.680
each one of these CPUs, and the memory

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.690
itself is shared across all of these processors.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.110
Let me explain that. Let's say that there's

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.020
a memory location y that is currently in the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.570
private caches of all the processors. Well maybe y

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.660
is a hot memory location so all the processes

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.910
happen to fetch it and therefore it is sitting

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.640
in the private caches of all the processes. Let's say

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.180
that process P1 decides to write to this memory

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.360
location y now y is changed to y prime.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.000
Now what should happen to the value of y

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.110
that is sitting in all the p caches. And clearly,

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.580
you know, in a multiprocessor, a multi-threaded program, there

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.340
could be a shared data structure that is being

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.890
shared with all the processors. And therefore if this

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.800
guy writes to a particular memory location it is possible

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.760
that that same memory location is in the private

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.350
caches of the peers. So this is referred to as

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.100
the cache coherence problem. Now someone has to ensure

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.300
that, if at a little point of time, if process

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.210
of p two or p three or any of these processes that happen to have this

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.070
memory location y, in the private caches decide

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.190
to access it. They should get y prime and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.440
not y. Now who should ensure this consistency?

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.100
Here again there's a partnership between hardware and

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.080
software. In other words, the hardware and software

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.570
have to agree as to what is called the

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.180
memory consistency model. That is, this memory consistency

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.780
model, is a contract between hardware and software

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.020
as to what behavior a programmer can expect,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.990
writing a multi threaded application running on this

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.910
multiprocessor. An analogy that you may be familiar

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.370
with is a contract between hardware and software.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.580
If you just think about a uniprocessor, if

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.850
you think about a uniprocessor. There's a compiler

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.140
writer that knows about the instruction set provided by

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.500
the CPU. And the architect goes and builds a

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.100
CPU, and he has no idea how this instruction

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.910
set is going to be used, but there is an

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.150
expectation that the instruction set, the semantics of that

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.170
instruction set. Is going to be adhered to in the implementation

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.580
of the processor. So that, the compiler writer can

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.920
use that instruction set in order to compile high level

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.470
language programs. Similarly, when you're writing a multithreaded

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.990
application, you need a contract between the software

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.460
and the hardware, as to the behavior of

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.080
the hardware when. Processors are accessing the same

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.480
memory location. And that is what is called

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.050
the memory consistency model. And what we're going

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.920
to do now, is in order to get your creative juices flowing, I'm going to ask you

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.450
a question.
