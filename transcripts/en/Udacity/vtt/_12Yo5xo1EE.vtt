00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.510
Here are the three expressions. Great work if you got each of these correct.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.990
When we multiply bases, we add these exponents together. So x to the a times x

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.415
to the b equals x to the a plus b. And when we raise a power to another power,

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:22.514
we really multiply these exponents. So to the a raised to the power equals x to

00:00:22.514 --> 00:00:27.858
the a times b. And finally, when we divide the same base, we subtract the

00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:34.168
exponents. We have x to the a minus b. Now, keep in mind that the logarithm of

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:38.320
a number is an exponent. So, we know that these properties are going to have

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.708
some sort of relationship with logarithms. Let's look at some examples and

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:43.600
figure it out.
