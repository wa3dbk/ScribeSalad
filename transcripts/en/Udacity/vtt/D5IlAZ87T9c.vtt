00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.570
Okay, so our program is lacking just one more

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.440
thing. Let's say that we want to take a break

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.280
after every two hours of work on the computer.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.200
I can increase the duration of delay from ten seconds

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.770
to two hours. Now remember, the sleep function takes

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.310
in seconds, so this number to the computer is two

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.690
seconds and not two hours. To fix this, I

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.530
can find out the number of seconds in two hours.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.320
And use that instead. Since I'm still testing my program,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.850
I will keep the wait time to a manageable ten seconds.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.450
Okay, so now that we have written our first program,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.238
let's understand where functions like

00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:41.120
webbrowser.open and time.sleep are coming from.
