00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.918
&gt;&gt; let's continue using our knowledge of parallel and perpendicular lines to

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:07.715
solve this problem. I want you to find the equation of a line that passes

00:00:07.715 --> 00:00:11.797
through the point 1,2 and thats a parallel to this line. Before we find that

00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:16.152
equation, let's break it down into smaller steps. Whats the slope of this line,

00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:20.650
3x plus 2y equals 9? And if we want a line that's parallel to it, what must the

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.763
slope of our line be? Put the slopes in these boxes.
