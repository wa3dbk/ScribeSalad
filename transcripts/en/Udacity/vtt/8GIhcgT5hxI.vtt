00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So we just said, in our particular architecture,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that the HTML interpreter is going to call

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the JavaScript interpreter--but not the other way around.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So they're kind of like two pieces to a puzzle that totally fit.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
These fit perfectly with the application of another jigsaw.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I've labeled them as fitting so they fit now.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Recall that we treat JavaScript as a single HTML token.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And the reason for this is that

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
things like (5 &lt; 7) or (a &gt; b)--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
those can appear in JavaScript.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But they would confuse us in HTML

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because we'd think the Less Than and Greater Than were part of tags.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
For example, this is totally Valid JavaScript.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Assuming (a) and (b) are defined somewhere,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
this should either print out True or False.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But if you look at it carefully,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
this (&lt; b) is sort of indistinguishable

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
from the (&lt; b) that might come in legitimate HTML--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
like: (&lt;b&gt; bold).

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So that's why we took all of this text

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and we didn't interpret it in our HTML parser.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Instead, we saved it for later.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Well--now's the time!

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Let me just remind you of how we defined our tokens

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
related to JavaScript.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Here I have our rule for beginning the tokenization of JavaScript.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Remember, these backslashes are Escape sequences.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You should read right over them.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
In some sense, the first character I want to match

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is this Less Than sign--

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but just in case that has special meaning for regular expressions,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm going to put a backslash before it to Escape it

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so that they know I mean exactly this backslash.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Just like over here, I mean exactly this space,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
exactly this double quote, exactly this forward slash,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
exactly this double quote, and exactly this Great Than sign.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So we're requiring JavaScript to start with:

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
&lt;script\ type=*text\/javascript\

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and when it does, we move our lexer

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
into a slightly different world.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And we talked about this before; we just have multiple finite state machines and then--

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
whoop--we're down at the one at the bottom now.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And then down here, I have my rule for ending JavaScript lexing.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We're looking for this,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
but just in case any of these 3 special symbols

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
have special meaning to regular expressions,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I have put the backslash and Escape sequence in front of all of them.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
This is probably not actually necessary,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
but it's what's known as "defensive programming".

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It can't hurt, might help.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I want the token.value to be all of the string data,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
all of the embedded JavaScript code.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm going to use a variable we haven't told you about yet.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It's possible to get the entire input string

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
from the lexer in:

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
(token.lexer.lexdata).

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Don't worry too much; I'm just going to assert that this works.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This is the entire big string,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and I'm going to get it,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
starting at the position we recorded earlier.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Back up here--when we found the javascript(token)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
we wrote down the current lexer position

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and stored it in a little variable we made up

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
called (code_start).

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So let's say 50 characters into the file

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
we started the javascript.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We'll just store that 50 right here in (code_start).

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
That's going to let us pull out,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
starting at Character 50,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
up to where we currently are.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Let's say that there are 100 characters of JavaScript--

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
now we'd be at 150--and I'm subtracting out 9.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Why am I subtracting out 9?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9--

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
it's the size of this ending token.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I don't want this (/script) to be in it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So I've set the value correctly.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I say the type of this token is 'JAVASCRIPT'.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
For accurate debugging information,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
we want to keep track of which line we were on

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
in case we want to report errors later.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Here's a trick: the JavaScript embedded code probably had new lines in it.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I want to make sure that all of those count,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
so I'm going to count up the total number

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
of new lines--or character returns or whatnot--

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
found in the embedded JavaScript code

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and increment my own line count by that amount.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And then we go back and

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
move to the 'INITIAL' state of the lexer

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
where we can get HTML tokens,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
like 'LANGLE', 'LANGLESLASH', 'RANGLE'.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So this is just gathering up the raw string

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
for embedded JavaScript, and storing it as a single HTML token.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
One last important thing to remind you of:

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Note that we stripped off the final \&lt;\/script\&gt; from the end.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And because of the way lexpos works,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
it measures the value after we match the token.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
We actually end up stripping off the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
\&lt;script\ type="text\/javascript\"\

00:04:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
from the beginning as well.
