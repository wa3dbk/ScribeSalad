00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.160
In addition to coding APIs that
are functional and high performing,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.230
documentation should be easy to
navigate, and aesthetically pleasing.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.860
If your documentation looks like
classified ads from a newspaper,

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.060
developers are not going to be
eager to navigate through it.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.450
Let's take a look at Twilio's
documentation for using their API.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.240
Tulio has this overview page, which
easily guides developers to the major

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060
aspects of their API without
getting lost in the documentation.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.550
Some API providers like Udacity, for
instance, use what we call Hello World

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.280
documentation containing boiler plate
code for using their APIs quickly.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.180
Having a section for

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.290
frequently asked questions, like
the Google Maps API, makes it easy for

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.020
developers to quickly get answers
to their most common questions.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.700
In some situations a good FAQ section
can be just as informative as

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.480
the original documentation.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.300
Since it addresses constraints and
common corner cases of a system.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.050
Playgrounds and sand boxes are also
great tool sets many API providers

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.220
are adding to their documentation.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.380
Developers can test out API end points
by executing sample API request

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.500
directly on the providers web site.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.706
When developing your own APIs, consider
taking time to make fun, interactive and

00:01:09.706 --> 00:01:13.990
develop-friendly documentation in order
to gain popularity amongst your users.
