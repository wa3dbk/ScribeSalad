00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.200
Now that we have learned how to specify states in planning,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.125
let us look at how to specify the operators. So consider the operator,

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:12.700
climb-ladder. You might specify the climb-ladder operator, and

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.970
any other operator in general, to a set of preconditions, and post-conditions.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.740
So for the climb-ladder operator, the precondition might be that the robot is on

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.380
the floor and the ladder is dry. Notice that these are being written in

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.261
the language of propositional logic. And the postcondition for

00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:35.160
the climb-ladder operator might be that the robot is on the ladder.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.970
This captures the notion that the robot has climbed the ladder. It was

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.610
earlier on the floor and later it's on the ladder. Several things to note here.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.212
First, by convention the precondition does not have any negative leg holds.

00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:53.300
All the leg holds in the precondition are positive.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.150
Post conditions of operators may have negative leg holds.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.090
Second, the meaning of this pre-condition, and post conditions is that,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.330
these assertions are true in the world before this operator can be applied.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.420
And that these assertions become true in the world after this operator has been

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.800
applied. This captures the syntax of the operator climb-ladder.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.070
The semantics of this operator is that this operator can be applied if and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.690
only if the preconditions of the operator are true in the world.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.160
It cannot be applied if the preconditions are not true in the world
