00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.730
Okay, so what we have seen just now is that basically even the ideal process

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.690
that can execute any number of instructions per cycle. Still has obey raw

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.600
dependencies. Meaning, it still has to wait for results to be produced before

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.340
they can be used by instructions that need those results. And that really

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.360
creates some of the delays that the ideal processor is going to have. And

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.210
that's why the ILP is not 0, it's going to be something larger than 0 even for

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.840
an ideal processor. So let us now look at some instructions. So

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.040
let's say that I1 is producing the value that's being used by I2.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.204
Then I3 is producing the value for I4. And then, I4 produces the value that is

00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:48.360
used for I5. So what is going to be the CPI for this particular program.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.970
Well it's going to be CPI is equal, how many cycles do we need for

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.840
this, for these five instructions? Well here's what's going to happen.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.353
I1 can execute immediately in the first cycle. And so, can I3 because it

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:07.225
doesn't have to wait for anything. So we spend one cycle executing I1 and I3.

00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:13.020
The next cycle I2 can now go. And I4 can also go because I3 is now done.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.395
And then, we still need a third cycle to execute I5 which has to wait for I4.

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:20.950
So we have spent three cycles for five instructions,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.633
which is going to be a CPI of 0.6. So the CPI is still lower than one.

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:31.390
But now it's even larger. And finally,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.157
if we did have this dependence as well. Now we have to do I1 and then I2, and

00:01:36.157 --> 00:01:41.967
then I3, and then I4, and then I5. So then now the CPI with this is going

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:47.120
to be one. Why? Well because we need five cycles to execute five instructions so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.107
the CPA's going to be one. So basically in the program the dependencies, the,

00:01:51.107 --> 00:01:55.556
the raw dependencies are going to determine basically what is the possible CPI.

00:01:55.556 --> 00:01:58.583
Even if the processor can do everything else ideally. Meaning it can fetch

00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:02.258
a number of instructions, it can decode and read registers in any number of,

00:02:02.258 --> 00:02:07.160
instructions. But it simply cannot provide time travel, which is,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.919
which is kind of the only consideration that you really consider in this case.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.230
Is just that we cannot do time travel. Everything else we can do.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.550
We still have a CPI that is somewhere between one and 0. You will

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.260
have a CPI of 0 if a very large number with no dependencies. We have seen that.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.850
We have a CPI of one. If you have any number of instructions that are all

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.710
dependant on the previous instructions, you really can not let anything get by
