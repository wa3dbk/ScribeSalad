[Evans] We're not going to get into the details of how AES works,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but I want to talk a little bit about the main components of it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There are 2 main things that go into AES and go into almost all modern block ciphers.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They all involve XORs--we saw that in the one-time pad--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and they're XORing some round key which is generated by a key schedule,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
some process of generating new keys for each round.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And then what's going into that, there are 2 main operations.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.000
One is shifts, so permuting bits, and there would be a map that would move bits around.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is better than just doing only XORs

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because we're moving data around instead of just XORing and changing it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The other thing that's really important for a cipher to be hard to cryptanalyze

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is to have some nonlinearity, something that is very difficult to analyze

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and mixes up data in a way that is nonlinear.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This is done basically by having lookup tables.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So what's called an S-box is something that takes in 8 bits--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in this case it could have different numbers going in--

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and basically has a lookup table.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So that's going to have 256 entries mapping each set of 8 bits to some other set of 8 bits.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And designing that lookup table is a challenge.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We want the lookups to be as nonlinear as possible

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and make sure there are no patterns in the data in this table.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And so the way AES works is combining shifts and S-boxes with XOR

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
to scramble up the data.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And it's going through multiple rounds,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
so we'll take the outputs of this, put them back through a series of shifts and S-boxes again,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and keep doing that.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The number of rounds depends on the key size.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So for the smallest key, for the 128-bit key, which is the smallest key size for AES,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
we would do 10 rounds going through the cycle, getting the output cipher text for that block.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So the details are definitely more complicated than this, and getting them right is very hard.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
There's lots of great resources that explain AES in detail, though.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
For our purposes we're going to think of it as a black box--

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that we can use encryption in our protocols.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We're going to assume it has the properties that we want it to have

00:02:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and not need to look in more detail at how to actually implement that in a modern cipher.
