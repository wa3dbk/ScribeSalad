00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.050
Okay, so let's look at the solution for

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.460
this part of the quiz. Do we dispatch an instruction in cycle five?

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.090
No we do not. All of these instructions are waiting for

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.380
something to be broadcast. So until we actually broadcast some results, and

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.020
these instructions can capture the values, they will not be able to dispatch.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.530
Both of them are waiting for something. So this should be empty.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.780
Do we write any results? Yes. The instruction in ROB3 is an add.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.470
It began executing in cycle four. It takes one cycle to execute. So

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.810
in cycle five it will write its result. So the correct answer here is ROB3.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.330
This is which instruction writes its result in cycle five.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.048
As a result of this right result. In cycle five, we mark this

00:00:53.048 --> 00:00:58.660
ROB3 entry as done. The value of three is broadcast with the tag of ROB3.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.450
It gets captured here because this instruction is waiting for ROB3. So in fact,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.160
because we can dispatch this instruction in the same cycle, in cycle five.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.210
This subtract does dispatch. So the instruction in ROB5 will dispatch,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.570
and it will begin executing in cycle six. So this is somewhat of a trick

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.760
question because you needed to first figure out that this write result happens,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.810
and as a result of this we enabled the dispatch of this instruction. So

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.210
it's kind of interesting in that in this cycle this instruction has been issued.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.650
Captured a result and dispatched.
