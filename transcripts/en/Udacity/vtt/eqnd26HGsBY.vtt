00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let's say now that you have a problem

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that you know to be an NP such as vertex cover,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and there's basically two ways that you could show this problem to be NP-complete.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The first one is, you could take another NP-complete problem

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and reduce it to your new problem.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
A second way would be to use the definition

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that we just had of NP-completeness

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and show that this problem here can be used

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to solve any other problem that is also solvable in NP,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and by showing, I mean proving.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That is the first way, and the other way would be to

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
just use the definition of NP-completeness that we just looked at,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
so what you could also do is you could show,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or in this way you would have to prove mathematically,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that any problem in NP can be reduced to your problem.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And the emphasis here is on any problem,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
because otherwise, it wouldn't be NP-complete.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And those are the two possible ways you could show NP-completeness.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I will call this here approach number one

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and this one up here approach number two.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now if you look at those two approaches,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
this one here sounds much easier in a way than this one here,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
because here we just have one problem where we have to have a reduction,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and here we have to have any problem.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Not even some problems, not even a million problems, but really any problem.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But there's a little problem with the first approach here,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and I hope you can tell me what that is.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So what could be potential issues with approach number one?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Could it be that this only works for some problems in NP?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Could it be that before we can do approach number one,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we must first have had success with approach

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
number two for at least one problem in NP?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Or could it be that approach number one is not always correct?

00:01:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So please check all of these statements which you believe are true.
