00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.380
So motives are the drive or reason for doing what we do and emotion is the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.614
feeling of good or bad about our experience. So as it turns out emotions can be

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:16.572
motivating and motivations can be emotional. So for instance, when you're happy

00:00:16.572 --> 00:00:20.402
or proud that's telling you you're doing the right thing, keep it up. When

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:24.591
you're afraid, that's telling you, you're in danger, get out of the situation.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:30.933
Or, if you have a really great meal, that brings pleasure, or happiness. And

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.146
then, when you're disgusted, or angry, there's no way for you to be sexually

00:00:34.146 --> 00:00:39.167
aroused. So as you can see from these simple examples, emotion and motivation

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:44.002
can be closely connected to one another. As we'll see later on in the lesson,

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.170
this is often because the brain structures involved in motivation and emotion

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.205
are often nearby. But for now, let's just move on to the question, what is

00:00:51.205 --> 00:00:52.190
emotion?
