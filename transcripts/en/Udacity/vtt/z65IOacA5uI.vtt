00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.540
Now that we've talked about our regions and whether or not our inequality is

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.177
satisfied in each of them. Let's make a table to figure out the value of each of

00:00:07.177 --> 00:00:10.873
the individual factors within each region and how that affects the value of the

00:00:10.873 --> 00:00:14.808
entire quantity that we're interested in, in our inequality. Remember, you don't

00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:18.448
need to actually use the inequality we're talking about in this table itself,

00:00:18.448 --> 00:00:22.907
but I'll write it here just for reference. So in each column think about the

00:00:22.907 --> 00:00:28.303
quantity at the top. Either x minus 4x plus 4, or the product of those two and

00:00:28.303 --> 00:00:33.958
then for each of these intervals or values, this on the left tell me if quantity

00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:39.677
is positive, negative, or 0. So for example If I'm thinking about x minus 4 and

00:00:39.677 --> 00:00:45.269
I let x equal something greater then 4, then x minus 4 is going to be positive.

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.895
So fill in the table just like that.
