00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.670
When the user opens Wittr, we want
to start by showing the latest post

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.740
the device received,
before going to the network.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.420
Then we make the web socket connection,
and

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.720
we start receiving new posts one by one.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.830
When we receive these posts,
we want to display them of course.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.780
But also, we want to add them to the set
of posts we already have stored.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.830
We also want to remove entries that
are too old to be worth keeping.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.250
A database is the best model for this.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.170
It means we can add and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.020
remove individual posts as needed,
iterate over them, and query the data.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.189
The web platform has
a database called index DB and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.600
it's fair to say it has a bit
of a bad reputation, but

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.300
hopefully we can break
through that in this chapter.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.240
And we're not going to touch
our service workers' script for

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.180
a bit, we're going to concentrate on
learning IDB sharpen how it ticks.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.230
Then we'll integrate it into
a whole offline first experience.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.120
If you've used NoSQL databases before,
IDB will seem familiar.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.350
If you've only used relational databases
before, this might seem a little weird.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.040
But if you've never used databases
before, well, that might even help.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.120
As you can come to index DB fresh,
without trying to translate it to

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.620
similar but ultimately different
things you've encountered.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.700
First up,
here's the shape of indexedDB Databases.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.920
With IndexedDB,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.350
you can have multiple databases
with whatever name you give them.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.450
But we're only going to be creating one.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.300
Generally you'll only have
one database per app.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.790
That database contains multiple
objects stores, generally one for

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.910
each kind of thing you want to store.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.180
An object store contains
multiple values.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.860
These can be JavaScript objects,
strings, numbers, dates, or arrays.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.876
Items in the object's store can
have a separate primary key or

00:01:35.876 --> 00:01:38.860
you can assign a property of
the values to be the key.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.160
The key must be unique
within an object store.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.620
It becomes the way to
identify a particular object.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.970
Later you can get, set, add,

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.250
remove, iterate over items in object
stores as part of a transaction.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.350
All read or write operations in
IndexDB must be part of a transaction.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.020
This means that if you
create a transaction for

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.390
a series of steps and one of the actions
fail, none of them are applied.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.910
The state of the database would be
as if none of the steps happened.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.550
You can also create indexes within an
object store, which provides a different

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.380
view of the same data ordered
by particular properties.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.860
The model here is similar to a lot of
databases which makes a lot of sense.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.890
The browser support is good as well
with every major browser supporting it.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.510
So why does IndexDB have
such a bad reputation?

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.670
Unfortunately the API
is a little horrid, and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.950
often creates spaghetti code.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.190
It's all asynchronous which is fine,
but it predates promises.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.460
So it kind of invented its own
event-based promise system

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.720
which creates really confusing code.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.654
Now, I'm a true believer in teaching the
web platform rather than libraries, but

00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:48.820
IDBs APIs is so clumsy,
I'm going to chicken out of doing that.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.350
We're going to use IndexDB Promised.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.220
This is a really small library
that mirrors the IndexDB API but

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.030
uses promises rather than events.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.710
But other than that,
it's the same as IndexedDB.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.650
So anything you learn
using this library,

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.880
you can apply to using
IndexedDB directly.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.570
In fact if you want to spoil
your day really early,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.110
feel free to avoid the library and
write IndexedDB code directly.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.680
But all the examples will
be using the library.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.820
In the next chapter we'll take a look
at how you'd create a real life

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.490
index database in the browser.
