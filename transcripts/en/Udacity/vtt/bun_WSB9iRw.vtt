00:00:00.144 --> 00:00:03.781
Good morning, afternoon, or evening wherever you happen to be.

00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:07.509
This is John, and I'll be presenting Unit 1. So let's get started.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.248
Like a lot of American kids, when I was probably 6 years old I tried to dig a hole to China.

00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:14.082
I know I'm not the only kid who tried this.

00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:17.923
In general, you can probably conclude that American kids are a, ambitious,

00:00:17.923 --> 00:00:20.334
and b, not particularly good at geography,

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:22.017
at least when they're six years old.

00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:24.863
Needless to say I was not successful. Why?

00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:29.194
Besides having the attention span of a gnat, I just couldn't dig a hole fast enough.

00:00:29.194 --> 00:00:32.664
The question I'd like to pose today is how could you dig a hole faster?

00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:37.818
I also meant there's 3 ways I could have gone faster. One, dig faster.

00:00:37.818 --> 00:00:41.572
Instead of, say, removing one shovelful of dirt every 2 seconds

00:00:41.572 --> 00:00:45.246
maybe with a lot of effort I could have removed 1 shovelful every second.

00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:49.349
This certainly would help, but I think we can all agree that there's a limit to this speeding up.

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:53.458
It's not likely I could go ten times as fast no matter how hard I work.

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:56.195
My shovel would probably explode.

00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:58.025
Two: buy a more productive shovel.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:03.153
Let's say a shovel with two or even three blades instead of one. An interesting approach.

00:01:03.153 --> 00:01:05.438
Perhaps a better shovel would make me more productive.

00:01:05.438 --> 00:01:09.608
But again, I think we can agree there's diminishing returns in making shovels better.

00:01:09.608 --> 00:01:13.602
It's not likely I could use a 10- or 20-bladed shovel.

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:16.014
And number 3, hire more diggers.

00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:20.479
I have a younger sister and a brother. Perhaps I could have persuaded them to help me dig faster.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.684
This is probably the approach that would have been most productive overall toward my whole digging project.

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:28.471
Of course, adding more diggers comes with it's own problems.

00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:31.143
How do I manage them? Will they get in each other's way?

00:01:31.143 --> 00:01:34.869
Will more diggers help me dig my hole deeper instead of just wider?

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.363
Well, as you probably figured out I am not just talking about digging holes.

00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:45.129
Each of these three methods for digging holes faster has a parallel in terms of building a faster processor.

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:48.611
When I talk about digging faster I'm actually talking about asking

00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:54.274
our processor should run with the faster clock to spend a shorter amount of time on each step of a 
computation.

00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:59.179
However, in a modern processor turning up clock speed also increases power consumption

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.848
and we're the limit as far as power consumption on a chip.

00:02:02.848 --> 00:02:05.191
When I talk about buying a more productive shovel,

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:10.465
I'm actually talking about asking our processor to do more work on each step, on each clock cycle.

00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:13.242
But like the super shovel, a single processor has also reached

00:02:13.242 --> 00:02:16.379
diminishing returns on how much work it can do per cycle.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.773
To be a little more technical, the most advanced CPUs are at a limit,

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:24.404
as far as how much instruction-level parallelism they can extract per clock cycle.

00:02:24.404 --> 00:02:26.754
And when I talk about hire more diggers,

00:02:26.754 --> 00:02:31.022
I'm referring to parallel computing in a way that we hope to teach you in this class.

00:02:31.022 --> 00:02:36.654
Instead of having one fast digger with an awesome shovel, we're going to have many diggers with many shovels.

00:02:36.654 --> 00:02:40.272
Instead of having one or just a few very powerful processors,

00:02:40.272 --> 00:02:43.971
we're going to have many, many weaker, less powerful processors.
