00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.670
Here is our number in a place value chart. I know that the 1 is really

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:07.871
important, it's in the 10,000,000 spot. So this tells us how big the number is.

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:12.317
The next important number is the 6. 16,000,000 is halfway between 10 million and

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:16.534
20 million. So I'd want to use the 1 and 6 to gauge how big my answer is. Notice

00:00:16.546 --> 00:00:20.524
too that if I add the powers of 10 to my chart, I can see that the 10 millions

00:00:20.536 --> 00:00:24.439
is 10 to the 7th. So this number is on the order of 10 to the 7th. Or at 10

00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:28.758
millionths. The 1 is definitely the most important number, and then 6 would be a

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.457
close second.
