Okay. Next part of the quiz. What I'd

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.170
like you to do is implement this function called

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.580
check secure val. Which takes the string h

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.300
and that's of the format you know, s comma

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.020
hash. Which is you know, the output of

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.480
mixed secure val. And verifies that s equals, or,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.920
or the hash of s equals the hash

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.190
included in, in that response. And otherwise returns none.
