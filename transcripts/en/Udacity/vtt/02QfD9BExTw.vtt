This is a long unit, and I know things are definitely getting tougher.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.221
If you are having trouble I hope you will take advantage of the course forum,

00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:08.611
there is lots of great discussions there with other students in the class,

00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:10.073
as well as the course staff.

00:00:10.073 --> 00:00:11.610
I want to make sure everyone sticks with the class,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.693
so we asked Sergey Brin to explain why you should do that.

00:00:15.304 --> 00:00:18.196
[Sergey Brin - Co-founder, Google] [S. Thrun speaking] So will you entice students

00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:20.781
to stick with the class and complete it? [both chuckle]

00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:25.612
I certainly recommend that you continue with the class

00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:28.521
and go all the way through it to completion

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:36.199
to really make sure that you get a deep first cut at computer science and at programming.
