00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.430
4000 miles is on the x axis, and we're trying to predict how much it will cost

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.630
in US dollars. Our predicted value, y hat, then equals 0.2 times the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:22.450
independent variable in miles, plus 160.13. If we solve that, we get 960.13.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.975
Since this is actually real data, now you actually know if you want to travel

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:31.025
4000 miles, expect to pay about $1000.
