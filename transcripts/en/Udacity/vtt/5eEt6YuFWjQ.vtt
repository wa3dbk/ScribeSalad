00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.573
The solution to this problem is x equals 9 7th. Well, let's see how we got 9

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:08.450
7th. Whenever I see an equation with fractions in it, the first thing that I

00:00:08.462 --> 00:00:12.499
want to do is get rid of the fractions. Because I don't want to have to add,

00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:17.058
subtract, multiply and divide fractions all the way through solving the problem.

00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:21.595
To clear the fractions out of an equation, I look at all the denominators, which

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:26.942
I have 6, 2 and 3. And I have to find the least common denominator, because I

00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:32.377
want to multiply the entire equation through by the least common denominator.

00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:37.696
The least common denominator of 3, 2 and 6 is 6. So, I'm going to multiply the

00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:43.177
entire equation through by 6. I have to multiply 6 by each term that is in the

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:48.403
equation. I'm going to write the steps out here. But once you get comfortable,

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:53.548
you can feel free to skip this step. So, I have 6 times 1 3rd, and 1 3rd is

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.491
being multiplied by 2 x minus 1. On the right side of the equation, I have 6

00:00:58.503 --> 00:01:04.343
times negative 1 half x plus 6 times 7 6th. When I multiply 6 times 1 3rd, I get

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:09.947
6 times 1 3rd is 6 over 3, which gives me 2. And that's going to be multiplied

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:15.444
by 2 x minus 1. On the right side of the equation I have 6 times negative 1 half

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:20.854
x. 6 over 2 is 3, so I have negative 3 x. When I multiply 6 times 7 6th, the 6th

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:26.383
cancel out and I'm left with a 7. Once I clear the fractions from the equation,

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:31.598
I need to distribute wherever needed. Here, I have 2 times 2 x minus 1, so I

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.809
need 2 times 2 x, and I need 2 times negative 1. 2 times 2 x is 4 x, and 2 times

00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:42.050
negative 1 is negative 2. And I just write down the other side of my equation.

00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:46.294
Once I've cleared the grouping symbols and distributed where needed, I would

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:50.588
combine like terms on each side of the equation. However, here, there's only one

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.612
x term and one constant term on the left side, and one x term and one constant

00:01:54.624 --> 00:01:58.804
term on the right side. The next step is to move all my constants to one side of

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:04.655
the equation. We learned that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:10.400
have to do it to the other side of the equation. So, if I add 3 x on this side,

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:16.040
I have to add 3 x on this side. When I add 3 x to both sides, I have 4 x plus 3

00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:21.829
x gives me 7 x minus 2 equals negative 3 x plus 3 x is 0. So, I just have 7. Now

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:26.130
that I have the variable on one side of the equation, I need to move the

00:02:26.142 --> 00:02:30.728
constant to the other side of the equation. When I add 2 to both sides of the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.197
equation, I get 7 x on the left side. Negative 2 plus 2 is zero. And I get 7

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.033
plus 2 which equals 9 on the right side. So, I have 7 x equals 9. The last step

00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:44.763
is to divide both sides of the equation through by the coefficient of the

00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:49.751
variable. The coefficient of the variable is 7, so I divide both sides by 7. 7

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.765
over 7 is 1, so I have x equals 9 7th. Solving an equation with fractions in it

00:02:54.777 --> 00:02:59.837
is a little bit more difficult. But if we simply multiply through by the least

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.655
common denominator, all the fractions dissappear and you're left with a simpler

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:06.892
problem to solve.
