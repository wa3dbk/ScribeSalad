00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.348
If there are five rows: the first, third, and fifth would be odd rows, and the

00:00:04.348 --> 00:00:09.370
second and fourth would be even rows. But how would we generalize this, to

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.642
figure this out let's look at a couple more examples. If the total number of

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:19.725
rows was 6, then even rows would be 3 and odd rows would also be 3. If the

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:25.310
number of rows was 7, then odd rows would be 4 and even rows would still be 3.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.068
So, it looks like the number of odd rows is something like half of the total

00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:37.192
number of rows, but 4 isn't exactly half of 7 over 2. It would be half of 7+1

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:42.541
over 2. What would happen if we added 1 on to this 6 as well. Then we will get

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:48.510
7 over 2, which in Javaland for integers is still 3. For the even rows 6 over 2

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.150
is 3, that one works. And 7 over 2 is pretty close to 3. In Javaland that's 3.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.970
So, if I just divide by 2 and throw away the remainders, it looks like I get

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.467
the numbers of even rows. If you don't believe me, you can try a few more

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:07.515
examples. So, it looks like the total number of odd rows is the total number of

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:13.682
rows plus 1, over 2, and then drop the decimal. Whereas the number of even rows

00:01:13.682 --> 00:01:19.519
is just the total number of rows over 2, and we drop the decimal. There's

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:23.285
another way you could calculate the odd rows. You could say that the odd rows

00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:28.307
are always the total number of rows divided by two and then you add one if the

00:01:28.307 --> 00:01:36.352
total number of rows is odd. So, that would be the total number over 2 plus one

00:01:36.352 --> 00:01:45.758
if 7 is odd. And if 7 is odd then 7 mod two would be one. So, total mod 2. Save

00:01:45.758 --> 00:01:48.769
these for later. And you could also try this one.
