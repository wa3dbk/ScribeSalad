00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.440
So here's a mapping app
that I've already created.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.480
This one is identical to all the others
that you've been using throughout this

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.440
course.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.550
It has a single view and
there's a map fragment on that view.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.040
The Gradle file is set up for
the play-services libraries.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.830
And the manifest file is set up
in the usual way with OpenGL,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.950
with the services libraries, with the
API key, and with the permissions that I

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.530
want to use, internet access network
state and write external storage.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.870
And of course on my
Google Developers Console,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.030
as I showed you earlier on,
I've configured this API for

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.150
access through that API key and
the API key is here.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.380
Now let's take a look
at the main activity.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.180
So in my main activity class I've just
created a number of local variables

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.625
of marker options type and I just named
them after the various rinks, renton,

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:49.300
kirkland, everett, lynnwood,
montlake, kent and showare.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.660
I've also created a camera
position that I called Seattle,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.710
which is just the default
camera position that I'm using

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.220
when the application actually launches.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.740
Then, in my uncreate function,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.050
I called the marker options in the way
that I had demonstrated on the slide.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.050
So, for example, Renton is new
marker options with the latitude and

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.790
longitude of Renton and
the title Renton.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.040
I was able to get the latitudes and
longitudes for each of the rinks

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.230
using the technique that I showed
earlier on just using Google Maps,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.310
dropping a pin and reading
the latitude and longitude from them.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.500
So I've set up all of my marker
options for all of my rinks.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.370
And then in my onMapReady function, so

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.690
remember the onMapReady callback
gets called when the map is ready,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.490
because I've implemented onMapReady
callback in my activity.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.420
So when the onMapReady gets called,
I simply add all the markers to my maps

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.240
so, m map dot add marker Renton and
map dot add marker Kirkland, etcetera.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.408
I add them all and
then I call fly to Seattle.

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:49.320
And the flyTo function is very similar
to the one you saw in the previous

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.940
demo except this time I'm just moving
the camera, I'm not animating it.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.870
So then I'm just going to
fly to Seattle and

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.930
I'm just going to jump
into that location.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.760
I haven't put any flyTo
to the particular rinks.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.740
The only time flyTo has been
called in this application

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.550
is right at the beginning,
when I say flyTo(SEATTLE).

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.008
And the only time that the flyTo
function's called is, of course,

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:10.190
in the on mapReady
when I flyTo(SEATTLE).

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.065
So that would just give me a default
view, looking at Seattle in

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:16.110
the location where we could see
all of the rinks on the same map.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.082
So, I had moved the camera to
the appropriate location to allow me to

00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:22.700
do that, and that was the camera
that was defined as Seattle.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.240
As you can see here,
with the latitude/longitude, zoom of 10,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.460
bearing of 0, so I'm looking straight
down, and a tilt of 45 degrees.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.130
That was pretty simple, right?

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.340
And in the next step here, you're
actually going to build a custom marker,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.520
so you're not going to use
the default marker pen.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.610
You can create your own marker,
for example, a hockey player.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.810
But before we get to that, let's have a
little quiz about using markers on maps.
