If you can think of a way to construct gender, it exists. There are cultures

00:00:05.346 --> 00:00:09.601
across the globe where there are three genders. In Thailand for example, there,

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:14.675
there are three genders. in, in certain Native American groups or indigenous

00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:19.835
groups to the Americas, there are four genders. In parts of China there are

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:25.566
older communities that have five genders. and when we think about that from a

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:31.481
binary gender lands it's almost impossible to wrap our mind around it. until we

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:35.639
start to really realize, we think about our own gender and we think, oh gosh,

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:40.691
some days I feel very masculine. You know, maybe when I'm at work maybe I have

00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:44.402
a job where I'm surrounded by a lot of men. Maybe I do construction yet I

00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:47.741
happen to have a breast and, and vulva, but I don't really feel like a woman in

00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:51.292
that context because I'm not really doing things that are very stereotypically

00:00:51.292 --> 00:00:56.918
feminine. I kind of feel masculine. But then, then when I go home and I have my

00:00:56.918 --> 00:01:02.384
male partner and I have children, I feel very feminine. I, I'm mothering. I

00:01:02.384 --> 00:01:06.448
feel like a woman. And so when we start to think about gender as something that

00:01:06.448 --> 00:01:10.664
is fluid throughout the day as something that varies from place to place on the

00:01:10.664 --> 00:01:16.692
globe. And it's different across time. I mean, the concept of this gender

00:01:16.692 --> 00:01:20.916
binary pink blue society that we have in the United States, for example, really

00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:24.884
didn't really emerge until, you know, the 1900's that, that really is a new

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:31.301
concept. And really with the advent of this pink blue thing, that was like the

00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:35.674
1950's. And so in asking what gender is really we need to ask ourselves what is

00:01:35.674 --> 00:01:38.742
gender to me and what is gender to you and how is that similar and how is it

00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:43.872
different. And we really should be mindful not to make assumptions, which is

00:01:43.872 --> 00:01:47.317
why I really encourage like, the therapists I work with now, to ask people, you

00:01:47.317 --> 00:01:52.771
know, how do you gender identify. Or I gender identify as, as a girl and as a

00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:57.310
woman and please you the pronoun she and her. Because we can't make

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.057
assumptions. For example, some people might feel very androgynous. Where they

00:02:01.057 --> 00:02:05.118
have a mixed feeling of being masculine and feminine. Maybe they prefer the

00:02:05.118 --> 00:02:11.750
gender pronoun of they, and them. So we just can't know. and I think that's

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.336
exciting. I mean, I think the idea that gender can be and is constructed in

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:24.309
multitudes of ways that we can't even really grok is kind of amazing.
