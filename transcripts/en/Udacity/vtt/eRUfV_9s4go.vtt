00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Debugging statements left in the code may even come up with a security problem.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In Mac OS versions 10.7.2/10.7.3, there was a security issue because a programmer

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
had left debugging print statements in the code.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This would result in the following situation--you as a user would enter your password into the Mac

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the Mac would then let you in or not let you in but at the same time would store your password

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in the clear in, a log that would be visible for anyone--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
anyone with access to the machine of course, and this again would require a password.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
On a multi-user machine, for instance, or somebody having physical access to a hard drive,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
a mean checker could not go and retrieve your password in the clear,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and that's simply because of some left debugging statement in there.
