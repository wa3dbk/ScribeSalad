00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.368
Let's talk about the specific stages of language development. The first stage

00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:08.240
is cooing. Cooing are the first sounds that human babies make, other than

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.130
crying. And this happens within the first six months of an infant's life.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.960
Cooing is almost exclusively vowels. So things like ooh, or e, for example.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.384
It's interesting to note that cooing is universal for all babies. Meaning

00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:27.882
babies all across the world coo in almost the exact same way. This includes

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:32.131
babies who can hear, as well as babies who are deaf. The next stage is

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:36.550
babbling, babbling occurs after about five or six months of an infant's life.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.770
This is when infants start to experience with different sounds call phoneme.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.422
Phonemes consist of both vowels and consonants. An interesting thing to note

00:00:45.422 --> 00:00:48.973
here is that through repeated exposure to their native language, infants start

00:00:48.973 --> 00:00:53.965
to prune out sounds that aren't native to their language. They actually lose

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:59.086
the ability to say and perceive non-native language sounds. That's why it can

00:00:59.086 --> 00:01:02.365
be so difficult to learn a new language. And after babbling is one word

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:08.120
utterances. This is when babies say things like da-da or mama or the famous no.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.875
Next would be the two word utterances. This happens at around 18 months. But

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:15.671
I'm going to send you to Greg who has a good example of this.
