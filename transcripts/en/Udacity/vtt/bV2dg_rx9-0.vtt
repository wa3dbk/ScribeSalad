00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.098
It turns out that the bus travels at 50 miles per hour, and the van travels at

00:00:04.098 --> 00:00:09.580
60 miles per hour. Great algebra solving if you got those two correct. We can

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.856
start solving this equation by multiplying both sides by the lowest common

00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:19.460
denominator. That would be x times x minus 10. We're really just cross

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.680
multiplying, so we get 200x equal 240 times x minus 10. Next, we distribute the

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.786
240 to get this equation and then we subtract 240x from both sides. This leads

00:00:32.786 --> 00:00:37.690
us to this equation which we can then use to solve for x. We just divide both

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.406
sides by negative 40. So we'll have 1x is equal to 60. Now that we've solved

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:47.702
for x, we want to remember what it actually represents. In this case we know x

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:52.860
was the speed or the rate of the van. So, we know the van speed is really 60

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.088
mph, and the bus's speed would have to be 10 less than that. So the bus

00:00:58.088 --> 00:00:59.560
traveled at 50 mph.
