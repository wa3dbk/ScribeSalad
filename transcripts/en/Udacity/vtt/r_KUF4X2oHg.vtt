00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.320
As you probably realized by now, at job development, it's a

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.280
lot about testing. So there is a lot of emphasis on

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.420
testing. Testing first, te, testing early. So that's the reason why

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.710
I also want to discuss what is the testing strategy in XP.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.820
So first of all what is the basic principle? The basic

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.770
principle is that testing is Coded confidence. You write your test

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.150
cases and then you can run them anytime you want. And

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.540
if they pass, they'll give you confidence that your code is behaving

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.920
the way it's expected. If they don't pass on the other

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.870
hand, you'll know that there's something to fix. Another important concept is

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.600
that test might be isolated and automated. So both the running and

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.400
the checking of the tests has to be automated for all of

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.830
this to work. And there are two types of tests. The first

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.170
type of test is unit tests, that are created by the programmers,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.830
and they're created by looking at the task cards. The task cards

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.410
describe what they implemented, functionality should

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.740
do, and therefore allows the developers.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.970
The right test that can test this functionality. That can

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.000
check that the code's correctly implemented functionality. And as we

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.670
said, you should really test every meaninful feature. So, for

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.250
example, you should test every meaningful method in your classes.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.490
You should put specific attention to possibly complex implementations, special

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.100
cases or specific problems that you might think of. while

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.110
reading the task cards. In some cases, when you do

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.800
refactoring, you might also want to write test cases specific

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.300
to that refactoring. But we'll say more about that. So this

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.610
was for the first kind of tests that are involved in

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.650
the, in the XP process. The second kind of tests are

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.710
the system tests, also called acceptance tests. And those tests involve

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.920
the customer. So basically what happens is that the customer provides

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.760
the test cases for their stores and then the development team

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.630
transforms those into actual automated tests. So these are tests created

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.700
by the developers. They run very quickly and they run very frequently.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.120
These are tests developed with the help, with the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.170
involvement of the customer they run longer. And run less

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.710
frequently, they run every time the system is integrated.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.890
According to the cycle we saw a few minutes ago.
