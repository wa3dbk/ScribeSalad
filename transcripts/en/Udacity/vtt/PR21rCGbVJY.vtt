00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.557
To find the first x intercept, I take my equation and I set y equal to 0. I know

00:00:04.557 --> 00:00:09.061
any number times 0 is 0 so I have negative 2x equals 8. Dividing both sides by

00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:13.675
negative 2, I get both sides equal to negative 4. So, our x intercept occurs at

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:18.646
x equals negative 4 and the point is negative 4, comma 0. For the Y intercept, I

00:00:18.646 --> 00:00:23.642
set x equal to 0. Negative 2 times 0 is 0 and I'm left with 4Y is equal to 8. We

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:28.639
divide both sides by 4 to get y is equal to 2. So, our y intercept occurs at y

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:33.459
equals 2, but the point is 0, 2. For the second equation, we can find the x

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:38.554
intercept in the same way. We set y equal to 0. So this term drops out. And I

00:00:38.554 --> 00:00:43.746
get 3x is equal to 6, then we divide both sides by 3, and x equals 2, so our x

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:49.394
intercept occurs at x equal 2 and we have the point 2 comma 0. This y intercept

00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:54.938
is a little bit harder, we do the same process for y intercepts we set x equals

00:00:54.938 --> 00:01:00.032
0, so x is 0, so am left with 9y equal to 6. We want to solve for y, so we need

00:01:00.032 --> 00:01:04.578
to divide by 9. So I have y is equal to 6 9ths. If we remember back from

00:01:04.578 --> 00:01:09.529
fractions, we know that a 3 goes into both the numerator and the denominator, so

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:14.324
I can simplify this fraction. 6 divided by 3 makes 2, and 9 divided by 3 makes

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:19.008
3, so I'm left with 2 3rds. 0 comma 2 3rds is our y-intercept here. For this

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:23.922
last equation, we can find the x intercept again by setting y equal to 0, then

00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:28.759
solve for x and divide both sides by 4. 0 divided by 4 makes both sides 0. So,

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.838
our x intercept occurs at point 0,0. To find the Y intercept, you let x equal 0,

00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:38.334
so I get y is equal to 0. Whoa. This is the same point and their both the origin

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:42.440
so something is going on with this line. We'll learn about this equation in the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.470
upcoming lessons but if you're interested try graphing this and see if you can

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.959
figure out what's going on.
