00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.330
Let's look at the answer. A bank account

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.050
number, that sounds pretty unique. So that could be

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.990
a good candidate to have as a keyname/ID. A

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.930
date, is probably not a good keyname/ID, because it's

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.500
most likely not unique across the entities. But

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.440
it could be. It all depends on the modeling,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.370
of course. The price, does not sound like a

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.290
good keyname/ID either for the same reasons I stated.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.060
An email address. Yeah, that could be a good keyname/ID. Because it's

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.880
very likely, it's unique across entities. All right. I hope you did well.
