00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.330
So each x that we see we want to substitute negative m directly into that spot.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.984
Since we know that the entire quantity x is squared, we need to make sure that

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:13.650
the entire quantity negative m is squared. So I put parentheses around it to

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.328
indicate this. The same thing is true with subtracting here. You have minus

00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:22.289
negative m and then plus 2. So let's simplify this, negative m squared turns out

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.851
to be just m squared. Since the negative signs will multiply with one another

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:31.845
and turn in to a positive sign. Minus negative m is the same as plus m and then

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:34.340
we have plus 2 at the end. Great!
