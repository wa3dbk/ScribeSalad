00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.712
We can solve for b by simply substituting in the values x and y that we know

00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:11.521
from our point. If we do that and a bit simple algebra, we can[UNKNOWN] the

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:17.793
value for b of 2800. Inserting this into our equation, gives us a final equation

00:00:17.793 --> 00:00:21.086
in[UNKNOWN] form of y equals 2x plus 2800.
