00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.949
Here are the conjugates and here are the products. Great work if you found at

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.310
least four of those. We know for the conjugate we just change the sign between

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.366
the two terms so the conjugate of 1 minus root 11 is 1 plus root 11. Here we

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:17.170
change the subtraction sign to a positive. And here we change the positive sign

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.659
to a negative. For the products we want to use our pattern for the difference

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:25.536
of two squares. We know the product of two binomials with differing signs will

00:00:25.536 --> 00:00:30.856
be a squared minus b squared. So we can square a which is 1 here And squared b,

00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:37.520
which is the root of 11. One squared equals 1, and root 11 squared equals 11.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.760
We find the difference of these squares, which is 1 minus 11, which equal

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.184
negative 10. For the second one, when we square the a term, we'll have 9 times

00:00:46.184 --> 00:00:52.528
2, we square the 3 and we square the root 2. For b squared, or square two which

00:00:52.528 --> 00:00:56.778
is four, and we square the square root of three, which equals three. We know

00:00:56.778 --> 00:01:01.887
nine times two is 18, and four times three is 12. This gives us a final answer

00:01:01.887 --> 00:01:06.470
of six. And for the last one, we have negative five squared for the a term and

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.766
six root two squared for the b. Negative five squared is 25 and 6 root 2

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:21.260
squared is 36 times 2 or 72. 25 minus 72 equals negative 47.
