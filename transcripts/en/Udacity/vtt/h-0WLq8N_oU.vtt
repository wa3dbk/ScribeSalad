The first thing that's happening to x, is 
we're adding 3 to it.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.350
So that means that g of x our inner 
fraction down here, should be x plus 3.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.939
After that, that quantity is squared. 
So our order function here, f of x should

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.581
be x squared. 
I think this really highlights the fact

00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:20.730
that h of x, represents a transformation 
of x squared.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.434
A shift of x squared by 3 to left.
