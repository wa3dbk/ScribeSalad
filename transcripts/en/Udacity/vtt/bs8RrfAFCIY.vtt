00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.661
Well, there's 1 row of pixels which is not diverged down here,

00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:07.288
1 row of pixels which are not diverged down here.

00:00:07.288 --> 00:00:15.235
So there's 1022 rows of pixels that do have diverged warps, 1 here and 1 here, 1 on each side.

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:24.576
So the answer is 1022 times 2 warps, which is 2044 warps or 1920 threads.

00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:27.373
And we launched a million threads to deal with a million pixels in this image,

00:00:27.373 --> 00:00:32.770
so that means that just over 6% of the threads in this entire kernel

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.981
are running at perhaps half efficiency for part of the kernel,

00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:40.256
which is probably not worth trying to optimize.
