00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.440
There are two more features I wanted to mention on inputs.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.360
The required attribute and the place holder attribute. Required just let's

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.330
me say, this field is required before you can submit the

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.430
form. So, for example, if I want to make sure that

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.880
my lemur afficianados enter a telephone number, I can do that

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.690
right on the input. Now, if I try to go into

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.330
this field, and let's say I don't want to give a telephone

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.430
number, so I just skip it And I try to submit

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.150
the form. It tells me that I have to fill that field

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.800
out. The other feature, is the placeholder text. You may want to give

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.440
hints to your users. In some fields, they go away when they start

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.390
typing. You can do that pretty easily by just setting a placeholder attribute.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.870
And now you can tell I get placeholder text

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.600
in that field. But once I start typing something,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.260
it goes away. None of this removes the need

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.670
for server side validation of course, but it does

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.440
make it easier users not to accidentally submit something

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.490
that's not valid, and it doesn't require any JavaScript

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.780
on your page to do that or to provide

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.110
place holder text that get's out of the user's way.
