00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.440
And your file system has features that extend the privilege levels provided by

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.690
the unique file system symantics. This

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.910
includes groups and sub groups and. Accesses

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.810
for files with both positive and

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.110
negative rights. Negative rights is especially useful

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.640
for quick revocation. Further, it also introduces

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.040
the notion of audit chain for system

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.320
administrators modifying the system. I urge you

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.159
to read this paper in its entirety.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.730
To get a feel for the extensions proposed in the Android file system. The

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.320
main takeaway, however, in this lesson is

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.960
how, as operating system designers, we can

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.110
take the best solution that is out

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.310
there for information security and implement a

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:58.940
secure and usable distributed system. Further, once designed and implemented,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.150
we should be able to bench mark our solution against the design principles laid

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.100
out by Salser on information security, and know the vulnerabilites that exist in

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.650
our solution. This last point is particularly important to safeguard our system

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.880
against attackers. As we mentioned at the outset of this course

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.940
module, the topic of information security is fascinating, and it is of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.690
high relevance in this information age. Hopefully this course module has spurred

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.230
your interest. In information security, to seek, more, and future courses.
