00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.681
So now that you've set your two
marketing goals to work off of,

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:05.301
let's explore this a little bit more.

00:00:05.301 --> 00:00:08.005
Now make sure you're thinking about
what you hope to actually achieve and

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.550
what outcomes you're really looking for.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.250
&gt;&gt; You need to think about
different objectives for

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.690
different stages in
your product lifecycle.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.270
Is your goal now branding,
or drive traffic?

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.530
Increase ad downloads?

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.630
Improve engagement?

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.280
Is it a call to action?

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.170
We don't have to be too visionary here.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.140
These are not our
startup's high level goals.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.190
And we're not going to change
the world with our marketing goals.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.600
We want you to set goals that
are down to Earth and attainable.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.980
So think short-term goals,
like within the next few months.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.330
That way, you can break them
into smaller pieces and

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.910
can track them easily.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.145
Also be authentic.

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:41.680
Pick a goal you actually care about,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.540
that will be meaningful
to your business.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.000
This will help you to stick to it and
achieve it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.530
To be able to track your goals,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.210
they have to be measurable and
aligned with your performance.
