Using the screen support page

00:00:01.728 --> 00:00:03.816
and whatever technical
specification details

00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:05.275
you can find on the internet,

00:00:05.275 --> 00:00:08.384
what are the sizes and densities
of these two devices,

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:10.613
the Nexus One and the Nexus 5?

00:00:10.632 --> 00:00:14.369
For these purposes, the screen size
should be one of the available buckets,

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.365
small, normal, large, or extra large.

00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:20.470
And, the pixel density should always
refer to one of our buckets,

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.247
LDPI, MDPI, HDPI, XHDPI, or XXHDPI.
