00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.364
The demo performed 2 separate actions, selecting the object clicked on, and if

00:00:03.364 --> 00:00:06.268
any object was found, then the object itself was modified and the point clicked

00:00:06.268 --> 00:00:11.100
on was highlighted. Picking objects on the screen with a mouse is quite simple

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.623
in Three.js. Here's the first half of the MouseDown function which sets up to

00:00:14.623 --> 00:00:19.800
perform picking. The bulk of the code fires a ray from the eye into the world.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.022
This is a common way to perform picking. WebGL itself is focused on rendering,

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:26.978
so has no real support for picking in other forms of interaction. It's up to

00:00:26.978 --> 00:00:30.204
the program to figure this out. To form a ray from the eye through the screen

00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:35.050
we need two points. One's the eye's position in the world space, that's easy.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.882
The other is formed using a point on the screen, that point being locate

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:41.557
wherever the user clicked the mouse. What we want to know is this point's

00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:45.611
location in world space. To do so we need to travel upstream, back along the

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:49.181
chain of transformations: window coordinates to normalized device coordinates,

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:54.735
to view, to world coordinates. Happily, Three.js makes this easy. How many

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:57.882
times have I said that sentence during this course? The 2D point from the

00:00:57.882 --> 00:01:01.976
MouseDown event is a document object model screen coordinate. This is like a

00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:04.690
WebGL window coordinate, only y equals 0 is at the top edge of the screen

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.272
instead of the bottom. The mouse vector code here converts from this screen

00:01:09.272 --> 00:01:12.440
coordinate system into normalized device coordinates, which go from -1 to 1 in

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.410
x and y. The z value doesn't really matter. Any value from z equals -1 to 1

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.613
will form a point on the ray. We next create a projector object. Really, it's

00:01:21.613 --> 00:01:24.913
better to create this object once during initialization and reuse it here, but

00:01:24.913 --> 00:01:29.205
I wanted to show the code all in one piece. The final line of code does the

00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:33.028
heavy lifting. It takes the NDC coordinate and forms a raycaster object from

00:01:33.028 --> 00:01:36.986
it. Ray casting is like ray tracing except you only trace rays from the eye

00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:41.314
into the scene and no further. No new rays are spawn from intersections. Once

00:01:41.314 --> 00:01:45.950
we have this raycaster object, we can perform picking, aslo called hit testing.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.665
It's one line of code to pick. You feed a list of objects into the raycaster

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:53.596
and it returns an array of intersections. The If statement checks if the ray

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:56.760
has anything in it. If it does then one or more intersections have been

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.312
detected. These intersections are sorted front to back, so the first

00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:04.564
intersection on the list is the closest, which is usually the one we want. This

00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:07.416
first intersection has information about what the ray hit, including the

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:12.040
object, face and the face's index in the object. We use the object parameter in

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.275
the next slide to change the material to a random color. The intersects record

00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:20.138
also includes the distance and the point in world space. To show where the

00:02:20.138 --> 00:02:23.005
object was hit, we add a small sphere to the scene using this intersection

00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:26.510
point for its location. These are just examples, you can do whatever you like

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.530
with the intersection information you get back.
