00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
And the correct answer here is that the running time of Bob's algorithm is 2^n  n²,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.250
which is just the same running time as the algorithm that Alice was using,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.620
and the reasons are also very similar.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.350
If you have n genes, then again there's 2^n assignments of 0 and 1 to the genes,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:27.570
and checking if an assignment is valid, so checking if all genes that have a 1 are connected

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.670
will also take O(n²&lt;i&gt;).&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.870
That, of course, depends a bit on how many 1's there are in the assignment,

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.050
but a worst-case analysis would be here that close to n genes have been assigned 1,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.500
so we need to check all of their connections which similar to Alice's algorithm,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.820
you already know there are about n² many of them.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.430
Bob, similar to Alice, has so far only found an algorithm that is totally impractical

00:00:54.430 --> 99:59:59.000
for the problem that he's trying to solve because it has exponential running time.
