00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.450
The second common architecture for

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.400
Internet services is referred to
as functionally heterogeneous.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.720
In these kinds of architectures,
different nodes are designated to

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.370
perform certain functions, or even to
see in the particular types of requests.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.000
For instance, the request may be divided
among the servers based on the request

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.720
content, such as when the requests

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.560
are divided based on the alphabetical
order of the requested file name.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.485
Or for a service such as eBay,
servers may be designated to perform

00:00:29.485 --> 00:00:32.791
browsing requests versus buying or
bidding requests.

00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:36.565
With this design, it is still
possible to have all of the data in

00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:41.070
some distributed, shared file system and
accessible to all of the nodes.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.866
But if the functions are somehow
designated to be executed only

00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.947
on some subset of the node,

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:52.921
then it is possible that not all
of the data, not all of the state,

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:58.360
will be necessary to be made available
across all nodes in the system.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.900
So there's some optimization
opportunities there.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.760
Clearly, one benefit of this approach is
that every single node in this system

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.460
is more specialized for some of
the tasks that it performs, or for

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.770
some of the state that it needs to
serve, and therefore, it is more likely

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.820
that it will take advantage of some
benefits like caching and locality.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.170
There are also some obvious trade-offs.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.120
The first one is that the front end
will now need to be more complex

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.340
because it will need to parse sufficient
portion of the incoming request so

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.440
as to be able to figure out which
one of the underlying nodes

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.680
this particular request
should be passed to.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.240
Second, the overall management of these
systems becomes more complex when nodes

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.110
fail or when request rates increase,
and we need to add more machines,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.370
it is important to know what
kinds of machines to add.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.360
How to configure those machines,
what types of requests or

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.280
tasks are those machines
suppose to be designated for.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.110
Also even if something changes in
the workload pattern and all of a sudden

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.180
there are more requests of a certain
kind, then we have to reconfigure this.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.110
We can't just redirect those access of
requests to some of the other nodes if

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.100
they are not capable of processing
those kind of actions or

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.580
serving that kind of data.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.960
So that may even be the case if
the other nodes are otherwise idling.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.420
The result of that is that it is much
more easy in these kinds of environments

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.730
to end up in situations in which
some of the nodes are hotspots, and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.680
then there are long backlogs of pending
requests for those kinds of nodes.
