The answer is p equals nc minus m. This is just a simple case of substitution,

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:08.418
like we've done many times before. We do need to pay close attention to the

00:00:08.418 --> 00:00:12.605
money earned term right here. If Grant is only earning money from wiper set

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:16.759
sales, then the money he brings in is going to be equal to the number of wiper

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.274
sets he sells times the price per wiper set.
