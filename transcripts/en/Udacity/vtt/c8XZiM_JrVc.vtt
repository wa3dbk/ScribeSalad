00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.300
So, let's do a quiz on the relative merits of processor performance, power,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.390
weight, and cost. We will have several processor models with

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.250
the relative performance, expected battery life, weight

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.784
of the overall computer, and the cost of the processor. The

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:25.890
question for you is, which one of these will be the worst for laptops.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.366
The first model is the CRAWLIUM. There's very

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:33.174
little performance, very long battery life, extremely light,

00:00:33.174 --> 00:00:35.770
and dirt cheap. The next model is the

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.440
SLOWIUM. It has much more performance, half the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.820
battery life, however. It's still very light, but

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.360
it's four times as heavy as the CRAWLIUM.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.734
And about three times more expensive. Then we

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:51.024
have our LAPTIUM processor. It has twice the performance

00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:55.710
of the SLOWIUM, five hours of battery life. It's twice as heavy as the SLOWIUMN,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.644
costS about $100. Then we have the FASTIUM,

00:00:58.644 --> 00:01:02.879
which has more performance, significantly less battery life,

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.910
however. It's about one pound in weight, cost

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.163
$200 for the processor. Then we have the

00:01:09.163 --> 00:01:13.051
HOTIUM at more performance, 15 minute battery life,

00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:16.534
3 pounds and $500 and the BURNIUM processor,

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.450
double the performance of the HOTIUM, its

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.690
battery lasts 2 minutes, it's 20 pounds in

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.295
weight and costs $5,000. So, which one of

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:29.530
these would you least want in your laptop.
