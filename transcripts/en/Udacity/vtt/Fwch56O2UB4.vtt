00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.730
We just saw that after one year, if Grant's account compounds interest twice a

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.754
year, he'll end up with 10,000 times 1 plus 0.015 squared dollars. Now I want

00:00:12.754 --> 00:00:16.146
you to think back to that hypothesis you made earlier and how the situation is

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:22.174
different this time. What does this exponent here mean? Well, remember, we're

00:00:22.174 --> 00:00:27.161
going to multiply by this number every time interest is compounded. So, what

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:31.461
exponents belong here and here? To help us figure out how much money is in the

00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:34.640
account after 2 years and after 3 years.
