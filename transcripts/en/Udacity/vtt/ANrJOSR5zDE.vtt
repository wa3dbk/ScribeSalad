00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.412
Our solutions for x are 5 plus or minus 2 times root 3. Great thinking if you

00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:10.720
got this. Now, I know we haven't done that much practice yet. So that's totally

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.724
okay if you struggled. I'm sure you'll get the next one. We begin to solve this

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:18.820
problem by taking the square root of both sides. Since we have a quantity

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.024
squared, with a variable inside it, on the left. Taking this square root undoes

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:26.888
the square power. Leaving us with x minus 5 on the left hand side of our

00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:30.778
equation. On the right hand side, we'll just have plus or minus the square root

00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:36.984
of 12. Next, we'll add 5 to both sides to isolate our x variable. So, we'll

00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:41.678
have x is equal to 5 plus or minus the square root of 12. And again, here this

00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:46.135
5 is not like terms with the radical 12. So we can't add them together, we just

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:50.846
list them as a sum and difference. We need to simplify the root of 12, so we

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:55.153
break it into 4 times 3, this gives us our final answer of 5 plus or minus 2

00:00:55.153 --> 00:00:57.734
root 3.
