Using SQLite makes it easy to delete,
update, and insert rows

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:06.603
using highly expressive queries.

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:11.503
One can even add new columns 
as you revision your database.

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:14.316
It's not a surprise 
that just about every popular app

00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:16.705
makes some use of SQLite in Android.

00:00:16.813 --> 00:00:20.620
It's a very popular and important component
of the Android solution.

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:23.424
Android also provides 
a huge set of helper functions

00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:25.972
to make working with databases easy,

00:00:25.972 --> 00:00:28.541
including functions 
to automate query building,

00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:33.010
display ListViews populated by queries
and even compile statements.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.020
For more information 
about databases in Android,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.819
see the Instructor Notes.

00:00:38.293 --> 00:00:39.854
One thing that I wanted to mention

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:41.779
is that we're teaching you 
the fundamentals

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:45.022
of how to build database 
in a content provider on Android.

00:00:45.193 --> 00:00:48.246
The idea is that once you are done
with this class,

00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:50.340
you'll have a good understanding 
of how it all works,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.568
even if you end up using a library 
to help build your database

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:56.234
and content provider 
in your future applications.

00:00:56.254 --> 00:00:59.580
That's it for a brief intro 
into storage on Android.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.857
If you want to learn more, 
go to developer.android.com

00:01:02.857 --> 00:01:04.681
and search on Data Storage.
