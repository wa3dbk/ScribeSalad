As you go through this course, and when you're

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.580
analyzing data on your own, we want you to

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.380
keep the following in mind. Always be curious and

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.834
skeptical when you're taking a look at data. Nate Silver

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:14.910
a statistician noted for his work in baseball and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.660
in politics, captured the sentiment as well. He said, People

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.890
should be more skeptical when they see numbers. They

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.430
should be willing to play around with the data themselves.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.070
Exploratory data analysis is one of the best tools that we

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.832
have for playing with the data. For letting the data speak

00:00:34.832 --> 00:00:40.277
really directly. When conducting an exploratory data analysis. We want to

00:00:40.277 --> 00:00:44.607
test our intuitions about the data set and develop new intuitions.

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:46.568

00:00:46.568 --> 00:00:49.472
When you're going through this course and analyzing the data sets that we're

00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:51.917
going to take a look at. We want you to be excited to play

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:55.421
with the data. But we also want you to be open to detecting

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:58.096
oddities in the data. Especially through

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:01.270
the visualizations and summaries that you produce.
