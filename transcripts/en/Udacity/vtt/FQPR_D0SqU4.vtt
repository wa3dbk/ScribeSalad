00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Pretty straightforward.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If we don't have at least 3 elements in the path, that means we don't have an action there.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's just an individual state. The cost of that should be 0.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Otherwise, we look at the second element from the end.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There's a final state and then there's a final action.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That should be the final action and total cost--this tuple--we just return the total cost.

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For the bridge cost of an action, it's just the maximum of the two times.
