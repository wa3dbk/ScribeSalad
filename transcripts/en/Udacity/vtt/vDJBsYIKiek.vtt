Let's consider a new function. We have f of x equals x minus six, times x plus

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.570
two, times x minus four. I'd like to discuss how to evaluate this function and

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.693
a few very special points. And this is going to help us figure out how to

00:00:14.693 --> 00:00:19.324
factor polynomials better. So if we consider this function, then what do we get

00:00:19.324 --> 00:00:23.323
for f of four? And what do we get for f of negative two?
