00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.460
At this point, you should be getting
a correctly formatted URL for

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.670
text and lat-long searches.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.039
Let's go ahead and complete
the next steps to make the request.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.660
We'll create a constant for
the shared NSURLSession, and

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.100
then we need to create an NSURLRequest
from our URL that's being created

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.650
by that flickrURLFromParameters method.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.000
There we go.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.540
After this,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.760
let's create a data task using NSURL
sessions data task with request method.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.679
Remember, this method let's us provide
a closer called a completion handler

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.817
that'll be executed when
the task completes.

00:00:41.618 --> 00:00:45.184
For now let's just print the raw
data if no error occurs,

00:00:45.184 --> 00:00:48.910
otherwise let's print some
information about the error.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.390
And then the last step is to start this
task by calling its resume method.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.709
Now let's make sure everything works.

00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:10.481
And we see the raw JSON data's being
printed, and there's no error.

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:15.250
That's a good start.
