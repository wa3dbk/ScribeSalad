00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.930
When we were learning
that responsive design,

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.970
we saw that a common pattern 
was to use the MasterDetailFlow,

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.713
which is what were going
to use for Sunshine.

00:00:07.713 --> 00:00:09.506
Here are the tablet mocks.

00:00:09.506 --> 00:00:12.370
We have a list of forecasts on the left, 
and then for the selected item,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.010
we see the detail pane on the right.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.840
This applies for 7-inch 
and 10-inch tablet's,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.610
both portrait and landscape orientations.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.370
In portrait mode, the columns
are just a little bit narrower,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.360
but it's still a two-pane UI.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.800
In terms of implementation, all of this
will be under the MainActivity.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.020
Then on the left we have 
the ForecastFragment.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.630
And then on the right, 
we have the DetailFragment.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.546
On the phone, we would still have the
MainActivity with the list of forecast.

00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:40.960
And then selecting an item 
would still launch the DetailActivity.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.480
Here's another way to visualize it.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.000
On the tablet, we have two fragments 
side by side under one activity.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.260
And then on the phone, 
we have the first activity

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.930
containing the first fragment.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.953
Selecting an item will launch 
the second activity

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:54.856
containing the second fragment.

00:00:54.856 --> 00:00:57.120
We're going to break this up 
into multiple coding tasks

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.230
until we build up the final layout.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.520
First we'll build up 
the two-pane UI for tablet's.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.569
Then we'll hook up the communication
between the two fragments

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.330
so that's selecting an item 
replaces the detail pane on the right.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.390
Then we'll learn how to show
and activated state

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.180
on the currently selected item,
so we know what the details pane

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.110
corresponds to.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.320
We'll also need to make sure
that the scroll position

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.143
is maintained across orientation changes.

00:01:20.143 --> 00:01:24.316
After that, we'll update the DetailLayout
so it's optimized for these wider screens.

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:27.000
And then we'll modify the adapter 
so that the today layout

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.660
looks like the other days.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.570
There's no special 
today layout on the tablet.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.720
So hopefully it's clear 
how we're going to approach

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.704
implementing this tablet behavior

00:01:34.704 --> 00:01:38.000
and we're going to step 
through it slowly, one by one.
