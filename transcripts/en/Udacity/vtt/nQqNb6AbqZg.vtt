At this point you see a few
examples of validation rules.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.410
So can I throw you out there and have
you write the rest of the validation

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.840
rules while I attend to other
things around the company?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.540
I've written up two specs.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.635
So the first one will
just get you up and

00:00:14.635 --> 00:00:17.590
running with the validation rules for
a shopping list item.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.100
The others will let you finish off
the rest of the validation rules.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.780
Here take a look.
