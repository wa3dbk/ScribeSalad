00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.570
In the lesson today, all of our examples came from natural language

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.820
understanding. But understanding is a very journal purpose cognitive task.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.620
Natural language understanding is just one instance of understanding.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.440
Understanding is about making sense of the world.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.050
The world bombards us with data that comes in many forms. Acoustic, visual,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.720
verbal, numerical. It's a very hard problem. How do we make sense of the world?

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.460
There are three sources of power. First, we exploit constraints about the world.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.450
We know that the world behaves in certain ways. Whether it's a physical world or

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.270
the social world, or grammatical world.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.400
Second, we have structured knowledge representations. The structured knowledge

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.320
representations in memory capture not just knowledge and its representation, but

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.850
the organization of knowledge, and there is power in that organization.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.310
The power lies in the third part. Low level problem with processing helps us

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.736
activate these knowledge structures from memory. Once activated,

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:08.577
these knowledge structures generate expectations that make the processing top

00:01:08.577 --> 00:01:12.440
down. And there's a lot of power in being able to generate those expectations.
