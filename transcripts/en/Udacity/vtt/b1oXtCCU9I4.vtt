00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.990
Starting with this weird selector, right here,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.300
with dollar sign open parenthesis, quotes, quotes, close parenthesis.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.990
This is an indication that you're using jQuery.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.140
The dollar sign parenthesis quotes syntax is only used for

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.180
jQuery, and it grabs an element on the page, which in this case,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.090
is the class identified by this .super-header-wrapper.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.090
We run the .html method on it, which in this case is going to replace the HTML

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.100
of everything of the class super-header-wrapper with the HTML we see right here.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.600
In this case, this HTML is going to embed a picture.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.210
So, when I press Enter, we can see that we've now changed the Udacity homepage

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.750
to this awesome picture of the Android teaching on the Udacity platform.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.320
&gt;&gt; That is an awesome picture and just to be clear, you only made the change for

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.740
this local copy of the page, not the actual website.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.880
So if you refresh the page, you'll see that it goes back to normal
