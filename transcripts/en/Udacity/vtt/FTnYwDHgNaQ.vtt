00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
Now, before dug deeper into the more sophisticated algorithms,

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.039
I would like to briefly tell you a little about a technique known as brute force.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.520
So what does brute force mean? Does it mean that we take a hammer

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.220
and beat the answer out of our computer?

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.840
Of course not. Brute force is the algorithm that Alice, Bob, and Carol were using initially.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.520
So, you remember, for example, that for Bob,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.070
we were using an algorithm like this or not using but proposing an algorithm like this at least

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.020
that simply went through all possible assignments of zero and one to the vertices,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.670
or at that time, we steal common genes and weakness of this algorithm was that

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.020
it had a pretty unacceptable running time

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.680
as soon as you got to more than 20 or 30 vertices in the network.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.000
But this algorithm actually also has two strength.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.370
One strength from it is that it's very simple, and the other thing is that,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.130
because it's so simple, you can actually also implement it rather fast.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.800
Under certain conditions, using an algorithm like this,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.710
actually might not be that bad an idea

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.970
in this method of using all possible assignments.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.310
First of all, we're not confused the hammer here.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.490
This method if going through all possible assignments without any more sophisticated

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.330
techniques or sophisticated algorithmic techniques is known as brute force.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.820
And so, as I've explained to you, there are certain conditions for brute force is actually desirable.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.430
So, let's have you figure out what those conditions could be,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.700
and by brute force, of course, we try all possibilities.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.970
Could it be that when you don't have much time to design and program a more sophisticated algorithm.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.440
Could it be when the instances where the inputs for which you're trying to solve your problem are small.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.550
Say n is the size of the problem smaller than 20

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.420
or could it be when you need to solve the problem only once

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.560
and the input might be a little bit bigger there.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.880
For each one, I'm going to give you two choices

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.170
whether under these conditions using brute force could be okay

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.790
and the first one is a maybe and second one is a definitive no.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.070
I'm not going to give you a clear yes choice because,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.030
obviously, since we're dealing with NP complete problems here,

00:01:59.030 --> 99:59:59.000
brute force is never generally advisable of course.
