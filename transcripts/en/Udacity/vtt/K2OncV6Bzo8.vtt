00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.479
This time the z score is 2.44 greater than our z critical value, that means

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:10.721
that our sample mean falls somewhere up here. The probability of obtaining this

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:15.680
sample mean from a sample of size 50 is really small less than 2.5% and that's

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.976
what we need to know for a two tailed test therefore, we'll reject the null. We

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:26.500
have evidence to believe that the song had an effect on engagement. We

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.990
formalize this by writing p for probability, is less than 0.05, our alpha

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.940
level. Because the probability of obtaining this sample mean, from a sample of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.373
size 50, is less than our alpha level.
