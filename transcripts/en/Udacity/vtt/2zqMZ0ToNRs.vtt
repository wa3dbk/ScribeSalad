00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:01.897
And the answer is 1.25.

00:00:02.116 --> 00:00:03.732
That’s still a significant number,

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:06.080
but NASA had now all reason to believe

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.987
cold temperatures are good for you.

00:00:08.246 --> 00:00:10.857
I should say there’s another kind of flaw here,

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.081
one we will discuss in a second,

00:00:13.295 --> 00:00:14.470
but one that’s kind of often is

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:16.178
the only looked at data with failures,

00:00:16.647 --> 00:00:18.508
so that would give us a number

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.862
that is by definition larger than 1

00:00:20.923 --> 00:00:22.738
But most flights had no failures.

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:25.449
So the actual expectation should be even lower.

00:00:25.523 --> 00:00:27.624
So NASA was even more confident

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.516
that this thing could be flown safely.

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:32.000
How wrong they were.
