00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.250
The problem of losing parameter bindings is pretty widespread since any

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.070
function like setTimeout that takes another function as

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.150
a calback may actually call that function differently than you expected.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.930
Callback functions are inherently designed so

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.680
that they will be invoked by the system you pass them to.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.380
Thus, you generally have very little control over what the bindings will be for

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.830
the parameter of the functions that you passed in.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.000
For this reason, you need to be careful about all the parameter bindings,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.800
including the parameter this,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.470
whenever you pass a function as an input to another function.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.030
Despite the fact that you see an object on the left of the dot when you

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.460
pass the function in, this object will not be passed along as the binding for

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.710
the parameter this.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.090
When the system you passed it to eventually calls your Callback Function.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.250
One way to pass the callback without complicating the parameter binding

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.140
situation is to pass a different function,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.780
one that doesn't receive any parameters at all, including this.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.600
Then you just make room in the body of that function for your custom code.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.480
And inside that area, you reference your method and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.590
then you can do the indication yourself,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.340
passing along whichever bindings you want for the parameter this.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.060
We talked a lot about the keyword this, where it appears within a function.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.080
And some value may have been passed in to be bound to it.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.520
But what would happen if we saw the keyword this appearing in the global scope,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.970
not inside the body of any functions at all?

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.130
Taking a step back for

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.440
a moment, we should first consider what we expect to happen when we

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.500
access parameters outside of the function scope that they were defined within.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.620
What would we expect to happen with this attempt to log the one variable?
