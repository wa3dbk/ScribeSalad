00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.110
Let's now talk about various problems that

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.630
resulted from IPv4 and the growth of the

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.750
internet routing tables, and two different solutions

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.140
to internet routing table growth: network address translation,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.720
or NAT, and IPv6. So the main problem that we are seeing is that IPv4

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.720
addresses have only 32 bits, which means that there are, can only be a total of

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.150
2 to the 32 unique IP addresses. Not only that, as we've seen, IP

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.770
addresses are allocated in blocks, and fragmentation

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.640
of this space can mean that IPv4 addresses

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.520
can be quickly exhausted. In fact, we've

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.130
already seen the last slash eight from IPv4

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.750
address space allocated to the registries. So

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.070
we're well on our way towards running out

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.100
of IPv4 addresses. In some sense, you can say that we've

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.010
essentially already run out. In this lesson, we're going to look at

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.310
two solutions: network address translation, or NAT, and IPv6, whose main

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.670
feature is 128 bit addresses. Let's first take a look at NAT.
