00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.428
Here, you can see the declaration of the scanner. Here, we are reading an

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:11.802
integer. Here, we are reading a decimal number. And before we read anything, we

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:20.412
have a prompt. One prompt for the age, one prompt for the weight. Finally,

00:00:20.412 --> 00:00:25.344
there is an important piece that you've not seen so far, look up here. This is

00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:29.302
what's called an import statement. As it happens, the scanner class is in a

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:34.642
different location than the classes that you've used so far. That location is

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:39.790
called java.util, it's a utility class, and we have to tell the compiler that's

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.778
the place to find it. Whenever you use the scanner, simply place this statement

00:00:46.778 --> 00:00:54.230
at the top of your code. Let's go ahead and run this. The console window pops

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.890
up. Here is my prompt. Okay. I'm going to lie about my age here. Now, if that

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.129
had been my age of course the program would be right next here. I'd be 22. Not

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.410
much one can do about one's age. It does increase every year. And I lie about

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.601
my weight too. But I appreciate the sentiment that hopefully next year, it'll

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:17.106
be less. That at least should be under my control. All right. Now, you've seen

00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:22.268
how to read input, and I'd like you to do it in another program. Remember this

00:01:22.268 --> 00:01:27.612
program, in which we added the sunset effect to a photo. Now here, we used a

00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:33.296
value of 25 to increase the redness. It might be nice to experiment with other

00:01:33.296 --> 00:01:37.978
numbers. But instead of recompiling the program with all sorts of different

00:01:37.978 --> 00:01:43.156
numbers, let's turn this one into a user input. Now, we can't put the input

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:47.300
statement here. Because this method is called for every single pixel, and we

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.753
only want to supply the input once. So, here's the plan. Take out this

00:01:51.753 --> 00:01:59.128
constant, and add a parameter here. Then here, in the main method, prompt and

00:01:59.128 --> 00:02:05.636
read the input here before entering this piece of code. by the way, don't worry

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:09.820
about this loop statement here. We're going to be covering that in a couple of

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.414
lessons. Now, here is the place that the method is called. That's where you

00:02:14.414 --> 00:02:18.257
should pass the added red variable, so that each time the redden method adds

00:02:18.257 --> 00:02:23.668
that amount of red. Go ahead and do that now. If you have BlueJ, it would be

00:02:23.668 --> 00:02:27.636
best if you first develop the program in BlueJ, and then when you're done, put

00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:33.415
your result into the Udacity IDE. If you don't have BlueJ, that's okay, just do

00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:38.300
it straight in the IDE. But then you won't be able to supply your own input.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.939
You'll have to live with the input that Udacity gives you.
