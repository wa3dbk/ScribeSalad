00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.033
&gt;&gt; So to recap what we did, we found the deviation of each value from the mean.

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:10.637
Here's the deviaton. And then we squared each deviation, which is the same as

00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:16.337
the area of these squares. Then we found the average area of the squares. And

00:00:16.337 --> 00:00:21.607
then we took the square root of this area to just find the length of the side,

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:26.889
which is the standard deviation. The standard deviation is the most common

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:32.275
measure of spread, and the symbol is the lower case Greek sigma. Remember that

00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:37.126
the upper case sigma is the sigma sum sign. Recall that the variance is

00:00:37.126 --> 00:00:42.643
basically the area of this average square deviation. So when we take the square

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:46.244
root of the variance, we get the standard deviation.
