00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.610
So here are the answers. A package delivery service sounds

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.220
like a pull queue because each package is probably delivered by

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.680
independent workers that can pull tasks from the queue. What

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.500
about checking in for a flight? Well I would like to

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.810
know that I'm checked in, and in that case it's

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.460
neither a push queue nor a pull queue. Then the confirmation

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.630
would be delivered as part of the http response, even if

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.490
it takes a little bit of time. This is a situation

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.050
very similar to when you buy things using a credit

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.840
card on the internet, where you also often wait for

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.460
the response. What about code review? Well a code review

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.680
sounds like a pull queue, because you probably have many people

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.500
that can review the code, so the first one that's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.010
available can pull the code review from the queue. And then

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.690
batch processing of images, which sounds like a push queue.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.530
This is because your code is probably doing the processing of

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.340
the images. Therefore you want to have control over the execution.
