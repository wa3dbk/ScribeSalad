00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.875
So you may have noticed that I haven't actually taught you much of anything new

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:08.268
yet. All this is really just a new notation for manipulating different kinds of

00:00:08.268 --> 00:00:12.363
expressions. However, this new notation gives us an important way to think

00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:17.510
about functions. Just like variables can be added, subtracted, multiplied and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.682
divided, so can functions. In fact, there's an even shorter, easier way of

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:26.220
representing things like f of x plus g of x, or any of the other things I have

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.729
written down here. Let me show you. And, this is all it is. If we want to add

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.121
two functions, f and g, and of course they're dealing with the same variable,

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:40.931
which in this case is x. Then we just write in parentheses, f plus g, showing

00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:45.928
that they're one combined function when we add them together like this. So we

00:00:45.928 --> 00:00:52.438
have f plus g of x. Similarly, for subtraction, we can have f minus g of x. For

00:00:52.438 --> 00:00:56.190
multiplication we just multiply f and g together inside the first parentheses,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.230
and for division, we do the same thing with dividing. If we have the functions

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.190
f of x equals x, and g of x equals x squared minus x, then please tell me what

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.469
we get for each of these combined functions down here.
