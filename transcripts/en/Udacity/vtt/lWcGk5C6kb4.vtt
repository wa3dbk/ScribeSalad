00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So, we now have seen that whenever a user reports a problem in the problem database

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or a developer for that matter or anyone,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
eventually a developer or a team of developers will take a look at the problem

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and make an appropriate fix to the program.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Such fixes are also stored in a database--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
namely, a version database where all changes are stored.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Such a version database is also called a change database,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
a repository, or the configuration management system, a version control system.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Pick your choice.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
There are plenty of version control systems around these days

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which help storing these changes and the resulting versions.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Since using a version database is the first thing to use in any kind

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of civilized software development,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I will simply assume that you use such a thing on a daily basis anyway.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
An interesting thing happens, however, when you link the information

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
from the problem database to the information from the version database.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Let's assume that the problem database has a problem report #347

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
where it says remove<u>html</u>markup fails.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Let's assume the version database has recorded a change

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to function name remove<u>html</u>markup in precisely this location

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
with a comment that this now closes problem report #347,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which is a change which may well have been made after the problem was initially submitted.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We can now got and relate the change to the actual problem report,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
because the change message has the actual number of the problem report in here,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and we can use that to retrieve the precise problem report.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Since we also know where the change has been applied,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
namely in this part of the file,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
we now have a link from the problem database to a specific place in the code.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This allows us for every piece of code to identify

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the problems that were associated with it.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
What we do is we take the piece of code, look at all the changes that were made,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and look at the problems that these changes refer to.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We can then, for instance, find that remove<u>html</u>markup

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
over the history of this very course has had three fixes

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
until it finally worked.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Three fixes until a function actually works is pretty bad.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We should really worry about the quality of our coding.
