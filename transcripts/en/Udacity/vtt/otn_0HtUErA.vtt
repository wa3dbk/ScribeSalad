00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's go and extend the Python code appropriately

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
such that we now have three states instead of just two.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So we're introducing a variable named quote, which initially is false,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
because in the beginning they were non-tag mode.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And now, we simply check for double quote or a single quote,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and if we see any of these, the codes variable gets inverted.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And now, if quote is set, then the HTML markup characters should have no effect.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So we make sure that the HTML markup characters only have effect if quote is set.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Finally, we need to make sure that quotes only have a special meaning within tags,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so we make this endtag instead.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We still have our example down here, which previously failed, because of output quote foo.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let us see where this output now is properly handled and we click on run.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The output is foo.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
All the HTML markup--you can read this complex combination of quotes

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and end of markup characters is now properly removed--great.
