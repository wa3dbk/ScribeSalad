00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.282
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So these two equations give us two different ways of expressing the exact

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:09.003
same curve. But considering this one with the parentheses might not look quite

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:13.286
as pretty as this other one, why would we ever want to use the second form?

00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:17.907
Well, from it we can actually find out some information about the curve before

00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:22.239
we even graph it. If I label this first form of the equation 1 and this second

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.655
form of the equation 2, then what does equation 2 automatically tell us about

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:31.032
that we can't see right off the bat with equation 1? Thinking about the curve

00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:35.064
that it graphs, this parabola over here, can we learn very quickly about the

00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:39.096
maximum or minimum, about the x-intercepts, or about the y-intercept from

00:00:39.096 --> 00:00:39.864
equation 2?
