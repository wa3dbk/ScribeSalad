00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's assume we have a fair coin and a loaded coin

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and the loaded coin has a probability of heads of 0.9.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Let's assume that we know that the probability of actually having a loaded coin is zero.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In which of these cases is the probability of being fair given the flips &lt;0.5.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that apply. Note that 4 H 0 T means four head and zero tails.
