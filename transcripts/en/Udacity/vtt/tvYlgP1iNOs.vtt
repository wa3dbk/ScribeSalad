00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.870
UML also supports packages, in the sense of Java packages.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.861
These are general purpose organizing mechanisms. Before UML 2,

00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:14.107
you could use packages as parts of other diagrams. In UML 2 there was a separate

00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:19.380
package diagram. Essentially this is providing namespace scoping so that each

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.540
package can have its own set of names without worrying about collisions. And

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.190
that there's dependency arrows between two packages if some piece of

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.888
one package has a dependency arrow with some piece of another package. That is,

00:00:32.888 --> 00:00:37.480
it's an abstraction of that particular dependency at, to the package level.
