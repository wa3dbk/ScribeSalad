00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.290
We've looked at multiplying identical bases together, as well as different bases

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.285
together, now let's look at powers of powers. I have a base raised to a power,

00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:12.338
and then that quantity, raised to another power. We're going to try and come up

00:00:12.338 --> 00:00:16.652
with an exponent rule to handle these. This cubed power indicates I should write

00:00:16.652 --> 00:00:21.080
2 cubed multiplied by itself 3 times, so I write that here. Now we can expand

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.159
each of these and write our final answer as two to some power. So what do you

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.001
think that would be? Can you write the expressions with one base and one

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.243
exponent here? Do the same for these problems.
