00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.330
To use scales in D3, you specify the range of your possible input values,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.070
a function that transforms these to output values and

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.220
the appropriate limits on your output range.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.013
Going back to our Gapminder example, one last time, we notice that the x-axis

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:27.068
ranges from around 250 to 100,000, and it's a log scale.

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:34.120
And the y-axis ranges from around 15 to 90 on a linear scale.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.540
To plot our circle using D3 and its scaling functions,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.180
we need to remember that the expectancy is a value of 75.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.600
The y-axis is on a linear scale.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.801
The income per person is 8,347.

00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:53.790
And the x-axis is on a logarithmic scale.
