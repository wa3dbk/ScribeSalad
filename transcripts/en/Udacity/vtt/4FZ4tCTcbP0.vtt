00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's go through it together--the Web page is broken down into words and trees.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That's lexing and parsing, and we do that first.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is right; the Web page is then interpreted--that's True.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Some of the fragments or elements that we come across

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
might be JavaScript--embedded JavaScript--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so then we have to call the JavaScript interpreter.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So thus far, the first 3 seem pretty good.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Eventually, the user's JavaScript code on the Web page

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
may call: write--at which point we'll have to

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
store all of that output so that we can display it on the Web page.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's good.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Ah! But then here we're suggesting that the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
JavaScript interpreter calls the graphics library.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This is an erroneous step; in our particular architecture,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the JavaScript interpreter returns all of the strings to the HTML interpreter

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and that interpreter, then, calls the graphics library.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is what's known as a Design Decision.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
For our particular Web browser,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
only the HTML interpreter is going to call the graphics library.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That's not the only way to do it.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Just like there's more than one way to build a house,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
there's more than one way to build or design a Web browser.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We've just decided for this particular one,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that only the HTML interpreter's going to call the graphics library.

00:01:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I claim that's going to simplify the amount of code we'd have to write.
