00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.250
When thinking about growth for
your app one of the most important

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.040
things is the key flows that you know
your users are going to go through.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.570
Most people who download your app
are not going to come back later.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.220
So you really need to get them to
the wow moment at the beginning

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.210
as soon as possible with your product.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.170
So make them see what the value is so
that they will come back again.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.250
One of the most important things in
A/B testing is also the creative side.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.110
So whilst the process
itself is scientific,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.330
and you want to use math and
data to get to the right decision,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.570
knowing what you can do to move
the metrics that you want to do

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.950
is very much the creative part
that goes at the beginning.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.360
And without that, then you can't do all
of the testing that comes afterwards.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.523
If your user is waiting just
few hundred milliseconds more,

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:45.020
they will use your app less.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.760
It's really important to be creative.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.391
For instance, if your app aBARKment, you
wanted more people to be able to post

00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:54.540
an ad, there are an infinite number
of ways that you can go about it.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.612
For instance, you might want a permanent
entry point on at the same point in

00:00:58.612 --> 00:01:02.687
every single screen in the app to make
sure that people always knew that they

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:06.393
could post an ad and they always knew
where they wanted to go to do it.

00:01:06.393 --> 00:01:10.454
One of the most important things that
any marketer needs to think about with

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:12.950
their Apple product is retention.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.640
So, it's hard to get people to try
out your app for the first time.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.960
And if you're losing
users from your app,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.390
that can make all of your
work that much harder.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.190
It's like having a bucket
with holes in it.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.920
If you're pouring water into the top,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.920
your bucket's not going to get
full if you have that many holes.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.820
So you concentrate on filling those
holes, increasing user retention, and

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.530
then you can get more users in.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.350
When you're trying to measure retention,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.050
if you're storing your own data, you
need to make sure that you store when

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.930
was the first time
that you saw this user.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.520
So what was the date when
they first turned up?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.010
Then you can do what's
called cohort analysis.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.540
And this is just a way of saying for
everyone who installed on a single day,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.870
after that, what was the likelihood that
they came back on any other given day?

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.860
Another thing that app marketers
should really care about

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.740
is the number of people who
are actively using your product.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.880
Too many marketers focus on
just the top of the funnel and

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.250
getting the number of downloads up and
the number of new users in, but if

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.330
they're not actively using the product,
then they're not doing you any good.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.160
So one that Facebook uses is monthly
active users and that's just the number

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.030
of people who have opened and
used your app in the last 30 days.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.500
When you're looking at new user
acquisition, one of the most important

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.810
things is the different sources that
are providing you with new users.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.580
So, for instance,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.530
there's organic downloads where people
are coming direct from the App Store.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.490
Maybe they're searching for
a specific term.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.597
Maybe they're just browsing.

00:02:31.597 --> 00:02:34.092
Other ones include pay channels.

00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:38.550
Facebook, for instance,
does mobile app install ads.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.490
If you go with paid media,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.990
you'll usually get a lot of stats
from the actual tool itself.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.130
So inside of Facebook,
if you pay for ads,

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.170
we'll give you really important
key of metrics, like the reach and

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.290
number of impressions that your ads
are delivering, as well as the number of

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.340
installs that you're getting that's
attributed to that campaign, and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.790
really key metrics like the cost
that you're paying for each install.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.540
For user engagement, there's lots of
different ways that you can look at it.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.490
The specifics will depend
on what your app is and

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.110
which market segment you're in.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.950
The number of times that a user
comes back inside of a month.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.390
The daily active to monthly active
ratio is a good measure of engagement.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.840
And also the number of things
that they do inside of the app.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.410
If you're looking at a shopping app, for

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.810
instance, the number of items that
they view might be a good metric for

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.430
engagement, the specifics all
the way down to the app itself.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.850
One of the most important things
that you can do for growth

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.820
is get people through the new user
experience as quickly as possible and

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.910
into the real wow
moment of your product.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.920
So what is it that really is going to
capture the user's attention?

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.030
What is it about your product
that makes it successful?

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.490
If you have a long sign up flow, you're
going to reduce the number of people

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.350
getting through, and
that's not what you want.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.350
Facebook puts a lot of effort into
its new user registration flow.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.510
So when you go to sign up for
Facebook, we ask you for

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.300
as few pieces of information as we can
so that we can get you to the real point

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.679
of the product and that's seeing all
of the status updates and photos and

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:03.410
things that your friends
are posting in your news feed.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.260
&gt;&gt; The most high level metrics for

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.615
paid social are going to be CPC,
which is cost per click.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:13.960
That's the usual term that ad industry
uses for engagement on your ads.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.880
And what that means is every
click is going to cost

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.350
you a specific amount of money.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.149
It's also important to take into
consideration when you're thinking

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.710
about cost per click and
how much you're going to spend for

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.740
a click potentially to your product or
website, but

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.710
think about the lifetime value or
LTV of that particular customer.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.800
So how much will they
potentially spend long term

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.840
if you're able to acquire
them with one simple ad?

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.340
Certain platforms like Twitter use
CPE which is cost per engagement.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.010
That could be anything that a user
engages with in one of your paid ads.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.150
That could be a favorite,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.040
a retweet, or a direct click
through to your product or website.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.730
Also, just for good measure,
it's good to do some basic research on

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.080
industry standards and industry
baselines for how well ads perform.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.400
So, for example,
if you are developing a fitness app,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.330
do some research on how fitness
industry ads perform on Twitter.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.610
And if you're getting a return or
an engagement of, let's say, 1% on your

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.970
ads, you know that you can compare that
to whatever the industry average is.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.980
There's no perfect way to
find industry averages or

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.130
how well relative industries perform
on specific social platforms.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.630
I'll just say do some Googling,
do some searching, do some research.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.400
You're going to find really helpful
free resources out there and you can at

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.490
least find some baselines to go up and
measure your performance against.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.790
Thinking about a small brand or
a small startup,

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.420
it's really important to
embrace grassroots tactics.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.130
Think constant engagement,
think things like giveaways and

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.200
contests, anything that can move
the needle in the right direction and

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.760
help build your social
media follower base.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.640
It's also important to consider
things like user generated content.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.950
Getting great content from your users,
quotes, anything tactical like that can

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.640
really pay off and
help engage with your customer base.
