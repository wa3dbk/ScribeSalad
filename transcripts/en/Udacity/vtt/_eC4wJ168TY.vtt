00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.070
So, here is my code for the class movie, and behind it, is hidden

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.870
the other programming file, where we have

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.920
defined multiple instances of the class movie, namely

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.710
Toy Story and Avatar. So, what I will do, is go back to my

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.850
code for the class movie, and define

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.543
a new function or method there called, show_trailer.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.530
Now, each instance method, whether it be init

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.740
or show_trailer takes the first argument as, self. So

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.140
I will add that. All, show_trailer has to do,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.480
is open the web browser, with the correct URL.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.940
And the link or the URL, is stored in

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.540
the instance variable. trailer_youtube_url. The way to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.060
access this instance variable, is through the self keyword.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.760
One last thing I need to make this code

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.860
work, is to import web browser. 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.050
There, let me go ahead and save this file. Now that we have defined

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.510
the method, show_trailer. The next thing for us to do, is to call this method,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.130
using our other programming file. So I will go there, and here, I already

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.375
have the instance or object called, Avatar.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.680
So I will use it, Avatar,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.011
to call the show_trailer method. I'm

00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:16.240
going to go ahead and save this file.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.240
And then I will run it.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.211
[MUSIC]

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:33.135
Wow, that was outstanding.
