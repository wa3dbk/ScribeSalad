00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.600
Now, let's go back to
checking out FPS Screens.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.200
In this screen we're doing almost
the exact same thing as in delta screen,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.200
except instead of displaying delta,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.280
we're displaying number of frames per
second which we can get using this

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.400
handy Gdx graphics get
frames per second column.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.010
All right,
let's try running this game and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.710
see how the game slash
screen life cycle works.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.040
So when we start the app,
first the game is created, and

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.580
then we set the actor
screen to be delta screen.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.545
So delta screen was shown and
then resized.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:32.343
Now we set this up so that we can hit
space to switch between the two screens,

00:00:32.343 --> 00:00:33.501
so let's do that now.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.380
When we switch the screens,
delta screen had hide called.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.290
Then FPS screen had show called,
and it was resized.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.370
Also in that process I accidentally
clicked into and out of the screen,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.310
so pause was called and
then resume was called on the screen.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.570
Let's see what happens when
we close out of the game.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.300
When we close out of the game
the active screen is first paused,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.940
then dispose is called on the game which
automatically calls hide on the screen

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.540
that was active.
