00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.200
The main thing to remember about operant conditioning is that reinforcement

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.007
always increases the future likelihood of a behavior occurring, and punishment

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:13.350
always decreases the likelihood of behavior occurring. Let's take a look at

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.150
this two by two table of operant consequences. Notice we have a plus and a

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.355
minus. You should think of this as adding something to the environment or

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:28.384
taking something away. Do not think of the plus and minus as good or bad. But

00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:32.526
rather just a mathematical operation. So we have our operation. Are we adding

00:00:32.526 --> 00:00:36.732
something or subtracting something? On the consequence side, we're going to

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:42.910
either add a reinforcer or remove a reinforcer. Let's think of our example with

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.950
Callie, when Dr Zelegg gave a piece of fish to Callie, she was using that fish

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:56.012
as a reinforcer, and it was an impetative stimulus something that we enjoy. We

00:00:56.012 --> 00:01:01.626
can also increase behavior by removing something aversive. For example, you

00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:06.176
wake up and your alarm clock is blaring loud, that's very aversive. You turn

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:09.952
your alarm clock off, you remove that aversivness from your environment and

00:01:09.952 --> 00:01:15.555
you're likely to engage in that behavior again in the future. Reinforcer is

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:21.710
always increasing behavior. Let's look at punishers. In this box we would call

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.500
this positive reinforcement, because we're adding something to the enviornment.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.750
In this box we call it negative reinforcement because we're taking something

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.294
away. We can also use these operations for punishment. For punisher, if we add

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:38.878
something aversive after a behavior occurs, we're going to see a decrease in

00:01:38.878 --> 00:01:44.080
the likelihood of that behavior occurring in the future. We can also remove

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.207
something positive or appetitive and also see a decrease. So, for example, if

00:01:49.207 --> 00:01:52.684
you touch a light switch with a wet hand and you get shocked, you're adding

00:01:52.684 --> 00:01:58.180
pain to your environment and you probably won't do that again in the future.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.149
Here, you're playing with your video games and you hit your brother and your

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.151
mum takes away your video games. You're losing something that you enjoy and

00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:11.952
you're less likely to engage in that behavior again in the future. So in this

00:02:11.952 --> 00:02:18.220
example, this would be positive punishment because you're adding a punisher.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.559
And in this box, it would be negative punishment because you're taking away

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.686
something that is appetitive or something that we like and we also see a

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:30.781
decrease in behavior. Reinforcement increase, punishment decrease.
