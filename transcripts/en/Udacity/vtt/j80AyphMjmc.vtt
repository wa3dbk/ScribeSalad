00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.656
Now let's move on to another area in the study of social psychology and social

00:00:03.656 --> 00:00:08.270
behavior. And that is the unfortunate bias of prejudice and resulting

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.455
discrimination. Prejudice is a biased attitude toward a group of people or an

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:18.351
individual member of a group based on unfair generalizations about what members

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:24.065
of that group are like. Such prejudicial thinking is often the result of

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:28.493
stereotypes. Instead of resulting from a careful observation of people's

00:00:28.493 --> 00:00:33.026
behavior. If we have a prejudice that is based on race or ethnicity we call

00:00:33.026 --> 00:00:40.590
that racism. Or if we have a prejudice based on the sexes. We call that sexism.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.722
There is a lot of very interesting research, especially in the area of

00:00:43.722 --> 00:00:47.070
industrial organizational psychology, that looks at both prejudice and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.625
discrimination. So, remember that prejudice is a biased attitude. But when that

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:57.895
attitude changes to behavior. We see that discrimination can occur.

00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:02.723
Discrimination is a preferential treatment of certain people usually driven by

00:01:02.723 --> 00:01:09.155
prejudicial attitudes. Psychologists have suggested that prejudice operates

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:13.732
both inside and outside of our awareness. That is, we may be aware of our

00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:19.820
prejudice. But we may also hold a prejudicial view without being aware of it.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.100
Now, how do we know this? And how can we measure it? Two researchers, Banaji

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.240
and Greenwald, suspected that there was a disconnect between people's conscious

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.480
and unconscious views of prejudice. And they developed a very interesting way

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.744
to measure this. Go to the link below in the Instructor's notes section, and

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:40.130
take the test for racism.
