00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.796
So now, we have one factor of f of x equals 4x squared minus 4x plus 1. We know

00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:09.656
that it's 2x minus 1. How can we find the other? Well, we can use long

00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:14.163
division. So, carry out this division using long division. Write your answer in

00:00:14.163 --> 00:00:14.909
this box.
