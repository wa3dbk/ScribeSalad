00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.174
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, the thing about entering these points, is that there are actually a ton

00:00:03.174 --> 00:00:06.527
of different ways you can do it. I simply wanted to give you one method that you

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:09.995
can use that's pretty reliable for creating different fraction slots in ordered

00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:13.303
pairs. So, for our first point, 3 quarters comma negative 1 half, you could, of

00:00:13.303 --> 00:00:17.160
course, use this method that I showed you up here. But you could also just enter

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.431
this from left to right and it should turn out just like this. So, for some

00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:25.537
ordered pairs involving fractions, things aren't really that complicated.

00:00:25.537 --> 00:00:29.785
However, this one right here is a pretty difficult one, I think. If you try, for

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:33.685
example, to enter to everything in here from left to right, here's what you'll

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:37.498
end up with, you open parenthesis and then a 1 comma 2 as a denominator over 7.

00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:41.460
That's definitely not what we want. So here, I think it's easiest if you first

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.036
enter the fraction 2 over 7 then go backwards and write the 1 and the comma.

00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:48.717
Negative 1 over 8 comma 3 is another one that's pretty simple to enter. You can

00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:51.966
also do this from left to right, or you can use the method of inserting

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:55.805
fractions that's where you need them first. So, the moral of the story is, when

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:59.825
your typing things using MathQuill, you always need to be super careful to check

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:03.826
what you're typing and make sure that it's actually what you want to be typing.

00:01:03.826 --> 00:01:07.712
Also, the more practice the better. So, just keep trying things like this out,

00:01:07.712 --> 00:01:08.690
any chance you get.
