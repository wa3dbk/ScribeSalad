00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
My name is Andreas Zeller. I'm a researcher at Saarland University in Germany.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And I am researching large programs and why they fail.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I have done some fail work in automatic debugging, also in mining the histories of programs.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I've been working with companies such as Microsoft, SAP, or Google,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
examined their bugs, finding out what was wrong, and it struck me

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that there's almost no teaching material available on debugging and how to debug programs.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So today, I'm going start with you a course on how to do debugging systematically,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
effectively, and in many cases, even automatically--enjoy.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Welcome to the Udacity course on debugging.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The aim of this course is to teach a systematic approach to debugging

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and we're even going to explore a number of automatic tools that do the debugging for you.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We're going to explore how debuggers work.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
In particular, the scientific method of debugging by which

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
through a series of experiments we gradually refine a hypothesis

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
until we end up with a diagnosis on why the program failed.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
On top of that, we're going to build our own interactive debugger in Python.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
In the next unit, I'm going to introduce you to one of the most

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
powerful debugging tools ever invented, that is assertions.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Assertions are statements in the program that automatically check

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
whether the state of the program is still correct.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That is, while you're program is executing, the computer constantly monitors

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the program on whether a bug has occurred.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This allows you to very quickly and effectively find out where a bug was first introduced.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
On top of that, we're going to build a tool that makes you infer assertions from executions.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In unit 3, I'm going to show you a technique named delta debugging

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
which automatically simplifies problems.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
For instance, here's this 900-line HTML file which causes to crash in a program which processes it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
With delta debugging, you can reduce this to just the eight characters

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that produce the bug just as well and all of this automatically.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
In the next unit, I'm going to show you how to find out where a specific failure came from.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You see an execution as a series of states.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We are going to explore techniques that help you in tracking

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the way of an error all through the program execution.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And on top of that, we're going to build a tool that isolates such cause effect chamge automatically.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In unit 5, we've been looking at reproducing failures.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We're going to look at all the various input sources for your program

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and discuss how to capture and replay them such that you can faithfully

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
reproduce a failure that happens in the field.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Plus, we're going to explore statistical debugging which collects data from the field

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to tell you which parts of your program are most likely to be related to the failure.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
In unit 6, we're going to see how to mine information

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
from bug data bases and change data bases in order to figure out

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
where bugs have been in your program in the past, where they accumulate,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and which parts of your program therefore are going to be the most back prone in the future.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And again this is a fully automatic technique.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
This is so far, you've had no fun in debugging because it just sucks the life out of you.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
The aim of this course is to get most of the debugging effort off your shoulders

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
because you can have the computer take care of most of the debugging work.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So your mind is free for doing something more creative than debugging.
