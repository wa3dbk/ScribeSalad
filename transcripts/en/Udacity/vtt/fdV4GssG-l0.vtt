You've just written a program that contains multiple question types. Over here,

00:00:04.593 --> 00:00:08.848
we have a plain question, over here a choice question. We pass each of them to

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:13.570
the present question method, that method is down here. It has a parameter of

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.167
type question. And now let's focus on this display method here. Notice that q

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:22.844
is of type Question. And I would like you to tell me exactly which display

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:28.258
method is called, in the call q.display. Is it always, the display of the

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:33.170
question class? Is it always the display method of the choice question class?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.748
Does it vary? Is it sometimes question display and sometimes choice question

00:00:36.748 --> 00:00:40.661
display? Or could this call even call some other method, something other than

00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:44.700
question display and choice question display. Let me know what you think.
