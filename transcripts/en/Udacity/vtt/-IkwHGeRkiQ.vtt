00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:04.893
We can think of the independent variable as the input and the dependent variable

00:00:04.893 --> 00:00:09.698
as the output. So in an equation like y equals 3x plus 2, the input would be

00:00:09.698 --> 00:00:14.801
whatever number we plug in for x, and the output is the number that we get for y

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:19.529
by using that value of x. The output depends on the input.
