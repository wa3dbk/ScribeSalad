00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.352
Now, as you can see, keyboard input only allows firing in the cardinal and

00:00:03.352 --> 00:00:08.310
ordinal directions from where the player is, i.e the red and black arrows here.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.095
With this, players using mice as an input would get an unfair advantage. As you

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.155
can see where the cursor is here, a mouse player would be able to shoot in a

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:21.028
direction and at an angle that keyboard players wouldn't be able to use. In

00:00:21.028 --> 00:00:24.450
order to level the playing field, what we do in GRITS is eliminate that

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.167
advantage by snapping the firing vector to one of the eight directions that

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:33.172
keyboard controls allow. So, if you click where the cursor is now, it would go

00:00:33.172 --> 00:00:37.258
along the right-up vector. Each of the shaded regions corresponds to only one

00:00:37.258 --> 00:00:40.610
firing vector. We started out the unit talking about how important it was to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.330
make sure that every player had a fair experience. But an issue is, that mouse

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
players with the current code can actually fire in more directions than

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.455
keyboard players. So, what we need to do is take the actual mouse input and

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:54.770
snap it to one of the eight directions that the keyboards actually have access

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.778
to. In order to do this, we need to do a little bit more trigonometry. Now, in

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:02.898
order to snap the arbitrary directional vector that we're getting from mouse

00:01:02.898 --> 00:01:06.018
input to one of our eight directional values that a keyboard player can use, we

00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:11.090
are going to utilize a lookup table. This lookup table is already populated to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.522
contain the eight directional vectors, unitized, that keyboard players have

00:01:14.522 --> 00:01:19.082
access to. Now, the magic sauce here, is taking this arbitrary directional

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:22.678
vector and turning it into a lookup index that we can then query against the

00:01:22.678 --> 00:01:27.977
lookup table. For us, we have a magical pixie of a function, called

00:01:27.977 --> 00:01:32.153
getQuantizedAngleIndex. Now, I'll spare you most of the math that's inside of

00:01:32.153 --> 00:01:35.938
this function, because really, our intent is not to teach you trigonometry. The

00:01:35.938 --> 00:01:39.578
overview is this, we use the atan2 function to find the angle between the input

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:44.365
directional vector, and the x positive vector. This gives us an angle between

00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:48.354
the two InRadians. We then use some nice fun little tricky math here to scale

00:01:48.354 --> 00:01:53.562
that angle value into an integer between zero and seven. That zero and seven

00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:57.901
value is passed back and used as an index inside of our lookup table. The

00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:01.097
result gives us a directional vector that matches exactly what keyboard players

00:02:01.097 --> 00:02:02.110
can use
