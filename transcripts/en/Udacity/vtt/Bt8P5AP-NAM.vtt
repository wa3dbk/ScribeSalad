00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.918
I decided that I'd like to switch what was on either side of the equation just

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:07.649
because I prefer to have x on the left side of the equation. This is just a

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.775
personal preference. It doesn't change the math that we're doing at all. I also

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:15.303
set y equal to 0 since we are, after all, looking for the roots of this

00:00:15.303 --> 00:00:19.030
equation. Now, what we notice here is that you can actually factor this

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.776
expression on the left. X squared plus 8x plus 16 Is just equal to the quantity

00:00:23.776 --> 00:00:28.595
x plus 4 times the quantity x plus 4 well these two factors are clearly both

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:33.572
going to give us the same root since they are equal to each other, so from this

00:00:33.572 --> 00:00:38.470
we just get one equation x plus 4 equals 0 that needs to be satisfied in order

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.549
for this equation to be satisfied Fine. So we get a root of x equals negative 4.

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:47.626
Now even though we only got one answer here for x, we must notice that the

00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:52.031
factor that this came from appears twice in the equation. So it's not so much

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:56.585
that there's just one solution, it's that the two roots of this parabola happen

00:00:56.585 --> 00:01:00.932
to be identical to one another. In fact this root is so special that it gets a

00:01:00.932 --> 00:01:03.310
special name. It's called a double root.
