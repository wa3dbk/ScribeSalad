Adding every item to the Linear Layout
within the Scroll View,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.900
means that every view we create
sticks around, taking up memory,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.686
even if it's never been seen.

00:00:07.686 --> 00:00:10.752
We want to try and create a way,
that we only need to use,

00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:14.990
as many views as are currently visible
in the screen plus one on either end,

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.230
to make sure we can scroll
without flickering.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.072
To do that, Android uses ListView.

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:21.182
So let's take a closer look at that now.
