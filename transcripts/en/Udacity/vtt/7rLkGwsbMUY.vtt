00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:09.216
Well, let's calculate the range for values that are not considered outliers. So

00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:18.281
Q1 is 49,191, and the interquartile range is 4,944. So that means that Q1 minus

00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:27.088
1.5 times the IQR is 49,191 minus 1.5 times 4944. And this is 41,775, so

00:00:27.088 --> 00:00:38.819
anything less than this number is considered an outlier. We also know that Q3 is

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:50.726
54,135 so Q3 plus 1.5 times the IQR Is 54,135 plus 1.5 times 4,944, and this is

00:00:50.726 --> 00:01:02.460
61,551. So anything between these numbers is not an outlier. Anything less than

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.580
this is an outlier, and anything greater than this is an outlier. So that means

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.615
that statistically these values are outliers, but not $60,000.
