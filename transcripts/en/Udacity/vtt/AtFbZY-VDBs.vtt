00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.030
For this lesson, you'll be focusing on practicing DOM manipulation methods.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.880
You'll start by accessing data about existing nodes and modifying that data.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.220
You'll finish by adding and removing DOM elements.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.040
I won't be covering all of jQuery's methods, but

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.050
most of them follow pretty much the same pattern.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.130
And after these examples,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.610
you won't have any problem tackling additional methods.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.090
This is the jQuery API documentation.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.380
On the left, you can see the main types of jQuery methods.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.210
I want to start by modifying the class attribute, so I'll click on Attributes.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.090
I can see a few methods.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.370
I'll go ahead and start with addClass,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.880
which does pretty much exactly what you think it does.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.010
It adds a specified class to a DOM element.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.080
This black box shows the main function signature, which tells you what to

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.350
pass in as an argument to this method to get it to work properly.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.440
This description is pretty useful.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.650
It looks like this method takes in a string of a class name and

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.760
adds it to selected elements.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.080
So if I passed in blue to this method,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.220
I'd add the blue class to the element with the ID of item.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.615
Inside the black box, you could find different ways of using the method,

00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:14.708
including this one, where you could pass a function to addClass.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.580
Huh, that seems kind of weird.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.450
If I read further though, we see that this function must return a string.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.186
It could be a string of a single class name or

00:01:25.186 --> 00:01:28.389
it could be many class names separated by spaces.

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:32.800
And then below, we have some in-depth discussion and some examples.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.300
That's pretty cool.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.706
In other examples, like .parents, for

00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:40.480
instance, you'll see parameters inside square brackets.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.880
The square brackets mean that the parameter is optional and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.150
the method will work just fine with or without it.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.250
Now that I've walked you through the documentation,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.600
I want you to try parsing some documentation for yourself.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.680
You're going to start by modifying some data in the DOM.
