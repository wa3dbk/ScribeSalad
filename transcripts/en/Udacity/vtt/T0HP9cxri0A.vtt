Okay, Michael, so I pulled up this webpage. We

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.570
will provide a link to it, on our own webpages.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.290
And you'll notice there's a really nice copyright here, and

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.010
this is all free to use. So I'm not, I'm

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.780
not doing anything wrong here. They're going to use Independent Components

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.700
Analysis, as a way of recovering, original sounds. So, here

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.500
you see that I've clicked onto a police car. Somebody

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.900
talking in a commercial and, let's say, this dude here.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.840
And, what it's going to do is it's going to, generate

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.280
sounds from each of these three sources that are all

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.480
independently generated. And, it's going to mix them. So if I

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.900
click on these icons here, of these microphones. See, these

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.590
look just like what I drew before. You'll be

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.727
able to hear each of their sounds combined together. So

00:00:44.727 --> 00:00:48.081
I'm going to put my microphone very close to it so

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:52.066
you can hear it. [SOUND] [FOREIGN] And here is another

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:56.903
one of the microphones. [SOUND]

00:00:56.903 --> 00:01:00.570
[FOREIGN]

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.000
Okay, so, Michael, could you hear that?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.670
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.350
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, what I did is, I played two of the, the, the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.280
mix sounds together. And, you know, to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.910
the untrained ear, they sound very much alike.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.560
But I think the, the most important thing is, all three of these sounds are

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.270
over on top of one another, and as human beings we actually do a pretty

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.140
good job on being able to focus on one of them,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.470
because I don't know, we're designed to do that. But machines have

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.510
historically had a terrible time of doing this. And independent components

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.830
analysis was the first sort of generic algorithm that was able to

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.565
solve this. So, we're going to use ICA now to separate the

00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:36.150
sound sources. And as you see, we get these little gramaphone things.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.940
And I'm going to play, each one of these and see if

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.440
they did a good job of separating those into the original sources.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.190
[FOREIGN] The guardians

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.180
of the electronic stock market NASDAQ

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.026
who have been burned by past ethics questions are. [SOUND] Okay,

00:01:58.026 --> 00:02:02.668
so wasn't that kind of cool

00:02:02.668 --> 00:02:07.480
Michael? I mean we, we took these completely mixed up sounds and

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.370
we were able to recover the original, by using independent components analysis.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.010
&gt;&gt; That's fascinating. I don't still

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.530
understand what it's doing, but its pretty

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.710
neat that it could do that, because it sounded pretty mixed up to me.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.240
&gt;&gt; Well it was, it was in fact each

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.180
one of these three sources, that we eventually heard

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.980
were in fact arbitrarily, linearly, combined into each of

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.620
these separate microphones. And there's really sort of no way

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.830
in which you'd be able to recover the original sounds, because, there's

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.090
no reason for you to be able to do that. But people

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.610
do it all the time. And now with something like independent components

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.440
analysis, you can also do it. And the reason it works with

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.590
independent components analysis. And that fundamental

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.310
assumption that it's making, is that

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.060
whatever is generating in these cases

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.440
these sounds, the sources, are statistically

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.560
independent of one another. Which happens to be true in that case.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.489
And they're combined together in a way that is a linear combination.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.540
Now there's a lot a details here. And again

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.400
when you read the materials you see exactly how independent

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.160
components analysis works. But, intuitively all it's doing is taking

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.010
this particular model, and by using mutual information directly to

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.450
find things that are independent of one another, while

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.200
not losing any information, from the observables, it's able to

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.090
reconstruct these sounds. And it's able to do this incredibly

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.980
quickly, and incredibly well. Under a large number of conditions.
