00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.900
So there's no correct answer to this quiz, of course.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.240
What I'm getting here, is usually between 40 and 60,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.150
sometimes it was between 60 and 100, never much above

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.870
60. So, this is the answer that I'm getting. I

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.550
know some of you are, unfortunately, having much less bandwidth

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.320
from that, and I hope you're still able to get

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.880
the videos okay. If you have less than one kilobit

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.720
per second, unfortunately, you're probably having a really hard time.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.970
And some of you probably live in countries that have much better bandwidth than

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.780
the United States, and are fortunate enough

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.670
to have over 200 megabits per second.
