00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now let's introduce another problem.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We have a cavern here with a rickety bridge connecting it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
On this side, which we'll call "here," we have a collection of 4 people

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
who want to get to the other side, which we'll call "there."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Part of the problem is this is nighttime, and it's dark.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Fortunately, our team has a flashlight or a torch.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The setup is such that the bridge is so rickety that only 2 people at a time

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
can cross, so either one or two people can cross.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's so dark that they need the flash light with them.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
For everybody to get across, two people are going to have to go across.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
One is going to have to come back with the flashlight.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
They'll shuttle each back and forth like that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, each of the people has different physical abilities and fear levels,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
so they each take different times to cross the bridge.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This person is speedy, takes 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes.

00:00:57.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The question is what combinations of actions will get everybody across the bridge the fastest.
