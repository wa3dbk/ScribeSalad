00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So this is my solution to the problem, so let's just go ahead and run through it.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Since clauses is a list of lists,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we're just going to run through each inner list of for clause and clauses.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We're going to set a variable called clause satisfied to false to begin with,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
then for each variable in the clause, if it is positive,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that is if it is not negated than if the assignment to the variable is true,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
then we switch clause satisfied to true and break

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and go to the next variable in the clause.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Else, we go ahead and recognize that the variable is negated

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and we check that the assignment is false,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and if that is the case, then we set

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the clause satisfied to true and break.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Finally, once we are done looping through all the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
variables in the clause we check if clause satisfied is false,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and it is still false,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
then we immediately return false

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
because there is a clause that is not satisfied.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This is simply a shortcut to make the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
algorithm run a little bit faster.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And once we're done with that,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we simply loop back to the next clause and start all over.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And if we fall through all of those,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
then we return true and say, yes,

00:01:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the entire Boolean formula is in fact satisfied by the given assignment.
