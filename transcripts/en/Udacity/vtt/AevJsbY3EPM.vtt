00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.120
We can transform the equation, Y equals X squared plus 5x plus 6. Using

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.576
completing the square, to instead read, y plus 1 over 4 equals x plus 5 over 2

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:15.916
squared. The first step that I do is make sure that what's on the right hand

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:21.042
side isn't already the square of binomial. Which is, if you remember, the form

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:25.023
that we want the right-hand side of the equation to be. You should always check

00:00:25.023 --> 00:00:28.768
this first just to make sure you don't do a ton of unnecessary work. Anyway I

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:32.424
subtract 6 from both sides. Then I figure out what term I need to add on to x

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:36.268
squared plus 5 x to make this the perfect square of two terms added together,

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:37.457
and then I just factor.
