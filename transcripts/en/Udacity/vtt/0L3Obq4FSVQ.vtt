00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.850
Your task was to create three histograms on one output

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.950
plot. And to do that you needed to install the grid

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.960
extra package and load it into RStudio. Once you've got

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.860
that, now it's just a matter of creating each of the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.910
three histograms. And saving them to three variables. I'll use p1,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.130
p2 and p3 for each of the plots that I'm going to

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.290
create. Now the first histogram is the same as before. We

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.610
just have friend_count, pass to x, and pf, pass to data.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.630
For the second histogram, we'll take the log10 of friend_count. And remember

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.930
to add 1 to it first, so that we don't get any

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.760
undefined results. And finally for our third histogram, we'll simply take the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.540
square root of friend count. Now, if I run all these lines

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.530
of code, I can see that I create three new variables that

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.460
saves each of my plots. And now I just need to pass

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.469
each of these plots to grid dot arrange. And set end col

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.360
equal to 1, since I just want one column with all my histograms.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.460
And running my code, I can see that I get all

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.840
three histograms. And here's a closer view of the three. Notice that

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.790
our second plot is much better. Since we have a normalish

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.090
kind of distribution. The square root transform

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.849
is also better than no transformation

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.740
at all, since we don't have as much of a long

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.730
tail. We do still have a long tail, it's just that much

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.070
lower friend count since we transformed the variable. The tilt's just

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.420
not as bad as before. Now there was another way to create

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.120
these same three histograms using a different type of syntax.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.210
Now the syntax is a little more complicated at first. But

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.960
I want to give you a preview right now since you'll

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.480
see it in upcoming lessons. This time, we're going to use

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.470
the ggplot syntax to create our histogram. Ggplot is very

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.090
similar to the q plot function, since it still takes the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.600
same parameters, x and data. The key difference is that we

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.130
need to include any x or y variables inside this aesthetic

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.440
wrapper or AES. The other thing we need to do is

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.860
we need to tell ggplot what type of plot we want to

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.010
create. Or what kind of geom we want. The geom that we

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.590
want is geom histogram. Running this bit of code I can see

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.910
that I get my original histogram. Which is the first one we

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.230
created on friend count. Running the entire line I can save this

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.440
histogram into p1. Now I've got a plot that I can just

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.220
alter using scales. So for the second plot, I'm going to take my

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.380
first plot and just add a scale_x_log10 to it. This

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.620
is going to transform the x-axis, or the x variable, using log

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.970
base 10. Similarly, for the third graph, I'm going to add scale

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.940
x square root. Now, I don't want to use p2 here, since

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.140
I've already got a scale log 10 on it. I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.350
want to use my original graph, p1. And add scale x square

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.170
root. Now saving all these plots and writing our grid dot

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.330
arrange function, we get the same output as we had before.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.285
Now there is a slight difference here based on the

00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:36.720
x-axis labeling. And I want you to see if you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.610
can figure that out. If you're not sure of the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.230
differences, don't worry. I'll explain it in the next video.
