We need to shift the graph down by 10,000, or in other words, the new graph will

00:00:05.068 --> 00:00:09.832
be 10,000 lower than the old graph. This is because Grant's profit, the p

00:00:09.832 --> 00:00:14.967
values, are all the vertical values on the graph will be each 10,000 lower than

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:19.937
they were in the old graph. Let's take a look at this for a second. Here are the

00:00:19.937 --> 00:00:24.739
graphs for our old equation, the one in red. And our new equation, the one in

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.707
blue. And we can see that the blue graph is shifted just below the red one. It's

00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:34.687
shifted down by 10,000. So the p coordinate of every single point along the blue

00:00:34.687 --> 00:00:39.199
curve is 10.000 lower. And the p coordinate of the point with the same c

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.878
coordinate on the red curve. So it looks like changing the constants as final

00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:48.719
terms out here can shift the graph in vertical direction and we have a parabola.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.421
That's pretty interesting.
