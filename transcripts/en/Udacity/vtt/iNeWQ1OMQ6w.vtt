00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.002
If we combine the like terms, we're left with x squared plus 11x plus 30. So,

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:09.162
when we think about this factored form and this expression, is it equal to this

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:14.050
original expression? Well, we know it's not equal. These are two different

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.865
polynomials. This 6 wasn't multiplied by a factor of x plus 5 so we can't say

00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:21.053
that these two things are equal.
