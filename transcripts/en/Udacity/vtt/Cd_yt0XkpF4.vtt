00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.736
Alright, you're done.

00:00:01.736 --> 00:00:03.282
let's take a look at the solution.

00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:05.540
Now we're going to need some TextViews.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.390
First of all let's look 
at our LinearLayout.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.513
It's vertical.

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.696
We're going to want it to be horizontal.

00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:13.450
The next thing we're going to want
are a bunch of TextViews.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.110
let's just drag them in.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.480
Now remember, we had all those ID's 
that were given to us in the last quiz.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.910
The first one is the 
list_item_date_TextView,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.840
and we'll give it some text 
that makes sense

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.650
when we help to layout the layout.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.370
We'll remove this before 
we actually submit it to our project.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.926
And for fun, let's switch to landscape.

00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:37.462
It'll make things a little more legible.

00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:40.140
Also, let's just zoom in a little bit.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.840
Alright, so that's our 
list_item_date_TextView.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.863
Now, right next to that, 
we want another TextView.

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:55.306
Since we want the design to be the same,
this one doesn't need to have an ID.

00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:59.730
If you remember, our design had the date,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.720
followed by a dash, 
followed by the Forecast,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.530
followed by a dash, 
followed by the high,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.940
followed by a slash, 
followed by low.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.980
So this is just going to be a view 
that contains a dash.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.946
And we can even hardcode this in for now.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:21.742
Then we're going to create 
another TextView next to that.

00:01:21.742 --> 00:01:25.420
Our placeholder text 
will be a forecast, like clear.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.398
The ID for this will be 
list_item_forecast_TextView.

00:01:31.398 --> 00:01:33.550
Now we need another TextView.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.986
Once again, this one's
not going to have an ID

00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:37.492
because we don't need it.

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:39.350
And we'll add another dash.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.820
Now we're actually getting 
to the high and low forecasts.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.276
Let's say a high of 23,

00:01:45.276 --> 00:01:48.732
one more plain TextView, 
this one with a slash,

00:01:48.732 --> 00:01:51.770
and once again, with no ID.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.453
And for our high forecast,

00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:57.666
it better be list_item_high_text_view.

00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:00.180
Finally, we'll add 
one more plain TextView.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.646
This one will be for our low,
and of course,

00:02:02.646 --> 00:02:07.812
that means it's going to be
list_item_low_text_view.

00:02:07.812 --> 00:02:11.479
And there we have it,
our multiple TextView Layout.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.470
Now we might want to make this prettier,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.268
but this is a good start, 
and it just plays

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.036
the four fields that we asked for.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.396
They're all part of a LinearLayout.

00:02:19.396 --> 00:02:22.602
Before we actually would submit this,
let's remove the placeholder tags

00:02:22.602 --> 00:02:25.330
for everything except for
the static fields.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.580
We'll also have to remove 
these empty IDs,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.650
it's actually important to understand 
what's going on in these TextViews.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.420
And there we have it, that's what 
your layout should look like,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.936
at least if you want to make
it look almost identical

00:02:36.936 --> 00:02:38.592
to the layout we started out with.

00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:40.240
Of course you can go wild 
with these designs

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.900
and there's a lot you can do 
with the layout editor

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.490
and with different kinds of layouts.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.580
We'll be learning more 
about that in the next lesson.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.840
Alright, we finally get to start 
hooking this up to our UX.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.290
Let's go back to ForecastFragment.
