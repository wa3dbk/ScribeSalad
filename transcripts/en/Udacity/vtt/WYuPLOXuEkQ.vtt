00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.040
To perhaps get you a little more comfortable with looking at first order logic,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.220
we're going to parse this a piece at a time. First,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.929
we are concerned with valid concrete states T. In which all the invariants,

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.350
that is invC corresponds to concrete invariants, hold on that state. Now

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.340
consider the corresponding abstract states and remember the retrieve function.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.370
We can go from the concrete states to the abstract states by using the retrieve

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.159
function. If we are in the abstract state, the corresponding abstract state. And

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.620
we want to execute the abstract operation with arguments, some argument list,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.890
called args here. Then of course, it's preconditioned. Which we've

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.910
indicated with the prefix ERE, on the retrieve state,

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.877
and the arguments must hold. If the abstract precondition does hold, and if

00:00:52.877 --> 00:00:57.868
we have implemented the operation successfully. Then the concrete precondition,

00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:04.010
which has the, uses the Q version on the concrete state t, must also hold.
