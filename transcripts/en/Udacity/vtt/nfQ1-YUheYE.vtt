00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.476
For the perimeter, we want to use the fact that we can enclose the garden with

00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:09.306
36 feet of fencing. This means that the distance around our garden would be 36

00:00:09.306 --> 00:00:16.160
feet. So that's the perimeter. We know that 36 would equal 2l plus 2w. We have

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.680
two lengths and then two widths. The other piece of information we know is that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.945
the garden is 72 square feet. That's the space we need to plant all of our

00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:32.427
vegetables. So, this area inside in the green. So we know 72 would equal the

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:37.170
length times the width. This would be how we find the area, the product of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.690
these two dimensions. Excellent work if you found these two equations.
