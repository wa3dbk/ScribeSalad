00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.884
We need to formalize how we will precisely measure each type of variability. We

00:00:05.884 --> 00:00:10.483
already decided that we're going to use the grand mean, and use the same idea

00:00:10.483 --> 00:00:17.143
as standard deviation to measure the spread of the sample means. We'll find

00:00:17.143 --> 00:00:22.687
each square deviation from the mean. And in this case we're going to multiply

00:00:22.687 --> 00:00:28.717
each square deviation by the sample size. Each square deviation is equivalent

00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:34.283
to the area of each of these squares. And then we'll mulitiply this area by

00:00:34.283 --> 00:00:40.482
their respective sample size. Here K represents the number of samples. That

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:45.834
means we'll have K sample means. And then we'll add them all up. In this lesson

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:51.244
though, we're assuming that all samples have the same size. So, we can get rid

00:00:51.244 --> 00:00:56.556
of the K. n is just a constant across all samples. That means that we can write

00:00:56.556 --> 00:01:02.012
the numerator between group variability like this. And then we divide by the

00:01:02.012 --> 00:01:07.015
degrees of freedom. When we say formal way of measuring something, that means

00:01:07.015 --> 00:01:12.334
we get one number. If we add up each squared deviation of each sample mean from

00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:16.754
the grand mean, multiply this by the sample size and then divide by the degrees

00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:24.016
of freedom. We get one number that describes between group variability. We need

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:28.826
to do the same for within group variability. And we'll do something similar to

00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:33.742
the way we measured between group variability. We'll take the sum of squares

00:01:33.742 --> 00:01:37.837
for each individual sample from the mean of each sample, and then we'll divide

00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:43.328
by the degrees of freedom. What do you think the degrees of freedom is in this

00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:48.186
case? Let's say that we have three samples. More than one option may be

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:49.096
correct.
