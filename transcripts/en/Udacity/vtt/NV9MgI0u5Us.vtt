If we want to play a video game or design a new tennis shoe, or try out

00:00:03.228 --> 00:00:07.047
different color paints on a building, we would ideally like the experience to be

00:00:07.047 --> 00:00:10.377
interactive. When we take an action we would like to see response from the

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:14.472
computer quickly enough that we don't feel slowed down. How fast is fast enough?

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:18.681
I'll give you a real number. It's about six frames per second. Let me show you.

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:23.165
So in this demo we're showing six frames per second for this frame right here.

00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:27.335
And I can adjust that and make it look slower. So, now it's just going to update

00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:31.230
at one frame per second and you can see that that's, that's pretty unusable.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.154
It's sort of like you're trying to walk through molasses or something. And

00:00:34.154 --> 00:00:38.561
you'll see up in the upper left hand corner how long each frame is taking. So if

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:42.684
I adjust it to say, somewhere around 19 or so. Now it's pretty good, you can

00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:47.576
still see some jerkiness. But if I go to sixty, it becomes nice and smooth. So

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:48.853
now try it for yourself.
