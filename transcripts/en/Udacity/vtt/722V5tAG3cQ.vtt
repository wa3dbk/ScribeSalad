00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.370
Here's an example of a study that Dr Laraway did. He looked at the relationship

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.860
between religiosity and self-esteem, as the two predictor variables, with the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.350
number of days in the last month that college students reported drinking

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.870
alcohol. Just for some definitions, religiosity refers to a person's overall

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.710
level of religious feelings, practices and attitudes. Self esteem refers to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.175
what extent a person feels that he or she if valuable, good or worthy. Higher

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:35.145
scores for these two predictor variables indicate higher levels of these

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:41.399
characteristics. His sample included 203 participants. When doctor Laraway did

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.830
the regression, he got that the y intercept was 2.763. This tells us the

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.520
predicted number of days that the participants used alcohol in the last month,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.440
when their self esteem and religiosity were both zero. Here are the regression

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.620
coefficients that he got. Based on these, fill in the blanks. Each of these

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.920
blanks are numbers multiplied by the variable.
