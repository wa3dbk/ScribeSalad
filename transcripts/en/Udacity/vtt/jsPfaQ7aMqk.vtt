00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.469
We've talked about how to create particles and some of the effects achievable.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.172
You can create all sorts of animations with particle systems. Here's an

00:00:07.172 --> 00:00:10.406
abstract presentation by AlteredQualia, which includes varying the sizes of

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:14.765
particles over time. Objects can also be formed out of particles. In this demo,

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:17.555
the models are represented by particles instead of wire frame triangles,

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:23.020
allowing interesting transformations to occur. Sets of particles can be used

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.900
for all sorts of animations, such as this one with a firework emitting sparks

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.410
as it goes. By overlapping particles, you can get fuzzy effects. Of course, you

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.631
can always make fireworks themselves. Here's how animators preview some

00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:38.494
effects. Particle systems are often set up with guidelines either fixed or with

00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:42.010
some randomness. Rules include elements such as when are particles created,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.336
what path it travels and whether it disappears after a certain duration. The

00:00:46.336 --> 00:00:49.024
path could be hand-animated or controlled by the laws of physics or even a bit

00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:53.176
of both. Another common use is to have large collections of particles simulate

00:00:53.176 --> 00:00:56.660
smoke, water or other phenomena. Here, particles are shown with a fountain

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.988
effect. The particles don't have to be small, they can be objects in their own

00:01:00.988 --> 00:01:06.070
right, such as these dandelion seeds being blown away by the wind. We can also

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.430
create particles that are random 3D fragments, which act as if they're

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.602
generated from a collision. Even effects such as sparkling logos can be done by

00:01:12.602 --> 00:01:16.337
animating particles. Here's the preview followed by the final offline

00:01:16.337 --> 00:01:21.770
rendering. Or you can simply use procedural methods to create amazing scenes.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.054
It still astounds me how many particles you can animate and render at once. In

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:29.538
this demo by AlteredQualia, there are 150,000 rotating 3D cubes being thrown at

00:01:29.538 --> 00:01:34.960
the screen and I'm getting a frame rate of 28 frames per second. The whole

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.755
particle system, evolution itself, creation, movement, and extinction, can now

00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:42.814
even be calculated entirely on newer GPUs. This allows more elaborate

00:01:42.814 --> 00:01:45.550
animations while also freeing up the CPU for other work.
