00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.110
Let's discuss more about
the Bayesian Detection Rate.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.910
We can use the base
theorem to expand this.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.040
And we got this formula here P(I) is
the prior probability of attacks.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.440
Meaning this is the probability of
intrusion evidences in the data.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.180
An intuitive example is that on
a typical day, what's the percentage

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.550
of packets that contain intrusion
activities in our network.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.250
There's an interesting phenomenon
about Bayesian detection rate

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.360
called the base-rate fallacy.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.050
Even if the false alarm rate is very
low, as long as it is not zero, then

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.700
the Bayesian detection rate is still low
even if the base rate is also very low.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.130
For example,
using the formula in the previous slide,

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.140
if we plug in these numbers,
meaning the detachment rate is 100%,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.765
false alarm rate is 10 to the -5,
and the base rate is

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:59.140
2 times 10 to the -5, then
the Bayesian Detection Rate is only 66%.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.560
In other words, one-third of the time
when the ideas produces an alert,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.510
there is no intrusion.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.785
If you look at these
numbers more carefully,

00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:10.720
100% detection rate is perfect.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.930
False alarm rate of 10
to the -5 is also great.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.230
This is not 0, but is very, very low.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.620
So you may ask,
is this low base rate realistic?

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.310
This is 2 x 10 to the -5.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.430
It depends on where do you
measure the base rate.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.700
For example, if you measure base rate at
the network packet level meaning that,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.930
the number of packets that
contain intrusion activities

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.520
which can be hundreds or thousands to
a total number of packets in the network

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.190
which can be tens and
hundreds of millions.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.722
Then this base-rate can
be quite realistic.

00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:49.250
So the base-rate falicy says that, as
long as the false alarm rates' not zero,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.920
then when the IDS produces an alert

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.530
the probability that an intrusion
has actually occurred is also low.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.000
So how do we address this problem?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.230
We can reduce the false alarm rate
to be zero, or as much as possible.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.400
In fact, that's what the vendors
of IDS have been trying to do.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.300
Or we can deploy the IDS
to the appropriate layer so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.380
that, at that layer,
the base rate is sufficiently high.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.000
Modern day ideas use a heirarchal
architecture to achieve this.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.520
We can also use multiple
independent models.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.380
This is similar to medical diagnosis
where multiple tests are used to

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.500
reduce the overall false positive rate
and increase the base indication rate.
