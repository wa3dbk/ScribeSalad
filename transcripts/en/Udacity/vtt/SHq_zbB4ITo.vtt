00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.890
Now you might be asking yourself what's the difference between something like

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.210
exploratory data analysis and data visualization.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.990
In the previous diagram I drew a pretty big distinction between the two, but

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.730
to students new to visualization, they can often seem very similar.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.890
Chris, how would you describe the difference between EDA and

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.760
something like data visualization?

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah I think of it as the difference between notes and lecture.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.720
It is a conversation between yourself and the data.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.830
While data visualization is a conversation between data and your audience.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think Kathy O'Neil puts it

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.160
really well in her book Doing Data Science.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.310
She says that EDA is what happens between you and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.429
your data when you're not trying to do prove anything to anyone yet.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.510
When I get a piece of data,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.190
the first thing I do is make some basic plots, scatter plots, histograms and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.310
things like that, and it's important for a variety of reasons.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.940
Let's look at one now.
