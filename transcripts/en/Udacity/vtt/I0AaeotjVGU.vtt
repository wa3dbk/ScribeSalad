00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The architecture originally looked something like this
--we basically had one machine

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that we were renting from this company--I'm not even
going to mention their name, they're so bad.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'll try to only mention companies I like.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But we are renting one machine and let's 
basically ran this, and this is all of Reddit.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We're also running post quiz on this 
machine and that was it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We didn't have any fancy caching. 
I just used in-memory hash tables.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The database had a fairly guessable structure.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We had a table for links, we had a table for votes, 
and a table for users.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That may have been it to begin with. 
There wasn't a whole lot to Reddit.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We didn't have any comments for a long while, 
and the links and votes tables

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
were basically kind of as I represented them in this lecture.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
These had things like score, title, URL. 
Vote basically had a length ID, a direction.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
User had a name and a password.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Notice I didn't say password hash--
I actually stored the password

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and told you that story how I'd gotten 
trouble as a result of doing that.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We actually did a lot of joins--this lasted 
probably about for 6 months or so.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
After 6 months, we hired a couple guys
--well, we kind of merged our company

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
with another company called Infogami 
and that brought us another engineer

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
named Aaron Swartz and we hired Chris Slowe 
who was doing a PHD at the time.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So the four of us--me, Alexis, Aaron and Chris--
worked on Reddit then.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And the first change that Aaron and I made together was

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
we reroute Reddit from Lisp to Python.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And then at about the same time, we pulled 
the database out of that one machine

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.492
and put it on the second machine, 
and so now we had two machines

00:01:14.492 --> 00:01:17.000
with this hosting company--our app server and our DB.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And the switch from Lisp to Python 
was kind of performance agnostic.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Lisp was a faster language but our 
rewrite of Python was better,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
so the code actually run at about the same speed.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Going from one machine to two machines gave us something on the order of 4x speed improvement.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Remember how I talked in the last lecture about 
separation of services--separating our app server

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
from our database gave us a tremendous 
speed improvement because these two

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
pieces of software run totally different
--use computers in a totally different way.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
That was the first architecture change we made.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I think we upgraded this machine once or twice 
to like a more beefy machine.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
At the time we are still plagued by downtime, 
whether it was our Lisp or a Python program,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
it would occasionally just crash and we'd have to get notified--more often I'd just get called.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I would check the site or somebody would call me 
to tell me the site was down and I'd bring it back up.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
There's so many easy ways to avoid this scenario.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It makes me cringe when I think about how much 
time and stress I spent on

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
not knowing whether our website was running.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The way we do it now is we use a 
piece of software called Supervise,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
which we integrated shortly thereafter. Basically what supervise does is that it watches a program.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It runs a program, and if that program crashes, 
it restarts it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And that's really a nice setup to have, and we actually got to the point where we'd run

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
two Python programs on one machine and 
then we had a little mini load balancer

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
kind of running on that machine as well that would 
send traffic to both of these Pythons

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and if one of them died, Supervisor bring it back up.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And so unless the whole machine died--luckily, 
it never actually happened to us.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
On the website would stay running. At that time, we still 
only had one database machine.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We were very lucky, and we're very lucky that 
neither of these machines ever died

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Because if you lost this machine, the website would 
have been down until we could get a new one,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and our hosting provider was very slow--it would've 
been very difficult.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And if we had lost this one, our database machine, 
we would've lost the data--like forever.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We weren't doing good backups back then and 
it was really fortunate that Reddit turned into a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
popular thing, and it's really cool that 
we still have those archived

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
as a result of luck that we didn't lose those 
because you will lose machines.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Machines die all the time. This is kind of a fact of life.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I mean you're running these machines around 
the clock, high load, hard disk can fell,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
memory can fell--there's lots of things that can go wrong

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
if you use a machine constantly on high load.
