00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.151
So, actually only two of these are true. A function maps each element of its

00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:09.212
domain to exactly one element of its range. And a function also can be seen as a

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:13.853
relation between a set of inputs and a set of outputs. However, none of the

00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:18.222
other three choices are true. Let's look at the first one. If we had checked

00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:23.292
this one off, we will be arguing that a function maps each element of the domain

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:28.040
to at least one element of the range. Now, think back to that soda machine

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.279
example. The soda machine operated like the function, because for any amount of

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.183
money you put in, there's only one option for the amount of soda that you could

00:00:36.183 --> 00:00:39.973
get out. Functions work like beautiful machines in the same way. They're

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:44.844
deterministic. A single input can only lead to one single output. So, the second

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:48.224
one must be right instead of the first one. Now, we know that this last choice

00:00:48.224 --> 00:00:52.046
isn't true. Because there are some equations with two variables that aren't

00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:55.676
functions and we haven't delved super deep into this. But you already know that

00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:59.484
there has to be a special relationship between those two variables, namely, this

00:00:59.484 --> 00:01:03.939
one. That the independent variable can only map to one value of the dependent

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:08.519
variable, and not all equations with two variables do that. For example, we

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:13.712
might have x equals y squared, which is a horizontal parabola. Or we might have

00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:17.520
x squared plus y squared equals 4, which gives us a circle. Neither of these

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.670
passed the vertical line test, which we talked about before, so they're not

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.820
functions. And they don't pass the vertical line test because they don't meet

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.056
this criteria. And finally, if we said that functions must have a defined value

00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:32.272
for any real numbers input, then we would be saying that the domain of every

00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:36.614
single function has to be all the real numbers and that's just not the case. We

00:01:36.614 --> 00:01:40.134
talked about two different major types of domain restrictions that prevent

00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:44.020
certain real numbers from being within the domains of certain functions. We'll

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.150
talk about even more of these cases later on. You just have to wait a couple of

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.663
weeks for some really, really exciting stuff. I know the past couple of lessons

00:01:51.663 --> 00:01:54.750
have required a pretty major paradigm shift in terms of the way that we think

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.984
about the relationship of variables to one another, and what equations really

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:01.594
are. But I hope that you've found our work with functions interesting, and I

00:02:01.594 --> 00:02:04.842
think that it will prove more and more helpful as we continue to use the

00:02:04.842 --> 00:02:08.258
function paradigm in our problem solving especially in our setting up of

00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:09.839
equations. Great job.
