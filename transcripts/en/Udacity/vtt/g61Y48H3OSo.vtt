00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.820
Here are each of the answers. Great work if you figured those out. We want to

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.430
make sure that when we multiply, we just multiply the numbers inside of the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.188
radical, and we leave the index alone. So we have the square root of 5 times

00:00:12.188 --> 00:00:16.955
the square root of 7, which equals the square root of 35. Here, we just

00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:21.824
multiply the radicands of 3 and 12 to get the cubed root of 36. Be sure you

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:25.912
listed the 3 as the index for your radical. For the third one, we have the 5th

00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:30.961
root of 100, since 5 times 20 equals 100. And for the last one, we have the 4th

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.678
root of 21, since 3 times 7 equals 21.
