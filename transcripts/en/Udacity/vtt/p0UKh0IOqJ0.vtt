Now, what does this continue command actually do?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What happens if we set a stepping variable to false?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Is it the program resumes until it exits, the program resumes until the next breakpoint is reached,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the program resumes until the next function is called, or does the program stay in the same line?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Keep in mind that all of these options assume that we return true in our program.
