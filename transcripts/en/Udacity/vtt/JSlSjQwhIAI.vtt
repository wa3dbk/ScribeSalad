00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:06.022
Well you see that there are 3 samples of size 2 that will have an average of 3,

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:12.036
and 2 samples of size 2 that will have an average of 3.5, and 1 sample of size 2

00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:18.944
that will have an average of 4. So 3 plus 2 plus 1 divided by the total number

00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:26.944
of possible means, which is 16, will give us the probability and this is .375.
