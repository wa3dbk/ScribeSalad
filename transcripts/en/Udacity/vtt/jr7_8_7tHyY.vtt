Alright, for this quiz, I want you to find the value of a triangle minus a

00:00:03.775 --> 00:00:07.921
circle. Let me give you the value of the circle. A circle has the value of 5, so

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:11.970
is the answer negative 5, 0, 1, 5 something else, or it's impossible to know.

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:16.078
This quiz is a bit tricky, so take your time and think about the value of each

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.398
shape.
