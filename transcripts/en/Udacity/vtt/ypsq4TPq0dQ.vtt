00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.500
Now that we've done one together, I want you to try this one on your own.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.080
Notice how we have a constant term on this side of inequality. Well, we really

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.204
don't want this over here. We want to set our quadratic equal to 0 first. What

00:00:13.204 --> 00:00:16.880
do you think you'll need to do first in order to get started? Once you've

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.432
gotten that first step, I want you to try and solve for all the possible

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:24.664
solutions. Write your answer as a solution set in interval notation here. And

00:00:24.664 --> 00:00:25.530
good luck.
