00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.929
To send Marla's record to Dr. Jones, Dr.

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:11.278
Johnson uses the direct service
provided by his state HIE.

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:17.420
This simplified and somewhat futuristic
diagram explains how that could work.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.220
Here Marla's record has a share button.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.670
That's not quite available yet but some
EMR vendors are working on integrating

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.110
direct into their workflow so
it may appear in the future.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.180
Doctor Johnson clicks it and

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.320
selects Doctor Jones from
a list of his usual referrals.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.180
If needed he could could look up a new
physician in a directory provided by

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.190
the direct server called a Health ISP or
HISP.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.620
Here, for simplicity,
we're assuming that Doctor Johnson and

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.320
Doctor Jones are using the same HISP.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.480
Before physicians are listed,
their identities and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.780
qualifications are verified, and they're
assigned a special direct email address.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.970
This establishes trust so Dr.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.130
Johnson knows the email
will only go to Dr. Jones.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.140
The form of the record can be
whatever Dr. Johnson chooses.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.576
It could be a scan of a paper record or

00:01:13.576 --> 00:01:19.840
it could be a special XML formatted
patient summary specified under VDT.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.610
In any case, the record is encrypted and
attached to a secure email.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.160
This establishes security so the
information can't be viewed in transit,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.280
a key requirement for
health information exchange.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.600
Privacy was taken care of when Marla
consented to sharing of her record

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.230
with other physicians
involved in her care.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.990
If you've ever signed a HIPAA release
in your doctor's waiting room,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.467
you agreed to this.

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:48.667
Dr. Jones gets the email
in her direct inbox and

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:53.746
can review the record if it's a PDF or
paper scan.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:58.470
If it is in a special XML format called
a Continuity of Care Document or

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.730
CCD, the record could be parsed and

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.216
put right into Marla's chart in Dr.
Jones's office as shown here.

00:02:07.216 --> 00:02:10.410
Parsing it and merging it into
an existing record is yet

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.620
another futuristic
component of this diagram.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.260
Note that the encryption and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.120
decryption of Marla's record is
done using public key encryption.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.470
We'll look at how that
works in lesson four.
