00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.979
Here are some cakes. Notice that for this first chocolate cake, I've split it up

00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:10.102
into thirds or 3 equal pieces. I have 1/3 of it covered in strawberry icing. For

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:14.030
the second cake, I have half of it covered in vanilla icing, 1/2.

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:18.448
But I don't have two separate cakes here, I just have one cake covered in all

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.778
that frosting. So, here's what these pieces would like together on one cake. So,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.738
I have half of it covered in vanilla and a third of it covered in strawberry. If

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.466
I compare the frosted part to the 2/5 part, I can easily see that this is more

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:38.407
than 2/5. So, if you said more than 2/5, nice work. It's not that obvious but if

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:42.871
you draw diagrams, it can definitely help support your reasoning.

00:00:42.872 --> 00:00:47.526
So, let's try looking at this with some math. I had half of the cake in vanilla

00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:52.117
icing and a third of the cake in strawberry icing. Many students think that

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.837
adding fractions together is the same as adding numbers or integers together.

00:00:56.942 --> 00:01:01.485
They would say 1 plus 1 makes 2 and 2 plus 3 makes 5. Many students think 1/2

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:07.017
and 1/3 is 2/5. But when I look at my diagram, I know that can't be right. I

00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:11.407
already have half of the cake in vanilla icing and a little bit more in

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:16.129
strawberry icing. I know this much is frosted and that's way bigger than 2/5.

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:20.644
So, we need another way to add these fractions together. This won't work.
