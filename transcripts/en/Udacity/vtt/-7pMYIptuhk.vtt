00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.987
Mipmapping looks much better, but goes to grey up the horizon. Modern GPUs can

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:08.713
do even better than this by using anisotropic sampling. Anisotropic means

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:11.353
having a property that has a different value when measured in different

00:00:11.353 --> 00:00:15.514
directions. Sampling means retrieving some piece of information meant to

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:19.536
represent the whole. For example, a fragment shader will take a sample from a

00:00:19.536 --> 00:00:23.975
textures mipmap pyramid to represent the texture's color at that pixel. Where

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:26.435
the word anisotropic comes into play is when we get to these pixels on the

00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:30.873
horizon. Think about looking along one column of the checkerboard. At the

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:34.179
horizon a pixel may cover a large number of texels vertically, but few

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.260
horizontally. That is, the number of texels differs in different directions.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.416
What anisotropic sampling does is take extra samples along the axis where

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:47.163
texels are more frequent and blends these together. These extra samples

00:00:47.163 --> 00:00:52.049
generally give a better result, not blurring out as quickly as the mipmap does.
