00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.030
The third advanced feature of ACME is what's called its open semantic framework.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.310
ACME has a simple vocabulary, a simple syntax, and also,

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.230
a very simple semantics, but there obviously could be lots of

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.460
information you'd like to encode in an architectural description.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.950
And, encoding all that complexity you would like to also have some way

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.140
of checking it for whether it's valid.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.560
ACME itself and the ACME tools don't provide that checking, but

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.450
they do provide a way for you to essentially export your

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.590
description in such a way that it can used, be used by external checking tools.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.860
That's what the open semantic framework is.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.510
In particular, the description that you've either drawn, using ACME Studio,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.700
or you've typed in, using the editor,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.330
can be used to generate a description in first order logic.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.290
That description can then be used by an external tool,

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.480
which takes as input the first order logic.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.750
And proves whatever it needs to do, such, such, for

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.920
example that the particular architecture you've described obey's certain rules.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.780
There's an example here for the client server situation.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.450
And it's essentially a an English language keyword version of first order logic.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.680
It says that there exists a thing called client, a thing called server,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.270
a thing called RPC such that client is a component, server is a component,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.060
RPC is a connector, and that they're attached in a way we've described.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.300
This, this contains exactly the information we saw in the ACME description.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.460
But now it's in a form that can be dealt with by a fair improver, or

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.550
automatic reasoning system.
