00:00:00.902 --> 00:00:02.719
Alright, so let's take a moment to have a quiz where we

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.939
really delve deeply into what it means to have a best attribute.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.880
So something Michael and I have been throwing around that term, let's

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.380
see if we can define it a little bit more crisply. So,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.430
what you have in front of you are three different attributes that

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.740
we might apply in our decision tree for sorting out our instances.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.550
So, at the top of the screen what you have is you

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.120
have a cloud of instances. They are labelled either with red x or

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.180
a green o, and that represents the label so that means

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.955
that they are part of our training set, so this is what

00:00:32.955 --> 00:00:36.710
we're using to build and to learn our Decision Tree. So,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.278
in the first case you have the set of instances being sorted

00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:43.390
into two piles. There are some xs and some os on

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.020
the left and some xs and some os on the right. And

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.560
the second case you have that same set of data being

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.240
sorted so that all of it goes to the left and none

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.320
of it goes to the right. And in the third case you have that same set of

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.350
data that's sorted so that a bunch of the xs end up on the left and a

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.000
bunch of the os end up on the right. What I want you to do is to rank each one,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.650
where one is the best and three is the least best attribute to choose. Go.
