00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.900
There are only three basic primitives we ever send to the graphics processing

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.856
unit, points, line segments and triangles. Of these, triangles are by far the

00:00:09.856 --> 00:00:13.874
most important. For example, just about everything you see in a 3D game is

00:00:13.874 --> 00:00:17.560
ultimately made of triangles. Sometimes it's obvious where the triangles are

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.622
used, such as in Minecraft. Sometimes it's not, as in this shot from battlefield

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:26.995
3, captured by Duncan Harris at dead end thrills. We're going to touch on points

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:31.287
and lines only briefly so we can focus on triangles. Defining a point is simple,

00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:39.543
you just specify a 3D location. For example, this point is at 0.4 in x, 0.2 in y

00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:44.070
and 0.0 in z. By the way for all these examples I'm going to make the z values 0

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.453
but it can certainly have a different value. In 3D computer graphics you tend to

00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:53.108
set all three coordinates x, y, and z even if you are mostly working in 2D. By

00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:57.211
defining a second point we can create a line segment. The order of the points

00:00:57.211 --> 00:00:58.323
does not matter.
