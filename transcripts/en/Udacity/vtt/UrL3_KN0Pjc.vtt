Let's do something that isn't quite correct semantically but we can do anyhow.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Suppose the null hypothesis is 73,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and with a two-sided test, using a 95% confidence threshold

00:00:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
would we accept or reject the null hypothesis? Just pick one.
