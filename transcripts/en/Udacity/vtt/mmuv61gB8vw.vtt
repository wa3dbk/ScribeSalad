00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.840
This tells us pretty much the same thing that we get when we do a hypothesis

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.690
test for r. If the test for r is significant, then the test for slope will also

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.120
be significant. This is because both tests ask the same general question. Are

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.550
the two variables linearly related? So, let's just explore this a little more.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.370
And that'll also give you a little review of the hypothesis test for r. I've

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.040
briefly mentioned that beta 1 is how we typically symbolize the population

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.790
slope. And beta not is how we typically symbolize the population, y intercept.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.470
In other words, when we do linear aggression with all the population data, we

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.710
get that the best fit line intercepts the Y axis at beta not. Remember that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.670
lower case B is the slop of the best fit line when we do linear aggression for

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.840
this sample. And we're using a for the y intercept for this sample. Now what do

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.580
you thing the null and alternative hypothesis are, when we do hypothesis

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.420
testing for slope? Do you think it's this group, this group, this group, or

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.080
this group?
