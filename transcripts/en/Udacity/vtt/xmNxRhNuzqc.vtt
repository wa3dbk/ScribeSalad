In order to support all of these related types of entities, we need to ask

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.994
ourselves what properties do we want all entities to support? Does an entity

00:00:07.994 --> 00:00:12.310
need to keep track of its position in the world? To know when it's time to die?

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.994
To think or be able to do something each tick? To know what sounds to play? Or

00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:22.460
post to your Google Plus Stream? Please check all that apply for all entities.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.764
Note, we're not just talking about one entity, we're talking about all

00:00:25.764 --> 00:00:26.940
entities.
