00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In Python, we can write a comment that extends to the end of the line

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
by prefacing it with the # sign or the pound sign or the hash sign.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
JavaScript has this same idea, but instead

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the comments start with // and then continue to the end of the line.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This time I'll write the rule for you.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Here's a rule corresponding to comments that go to the end

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
of the line in JavaScript.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They start with a slash and then another slash,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and then you can have anything that's not our special newline character,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
as many of those as you want, and the maximal munch rule

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
means we're going to eat up all of those characters that we possibly can.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And then rather than returning that as a token, we throw it away

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
because it's a comment, documentation for the user.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Let's test our knowledge of this rule with a quiz.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I've written out 4 sequences of input,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and I'd like you to indicate which of these 4 sequences would yield

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
identifier, identifier, number

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
given the rules we've been talking about for JavaScript.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You've seen how we define identifiers, how we define numbers,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and what starts an end of line comment.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Here are 4 different lines.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Which ones give us identifier, identifier, number?
