00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.450
Compute a histogram of city distances from Denver.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.020
For every city you would compute its distance from Denver.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.100
And you would build a histogram using the techniques that you've already studied.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.439
And so, a histogram is essentially a binning operation, right?

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.138
In this case it's binning on distance, the 1-dimensional quantity of distance.

00:00:16.138 --> 00:00:22.542
And so although you would use a binning step in the process of creating that histogram,

00:00:22.558 --> 00:00:28.327
it really wouldn't be using the geographic binning that we discussed, the sort of 2-dimensional geographic

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:34.638
binning that we used to accelerate our computation of which cities were within 300 kilometers of each other.

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:37.922
And so, I would answer this no--I would say that

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:42.038
it's not useful to use that geographic binning to compute a histogram of city distances,

00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:45.649
even though this is still a geographic problem and a binning problem.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.245
On the other hand, if you have a list of roads and each road is a list

00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:55.434
of line segments, you could easily imagine launching a thread per road or a thread per line segment

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:58.322
and using that geographic binning operation to compute

00:00:58.322 --> 00:01:03.419
which bins, which tiles, which of the grid cells, that line segment intersects,

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:07.490
and computing the population of all cities within that grid cell or nearby grid cell.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.244
So yes, a geographic binning operation like we described would accelerate this kind of operation.

00:01:13.244 --> 00:01:14.939
And, finally, here's a step where the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.033
geographic binning is simply unnecessary work.

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:21.710
If we have a list of counties, and we have a list of cities that have already got a pointer to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.473
containing county that the city is in, then to compute the city-dwelling

00:01:26.473 --> 00:01:32.347
population of all the counties is simply a matter of having every city update its county.

00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:38.276
So one of the points I wanted to make here is that, in fact, every city is in, at most, one county.

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:42.295
And so you already sort of have a bin, a binning in some sense.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.089
The counties sort of provide a binning.

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:48.571
So even though this isn't a geographic or spatial data structure, this index of

00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:51.754
counties and pointers from cities to counties kind of gives you a binning

00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:55.282
And so It would be redundant to apply an additional binning step in this case.

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:58.908
So once again, this one is not really going to benefit from the

00:01:58.908 --> 00:02:01.923
geographic binning operation that we described.
