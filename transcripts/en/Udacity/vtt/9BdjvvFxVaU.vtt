00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.350
So LibGDX provides us a with a way to
talk to the GPU without needing to

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.500
actually use OpenGL.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.300
LibGDX also provides
us with a rectangular

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.420
area of the screen we can draw to.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.960
On a mobile device that's
generally the entire screen.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.610
Now we need to thing about how we're
going to position stuff on that screen.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.068
We clearly need an x, y pair.

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:25.886
And the easiest way to position stuff is
by having the x value be the number of

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:28.128
pixels from the left edge of the screen,
and

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:31.660
have the y value be the number of
pixels from the bottom of the screen.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.270
That's the approach we
are going to stick with for

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.040
the rest of this level, but
next level we'll start using

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.940
a much more flexible system
called an orthographic camera.
