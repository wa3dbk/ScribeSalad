00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
What this means is not for any given number of variables,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.030
we can write a Boolean formula

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.430
that can be satisfied

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.530
if and only if exactly what one of these variables is set to true,

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.110
and we figure out that we can do this for any number of variables that we want.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.640
So now let's go back to snapshots

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.230
and see what the Boolean formula

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.090
that I just showed you has to do with these snapshots.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.130
Each snapshot, as we've said, basically consists of

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.840
3 components, so we have the read only number here,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.119
which is basically the input.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.390
We have program, and we have the read-write memory

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.200
for immediate results and output.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.330
So now let's think back a moment of how we defined the RAM.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.740
When we defined the RAM in the last unit,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.370
what we said was the following.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.230
We said that whenever we're talking about memory,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.480
so this part here or this part here,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.450
then every single cell in the memory can not hold

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.920
arbitrarily large variables,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.720
which means, for example, that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.100
this cell here could either be 0;

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.040
it could be 1, it could be 2, and so on,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.490
but there's a certain limit of how large those values here can be,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.330
just as with your novel computer programs, too.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.630
They can carry very, very large numbers

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.090
but there's a limit

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.230
and that limit is some constant,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.310
so I'll just write c here, so if you have an 8-bit computer,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.270
that constant will be smaller, of course, than if you have a 16-bit computer

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.360
and so on, but in any case,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.010
it will be some constant determined by the machine,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.800
and the same thing is going to be true all along the memory.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.850
So for each single memory cell

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.600
that you have here,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.650
you have a constant number of possibilities

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.050
for the values that this memory cell can take,

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.250
so the size here is constant,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.170
and here, it's polynomial in n,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.850
as we figured out before.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.320
Now what about the program?

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.470
So for the program, we said that,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.150
of course the size of the program of the algorithm

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.110
does not change with the size of the input,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.250
so if you look at the program and your write it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.790
as we said, we've written the code from left to right,

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.810
but normally, you'll write it from top to bottom,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.270
so if you took this code and wrote it like this,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.490
then you would have a constant number of lines in your program

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.240
and that would be a certain position on where you are,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.290
so again here,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.810
there's a constant number of potential positions where you can be in the code,

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.800
and of course, you just have one code,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.350
so there's no polynomial size here.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.120
It's just a constant number of code lines.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.590
And finally, over here fr the input;

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.440
of course this is read only, but what I'm interested in

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.680
is again the possible number of states

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.720
that you can have in each of these memory cells,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.710
and that again is the same constant as over here,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.000
and here we have again a polynomial in n,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.890
so what does this have to do with the Boolean formula that I just showed you?

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.610
Well, what we could do is turn this into a Boolean formula

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.400
with a huge number of variables,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.760
but you will see that the number of variables is still polynomial.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.080
So what are my variables going to be?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.920
I'm going to have one variable

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.860
for each of those black boxes here

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.110
and also one variable for each of these here,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.850
and so on, and so on, and so on.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.230
I'm going to have

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.930
one variable for all of the possibilities

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.150
where I could be in my program code,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.920
and again here I'm going to do the same thing as I did here on the left side.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.950
I will have one Boolean variable

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.220
for each of those possibilities,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.180
and what one of those Boolean variables means is

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.750
basically--or what I want it to mean is

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.710
if it's set to true,

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.450
it tells me that

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.440
a memory cell contains that value,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.780
so if this variable here is set to true,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.480
I want that memory cell up here to contain the value 0.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.990
If it's set to 1, I want this one here to contain the value 1.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.140
If it's set to 2, I want this one here to have the value 2, and so on.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.120
And now you see why the Boolean formula that I just showed you

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.700
where you can force just exactly one single variable to be true

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.530
is useful in this case,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.640
because if I put all of these variables here

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.970
into such a Boolean formula,

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.620
I would have a Boolean formula that can be satisfied

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.329
if and only if

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.040
exactly one of those variables here is true,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.700
so it tells me

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.300
uniquely what goes into this memory cell here

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.400
as long as it's satisfied,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.400
and the same thing over here, and over here, and over here.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.310
And now

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.270
if I write this Boolean formula for this memory cell here,

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.090
I write it for this memory cell here, here of course also,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.290
and so on,

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.040
and if I combine all of those Boolean formulas,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.860
so I have a Boolean formula here,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.490
I have a Boolean formula here,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.980
I have one here,

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.270
from this column,

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.400
from this column,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.530
from this column, and so on.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.620
So I have Boolean formula,

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.240
and then I do an and,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.670
and I have the next Boolean formula, and I have an and,

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.960
and I have the next Boolean formula,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.820
and I continue doing this, and I will also do this here for the program.

00:05:12.820 --> 99:59:59.000
And of course, I will get a very, very, very large Boolean formula.
