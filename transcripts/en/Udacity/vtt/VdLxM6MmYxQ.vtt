00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.090
Games are a team effort.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.110
You, the developer,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.840
are often working with a designer who
decides how the game should work.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.710
It's then your job to bring
their designs to life.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.010
Even when you're working alone,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.120
it's a good idea to keep these
two jobs somewhat separate.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.950
Take your level design, for instance.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.798
You don't want to have to write Java and

00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:21.052
recompile your game every time you
move a platform or add a new enemy.

00:00:21.052 --> 00:00:25.096
Ideally you'd like to use some external
purpose built level-editing tool to

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:28.170
create a level file,
which can then be loaded by your game.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.060
And this level will do just that,
using the Tiled level editor to create

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.120
JSON level files, which will then turn
into an actual level object in our game.
