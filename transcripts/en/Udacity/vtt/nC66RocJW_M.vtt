Okay, now, the last bit. The useThisImage method

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.170
is called when the user has decided they want

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.216
to, well, use the current image. So we

00:00:10.216 --> 00:00:13.060
need to call the callback that they provided. But

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.710
we need to hand them back the image as a data URL. Let's presume that you want

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.370
the image/png media type. What code should you

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.730
fill in right here to get that data URL?
