00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:07.122
So how do you do? The correct answer is that the GCF is 9qp squared, and the

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:12.650
remaining factors are 3qp minus 2q plus 5p. Let's see how we got that answer.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:20.510
First I want to look at the numbers 27, 18, and 45. So I ask myself, what is the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.056
largest number that goes evenly into 27, 18, and 45? And with some practice

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:31.733
you'll notice that the largest number that goes into those three numbers is 9.

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:36.514
When we look at the variables, I need the variable to be in each of the 3 terms

00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:41.844
and I want to take the lowest exponent of each of the variables. So for the q's,

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:48.405
I have q squared, q squared, and q. So the lowest exponent is 1. For the p's I

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:55.088
have p cubed, p squared, and p cubed, so the lowest power of p is squared. So

00:00:55.088 --> 00:01:01.615
the GCF as we said was 9qp squared. What I'm trying to figure out what are the

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:07.222
remaining factors, I want to look at the first term, 27 q squared p cubed and I

00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:12.920
want to ask myself, what do I need to multiply the GCF by to get the first term.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.163
First you'll look at the coefficient. I need to multiply 9 by 3 to get 27. I

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:27.851
have to multiply q by q to get q squared. And I need to multiply p squared by p

00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:33.476
to get p cubed. So, that's the first term. For the next term, once again I ask

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:44.254
myself. What do I need to multiply the GCF by to get the second term? I need to

00:01:44.254 --> 00:01:49.740
multiply 9 by 2 to get 18. I need to multiply q by q to get q squared. And what

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.950
do I need to multiply p squared by to get p squared? Nothing, just 1. So our

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.410
second term is 2q or negative 2q. And then I put the next sign, which is plus.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.840
What do I need to multiply 9qp squared by to get the third term? Well, 9 times 5

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:18.179
is 45. Q times 1 is q. P squared times p gives me p cubed. When factoring, one

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:23.022
of the most important steps is to find and factor out the GCF. Let's get back to

00:02:23.022 --> 00:02:25.653
Chris so he can teach us more about factoring.
