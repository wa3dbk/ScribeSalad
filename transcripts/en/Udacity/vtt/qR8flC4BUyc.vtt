I recognize that a catalog of design principles is too abstract to be

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.620
immediately useful to you. I hope, however, that by being made aware of these

principles, you'll be sensitized to problematic situations when they arise.

You can then look up the relevant principle and

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.170
it's suggested solutions to help you resolve the issue that you you've seen.
