00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.390
David what did you think and

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.850
tell us also why you chose
the answers that you did.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.640
&gt;&gt; So I said that these five were
all birds, each of them have wings,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.480
each of them have feathers, and
I know that each of them lay eggs.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.005
The other three are kind of interesting.

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.435
This is a sugar glider, and
it flies, and we often think of

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:20.755
flying as a bird behavior, but it
doesn't fly the same way birds do, and

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:22.755
it doesn't have the other
features that birds have.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:26.202
It has fur instead of feathers and
doesn't actually have wings and

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:27.862
we also know it doesn't lay eggs.

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:29.012
A bat is even more interesting.

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:32.351
A bat does have wings, but it doesn't
have feathers the way birds do and

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:34.332
bats actually give birth to live young.

00:00:34.332 --> 00:00:37.022
The platypus shown here is
an interesting case because it actually

00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:39.242
lays eggs,
it has a bill like a bird does,

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:42.372
and it also has flippers
the way a duck does.

00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:44.382
But it's still not a bird because
it doesn't have feathers.

00:00:44.382 --> 00:00:47.810
So I would say that these
five are all our birds.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.190
Some of the things that we often
attribute to birds like flying,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.450
the blue bird, and
the eagle, and the duck do.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.070
Penguins and
ostriches don't actually do,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.510
but they're still birds because they
meet our other criteria for birds.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.270
&gt;&gt; That was a good answer,
David, thank you.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.510
Note that David was able to classify
these eight animals into birds, which

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.030
one of these animals belong to the class
of birds and which did not belong to it?

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.170
Notice also that he used some
criteria to decide on that.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.800
He has some notion it seems
of what is a typical bird,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.520
what kind of features
does a typical bird have.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.460
Here's some notion of what
are the basic conditions that something

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.260
must satisfy in order to
be considered a bird.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.270
And if those conditions are not being
satisfied, he would reject them and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.420
say those are not birds.
