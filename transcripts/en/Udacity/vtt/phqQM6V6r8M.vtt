00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Narrator] Now you understand a little about how to use a complex data structure like a list.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm going to talk some about how computers actually store data.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
To use a list you don't really need to understand this,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but it will certainly give you a better appreciation of what's going on inside the computer.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In order to store data you need 2 things:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you need something that preserves state and can be in more than 1 state,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
2 states is enough, and you need something that can read the state of that thing.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
One way to think about that is to think about a light switch.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Here we have a switch; we have our light bulb,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
presumably it's also connected to some power source,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and when we flip the switch that turns the light bulb on.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It changes its state.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The light bulb has 2 different states.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It can be off or on, so that means it can store 1 bit of data.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In the next lecture I'll talk more about what a bit means,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but something that can have 2 distinct states can store 1 bit,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and if we had enough light bulbs well we could store many, many bits,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
which would be enough to keep track of any amount of data that we wanted.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We don't need just something that can change state though.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We need something that can also sense the state.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
With a light button, well, that could be someone's eye.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You can see if the light bulb is on or off, and then you know its state.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You could have a light sensor that would do that if you wanted to make that automatic.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The way computers store data is sort of like this, except for it's using

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
much less energy and much less space

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
than a light bulb to store the state of data,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and it's not using a human eye.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It's using sensing electrons or sensing magnetism to sense the state of something.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That's 1 way to store data is like a switch,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and the fastest memory in your computer works that way.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The data that's stored directly in the processor, which is called the register,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
is stored like a switch that makes it very fast to change its state,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to record what the state is, but it's also like a light bulb.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It means that when we turn the power off we lose the state,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
so it's not persistent, and it's a lot more expensive than other ways of storing data.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The other way computers store data is more like a bucket.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We could represent having a 1 by having a bucket that's full.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We could represent having a 0 by having a bucket that's empty.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Then to check the state of the bucket, we could weigh the bucket

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or look at the bucket to figure out whether it's full or empty,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and the difference between buckets and light bulbs is--

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
--well, buckets leak a little bit.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Water is falling out of the bucket and they also evaporate.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
If we want to store data using a bucket it won't last forever.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Eventually the bucket will evaporate, and we can't tell the difference

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
between a 0 and a 1, and I should also point out

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that the amount of water in the bucket--well, we're going to have to decide

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
some threshold where if it's above that threshold

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
we think that it represents a 1.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
If it's below that threshold we think it represents a 0.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We could certainly imagine having many more levels than just 2 in the bucket.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
For computing it's almost always the case that we want to use a digital abstraction

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
where everything only represents 1 of 2 things.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
That makes it less likely that we get it wrong.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
As the water evaporates we know it's still a 1 until it gets really near the bottom,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but when it gets near the bottom there's going to be some left,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and we want to know when it becomes a 0.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
When we're doing this with electrons we don't call it a bucket.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
We call it a capacitor.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
The memory in your computer that works this way is called DRAM.
