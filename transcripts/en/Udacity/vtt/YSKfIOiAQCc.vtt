00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.540
To wrap up this lesson,

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.160
we want to make sure we drive
home these two main points.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.700
It is incredibly important that
you're always doing experiments and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.200
iterating on your marketing decisions.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.030
Don't make assumptions,
base your decisions on your research.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.427
And don't waste time on planning
the best strategy on the first go,

00:00:18.427 --> 00:00:19.386
just get started.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.990
You can iterate on your plan as you go.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.260
It's more important to measure and

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.610
improve your performance than it is to
get the absolute perfect plan down.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.640
&gt;&gt; Also, find the right balance
between your qualitative insights and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.470
your quantitative data that you
receive through your experiments and

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.992
user testing.

00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:38.390
You want to learn what's happening with
your marketing message through your data

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.450
and why it's happening
through your user testing.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.280
This way you're going to be able to make
more informed decisions in the future.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.693
&gt;&gt; And hopefully, you are in
the mindset of building, measuring and

00:00:48.693 --> 00:00:51.441
learning from marketing
experiments on an online basis.

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:54.985
&gt;&gt; Now we really want to congratulate
you on completing this course and

00:00:54.985 --> 00:00:57.844
we wish you the best of luck
in your future endeavors.

00:00:57.844 --> 00:00:58.980
Come back and share [INAUDIBLE]
with us when you have them, bye.
