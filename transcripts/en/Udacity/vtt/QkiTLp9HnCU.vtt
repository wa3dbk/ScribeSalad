00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.450
Let's actually look at the whole
concept of aligning images, right.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.260
First thing I can do is if I have
a pair of images left and right,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.200
I can just translate the image on top
of each other, find similar features.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.730
Just showcased here as long
as I can do a decent job of

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.900
aligning some of these things,
I might be fine but will I really be?

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.540
I mean, again, the options that I may
have in this kind of relationship is

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.790
I may be able to put
a left image on top and

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.780
the right image on the bottom and
do a best possible alignment that way.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.350
Another option is I can put r, the right
image on top and the left on bottom and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.850
you can see that now we can actually
start figuring out a little bit more

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.480
between these two images but in reality,
we need to be able to do a lot more.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.000
In reality, what we need to do is be
able to kind of blend these images

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.290
together but before we do that,
we also have to warp the left and

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.580
right images and again,
this warp means now,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.090
if you'll notice, is that the image
is no longer rectangular.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.370
And, of course, what that basically
means is now we've been able to kind of

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.580
merge the regions that
similar across both images.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.930
So warping, in this instance,
is a better solution and

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.960
again, now we know how
to do that kind of stuff
