00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.940
General entrepreneur advice?

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.195
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; My favorite question so far.

00:00:05.195 --> 00:00:09.280
[LAUGH] Just be passionate.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.080
Understand what it is you want and
why you're doing this thing.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.710
Because if you don't, if you're chasing
something or following someone else's

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.650
advice, you are living what they want,
not what you want.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.980
The best way to succeed that
I found is to follow that

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.150
thing that is important to you and
knowing what's important to you is

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.800
actually a big challenge,
a lot of people don't know.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.522
There's a few other
things I can add to this.

00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:42.420
One is, my dream was always
to come to California and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.400
work for one of the largest,
most influential companies in the area.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.610
I've had this dream since I read
Microserf's when I was 12 and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.780
it took 20 odd years before that
actually happened but it did happen.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.660
But through the process of just
always focusing on that's my goal and

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.640
everything that I'm going to do
is somehow going to get me there.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.680
All the businesses that I started,
all the business partners and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.730
relationships I built and communities
that I was involved in through all

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.269
the businesses that I ran, I was always
looking to come specifically here.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.520
On the flip side of that,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.320
something I would advise all
entrepreneurs to be aware of especially

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.990
in the startup scene, is that
startups are seen as a product now.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.340
They are a commodity in and
out of themselves.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.010
There is an entire
industry that is built up

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.180
around selling things to startups and
selling the concept of startups.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.380
Don't believe the hype.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.720
Do not waste your time going
to stupid conferences for

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.520
silly awards that mean
nothing to your business.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.960
Always focus on your core values and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.400
what your business means to you and
why it's valuable.
