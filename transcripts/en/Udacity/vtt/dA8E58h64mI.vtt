00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.614
We know this is the answer. This rational expression is the odd one out, since

00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:09.496
it equals positive 1. This expression over here is really equal to negative 1,

00:00:09.496 --> 00:00:14.040
since x minus 7 divided by the quantity x minus 7 simplifies to 1. We get a

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.112
negative 1 since we have a negative sign sitting out here. This is really

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:22.350
negative 1 times 1. For this first rational expression, we can switch the order

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.425
of the denominator. I can have the negative x come first, and then followed by

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:31.305
the positive 7. We can see that this expression is the same as this last

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:36.021
expression down here. But this doesn't quite look like negative 1. But these two

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:40.168
rational expressions don't look like negative 1, but in fact, they are. We know

00:00:40.168 --> 00:00:45.552
these expressions in the numerator and denominator are opposite polynomials. The

00:00:45.552 --> 00:00:49.930
x terms are opposite in sign, as are the constant terms. We can factor a

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.960
negative 1 from our denominator to get negative 1 times x minus 7. Then we can

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.976
simplify our common factors in the numerator and denominator, leaving us with

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:03.103
negative 1. Nice thinking if you found that one.
