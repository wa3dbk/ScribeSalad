00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.240
Congratulations, you've made it through
the first hurdle in iOS development.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.520
You have UI elements, and

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.500
you've wired them up to call
your code with IB actions.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.110
And you've reach back to
the UI using IB outlets.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.000
In the second part of this lesson,
you're going to learn how to set up

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.799
multiple views, so that you can go
between two different view controllers.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.820
No more single view applications for
you.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.790
Most iOS applications you will
be developing will venture

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.820
further than a single screen.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.980
In order to use multiple
view controllers,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.590
you will need another class,
that let's you navigate between them.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.540
There are two common classes to use for

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.090
handling multiple view
controllers in iOS.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.710
UI navigation controller and,
UI tab are controller.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.250
Both of these are covered in depth
when you get to UI kit fundamentals

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.920
in the next module.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.640
For now let's just discuss the basics of
a UINavigation Navigation controller.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.260
The UINavigation Controller is
a class that handles a stack

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.050
of multiple view controllers.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.300
Like any other stack in computer science
or real life, you can insert and

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.460
remove items from the stack.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.900
In the UINavigation Controller you start
out with a single view controller,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.540
called the rootViewController.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.020
You can add as many of your controllers
on top of it as you'd like.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.300
In pitch perfect we're going to
have just two view controllers.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.950
One for recording, and one for playback.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.890
So our use UINavigationController,
will be just for those two screens.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.250
Before we can run, we need to walk.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.480
Currently our app have the view
controller named ViewController

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.910
as a start of the app.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.880
With the main story
board opened selected.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.030
Notice the little gray arrow
here that indicates that

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.960
this is the initial view controller.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.160
If you have multiple view controllers,
you can drag this arrow to change

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.810
which view controller to storyboard, and
therefore your app, will start with.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.340
This arrow is also
driven by the checkbox

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.820
titled is initial view controller
here in the attribute inspector.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.770
If you uncheck this arrow,
the storyboard won't know

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.870
what view controller to start the app
with and you'll get a runtime crash.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.900
Make sure the is initial
view controller is checked.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.400
With the view controller selected,
the orange circle here in the document

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.800
outline, go into the editor menu and
select embed in navigation controller.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.980
You can see that x code has
created a UInavigation controller

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.520
to start the app, and that our view
controller is the root view controller

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.340
of that navigation controller.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.980
Now you're ready to add more view
controllers to pitch perfect.
