00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.848
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For the first one, we plug in 3, in for x. So I have negative 2 times 3 plus

00:00:05.848 --> 00:00:11.853
7. So I get negative 6 plus 7, which is 1. For the next one, I plug in 0 for x.

00:00:11.853 --> 00:00:17.252
And I wind up with 7. For f of negative 2, I plug in negative 2 for my x

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:23.460
variable. That's my input. Negative 2 times negative 2 is positive 4 and these

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.058
numbers sum to 11. For this last input, I have 4x squared, so I know my answer

00:00:29.058 --> 00:00:34.997
is going to contain a variable. I substitute 4x squared as my input and negative

00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:40.516
2 times 4 is negative 8. So I have negative 8x squared for my first term. And

00:00:40.516 --> 00:00:45.737
then positive 7 added to the end. Great job if you got all of those right.
