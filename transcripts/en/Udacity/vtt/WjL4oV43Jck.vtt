00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:08.266
So now that we now that the slope of two to the power of X at X equals zero is slightly less than one,

00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:14.266
and the slope of three to the power of X at X equals zero is slightly larger than one,

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:20.866
so it's not hard to imagine that somewhere in between two and three, there is a number called E--

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:28.232
Euler's number--so that E to the power of X has a slope of exactly one at X equals zero.

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:40.166
This function is called The Exponential Function. Whereas two to the power of X and three to the power of X are just exponential functions.

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:46.432
As this exponential function, The Exponential Function is so important, it gets a special name;

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:53.299
It's not just E to the power of X. It's called exp of X. This is the natural exponential function.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.066
And we already know that its basis, E, is a number between two and three.

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:02.299
Now we can start from this idea and compute Euler's number.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:11.799
E is nothing but E to the first power. Great. Let me write this one as 10,000 divided by 10,000.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.599
Up to now, this looks completely crazy. Where am I going? I'm going to apply the laws for powers.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:28.332
This is E to the one over 10,000 to the power of 10,000. Remember that rule--if you take a power of a power,

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:35.166
you multiply the exponents. This is what you get. But E to the power of one over 10,000,

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:40.299
that's something pretty close to X equals zero on this blue curve.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:48.166
So rather than looking up the value on that blue curve, I'm using the red line, the tangent line, to compute that value,

00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:57.232
to approximate that value, that is. The slope is one, so we can just put X in here, plus the Y intercept is one as well.

00:01:57.233 --> 00:02:02.666
And now I'm using this equation for the tangent line to approximate this value.

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:13.699
The value of E to the X at X equals one over 10,000. So this is approximately equal to one over 10,000 plus one.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.466
We simply looked up that value using the tangent line. Let me plug that in. Then we have E is approximately equal to--

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:29.832
I changed the order here to make it look nicer--one plus one over 10,000, to the power of 10,000.

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:35.432
Guess what? We have an equation, well, an approximate equation, for Euler's number.

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:45.766
The official definition for Euler's number is the following: E equals the limit of N goes to infinity of one plus one over N

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:50.566
to the power of N. I hope that you can now easily guess where this comes from.

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:58.066
The larger this number gets, the better these approximations get. And the result is 2.7 something.

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:06.132
Footnote: This equation is pretty elegant when it comes to deriving E, but when it comes to computing the actual value of E,

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:07.933
this equation is pretty inefficient.
