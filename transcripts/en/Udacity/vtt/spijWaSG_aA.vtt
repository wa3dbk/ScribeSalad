00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now we know how to call functions and return from functions,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and this makes me doubly happy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But both of those things assume we have a function somewhere,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which we currently don't.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We don't know how to make them.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So right now, very soon, we're going to get into defining functions,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
making new functions out of nothing.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here I've defined the same function in Python on the left and JavaScript on the right.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And while the syntax changes, we spell the words differently,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
all the key concepts are there.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We have to list the name of the function, fname,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we have to list the formal parameters, fparam in our previous example,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and we have to give the body.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And we said we'd just make a tuple, a for tuple that has the word "function" as a string.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So if the user writes in code like this and we're making our JavaScript interpreter

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
for our web browser, what should we turn it into?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Well, a function value that has 4 parts:

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the word "function," telling us that it's something we can call;

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the list of parameters, x, maybe y and z;

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the body, a list of statements;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the environment we were in when the function was defined.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We don't need the function name because we'll be adding a mapping

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
from the name to this value in the environment--

00:01:15.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to the old environment, that is, not this new one. To the previous one.
