00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.467
Our two lines intersect at this point. We follow that up to the x-axis, looks to

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:10.703
be halfway between these two grid lines, which are x equals negative 4 and x

00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:15.446
equals negative 6, which means, the x-coordinate is negative 5. The

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:21.012
y-coordinate, if we go over the y-axis, is negative 11. So, this point is

00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:26.202
negative 5, negative 11. And the x-coordinate of that is negative 5. So, x

00:00:26.214 --> 00:00:31.687
equals negative 5. Remember that the original equation we started with was 3x

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.790
plus 4 equals 2x minus 1. Let's make sure that negative 5 actually is a solution

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:41.277
for this equation. If we plug in negative 5 to the left-hand side, we get 3

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.054
times negative 5 plus 4. And this simplifies to negative 11, which was, in fact,

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:50.763
the y-coordinate that we found for our point. On the right-hand side, we have 2

00:00:50.775 --> 00:00:57.755
times negative 5 minus 1, and that also equals negative 11. So, the solution for

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:00.633
x works for our original equation. Awesome.
