00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.497
This first answer doesn't really help. Size doesn't matter, it's transparency

00:00:04.497 --> 00:00:09.160
that's causing the problem. The second answer works. The blue object is further

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.798
from the eye than the red one, so will be drawn first. However, for more

00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:17.340
complicated scenes, it's a bit of overkill and inefficient to boot. The sorting

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.240
order of a set of opaque objects doesn't affect the final result on the screen,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.166
that's the z buffer's job to sort out. Drawing a pick objects in a back to front

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:30.258
order is not efficient, as fragments will be processed by the fragment shader,

00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:33.574
then covered up by the next closest object. The third answer is not

00:00:33.574 --> 00:00:37.694
particularity meaningful, and won't solve anything. The blue object essentially

00:00:37.694 --> 00:00:42.064
already has an alpha, it's equal to one meaning fully opaque. Even with blending

00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:46.518
on, an opaque object will still act like an opaque object. This solution does

00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:50.204
not fix the problem that the blue object does not being rendered early enough.

00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:54.100
The fourth answer works for this case, where there is only one transparent

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.608
object. First all the opaque objects are drawn, there's only one, it is then

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:03.280
guaranteed that the transparent object will be able to blend with the opaque

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.462
objects as needed.
