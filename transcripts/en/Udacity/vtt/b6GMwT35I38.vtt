00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:00.940
Thanks, Sarah.

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, I'm going to use git branches to create an experimental change in

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.250
the Asteroids repository.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.390
This game is pretty hard, and I don't want to change that.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.680
But I'd also like to create an easier version of the game.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.510
If I do, there will be two versions of the game that are almost

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.450
exactly the same, but with some slight differences.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.310
So this is a great time to create a branch.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.310
Now, there's a lot of ways I could make this game easier.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.740
But here's one.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.280
Every time I shoot an asteroid, it breaks into three smaller fragments.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.140
I'll try making it easier to complete the level by only making it

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.070
break into two each time.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.010
I don't want to make this change on the master branch though,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.260
since I don't consider it an official update to the game.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.860
Instead, I'll create a branch called easy mode for that change.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.050
I can use the command git branch to create and view branches.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.260
First, I'll run git branch with no arguments,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.130
which shows me my current branches.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.450
Right now, the only branch is master, which is the default branch.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.790
Now, I'll run git branch easy-mode.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.030
When I give an argument to git branch, it creates a new branch with that name.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.390
So now, when I run git branch again,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.495
I can see that the easy-mode branch was created.

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:11.540
This star next to master means that master is the branch that

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.340
is currently checked out.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.170
So that's the one that will update if I make a change.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.510
That's not what I want.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.410
I want the easy-mode label to update when I make a change.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.360
And master to stay the same.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.670
So I'll run the command git checkout easy-mode.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.410
And now, when I run git branch again,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.670
I can see that easy-mode is the checked out branch.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.150
Since I just created the easy-mode branch,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.160
it has the same code as master right now, but I'm about to change that.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.630
To make the easy-mode, I'll open the file game.js.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.380
I saw earlier that the code I'm interested in changing has a common break in

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.610
to fragments.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.920
So I'll search for fragments.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.710
Here I find a loop that executes 3 times,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.630
which is making 3 smaller asteroids, which the author calls roids.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.340
So I'll change this 3 to a 2.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.290
And give the game a try.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.020
Sure enough, now only two smaller asteroids form.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.750
Now, I'd like to commit this change.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.020
Even though it's only a one-character change,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.930
I consider this one logical change since it changes the behavior of the game and

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.580
it completely accomplishes the goal I had.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.110
I'll add my change to the staging area.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.510
And then commit it.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.620
And I'll use the commit message make asteroids split into two

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.320
smaller pieces rather than three.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.070
Now, go ahead and create and easy-mode branch on your computer.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.290
Then checkout that branch.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.780
And commit a change making the game easier.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.360
You can use the same commit that I did.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.830
You can find the line that I changed at line 678.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.420
Or you can search for break into fragments, like I did.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.700
When you're finished, paste the output of git status into this box.
