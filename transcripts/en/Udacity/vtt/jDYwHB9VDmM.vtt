00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.108
Okay, so Michael, in the spirit of what we just went through in

00:00:04.108 --> 00:00:08.660
deriving the geometric series, I'm now going to write down a bunch of

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.230
math. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to say it

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.150
at you, and you're going to interrupt me if it doesn't make sense. Okay?

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.912
&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:19.320
&gt;&gt; It does. Okay, so here's the first thing I'm going to

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.520
write down. I've decided that by going through this excercise of Of utilities

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.900
in this kind of reward, we can now write down what the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.670
optimal policy is. The optimal policy, which as you recall is simply pi

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.200
star, is simply the one that maximizes our long-term expected reward. Which

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.810
looks like what? Well, it looks like this. There, does that make sense?

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.110
&gt;&gt; Let me think, so. We have an expected value of the sum, of the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.600
discounted rewards, at time t. And, given, pi. Meaning that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.770
we're going to be following pi?

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.100
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. So these are the, the sequence of states

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.330
we're going to see in a world where we follow pi.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.960
And it's an expectation because, things are non-deterministic. Or may

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.290
be non-deterministic. And do we know which state we started?

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.030
&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter, it's whatever s zero is.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.600
&gt;&gt; I see. Whatever s zero is, but isn't that random? I

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.810
mean s one and s two, s three; those are all random.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.730
&gt;&gt; Well, we start at some state, it doesn't matter, so t is starting

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.180
out a zero. And going to infinity. Okay? So does this make sense?

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.470
&gt;&gt; Yes, so then, so we're saying, I would

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.590
like to know the policy that maximizes the value of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.000
that expression. So it gives us the highest expected

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.110
reward. Yeah, that's the kind of policy I would want.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.680
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So, good, we're done, we know what the

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.020
optimum policy is. Except that it's not really clear what

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.660
to do with this. All we've really done is written

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.870
down what we knew it was we were trying to solve.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.730
But it turns out that we've defined utility in

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.470
such a way that it's going to help us to solve

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.700
this. So let me write that down as well.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.630
I'm going to say that the utility of a particular seque,

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.230
of a particular state okay. Well it's going to depend

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.960
upon the policy that were following. So I'm going to rewrite

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.150
the utility that takes the superscript pie. And thats

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.920
simply going to be the expected set of states that

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.180
I'm going to see from that point on given

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.660
that I've followed the policy. There, does that make sense?

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.210
&gt;&gt; It feels like the same thing. I

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.110
guess the difference now is that you're saying the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.940
utility of the policy out of state is

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.990
what happens if we start running from that state.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.420
&gt;&gt; Yep. And we follow that policy.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.910
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.820
&gt;&gt; Right. So, this answers the question you

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.600
asked me before about, well, what's S0? Well, we

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.970
talk about that in terms of the utility of the state. So how good is it to be

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.600
in some state? Well, it's exactly as good to

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.970
be in that state as what we will expect to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.130
see from that point on. Given that we're a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.820
following a specific policy where we started in that state.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.290
&gt;&gt; Hm,.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.070
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.870
&gt;&gt; Kay. Yeah.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.420
&gt;&gt; Very important point here, Michael, is that the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.960
reward for entering a state is not the same thing

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.950
as the utility for that state. Right? And in particular.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.490
What reward gives us is immediate gratification or immediate feedback.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.490
Okay? But utility gives us long term feedback. Does that make sense? So

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.180
when reward [UNKNOWN] is the actual value that we get for being in that

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.250
state. Utility [UNKNOWN] state is both the reward we get for that state.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.870
But also, all the reward that we're going to get from that point on.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.860
&gt;&gt; I see. So yeah. That seems like a really important difference.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.630
Like, if I say, here's a dollar. You know? Would you poke

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.220
the president of your university in the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.780
eye? You'd be, like, okay. The immediate reward

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.090
for that is one. But the long term utility of that could be actually quite low.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.540
&gt;&gt; Right. On the other hand, I say, well, why don't you go to college?

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.740
And you say, but that's going to cost me $40.000. Or better yet, why don't you

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.810
get a masters degree in computer science

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.480
from Georgia tech, bu you can say that's

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.840
going to cost me $6600. Yes, but at the end of it you will have a degree.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.680
And by the way it turns out the average starting salary for

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.067
people who are getting a masters degree or undergraduate degree is about $45000.

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:57.700
&gt;&gt; So is it considered product placement if

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.010
you. Plug your own product within the product itself?

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.640
&gt;&gt; No, I'm just simply stating fact

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.390
Michael. This is all I'm doing. Just facts.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.680
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.510
&gt;&gt; This is called fact placement.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.660
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.820
&gt;&gt; The point is, there's a, an immediate negative

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.090
reward, of say, $6,600 for, I'm going through a degree.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.760
Or maybe it's $10,000 by the time, the 15th person

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.230
sees this. But anyway, it's some cost. But, presumably it's

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.150
okay to go to college, or go to grad school,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.400
or whatever. Because at the end of it you are going

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.020
to get something positive out of it. So it is

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.890
not just that it prevents you from taking short term positive

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.920
things if that is going to lead to long term

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.100
negative things. I also always you to take short term negatives

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.530
if it will lead to long term positives. That makes

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.630
sense. What this does is this gets us back to

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.350
what I mentioned earlier. Which is this notion of delayed

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.570
reward. So we have this notion of reward, but utilities are

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.490
really about accounting for all delayed rewards. And if you

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.750
think about that, I think you can begin to see

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.920
how, given you have a mathematical expression delayed rewards, you

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.400
will be able to start dealing with the credit assignment problem.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.785
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:05:01.785 --> 00:05:04.090
&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's keep going and write more equations.
