00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.166
So now we have an idea about the half-life being larger than the lifetime, but we can also actually compute the half-life

00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:17.066
from the lifetime. This is what we've seen before, the differential equation for the exponential decay, 20 seconds being the lifetime.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:30.666
This is its solution. Here's one more ingredient: A is equal to E to the power of B if, and only if, the natural logarithm of A

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:37.799
equals B. Use this to determine the half-life in this situation.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:46.066
So what's the half-life? Is it 20 seconds divided by the natural logarithm of two, minus 20 seconds times the natural logarithm

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:54.232
of one half? 20 seconds times the natural logarithm of two? Or minus 20 seconds times the natural logarithm of two?

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.467
Check all that apply.
