00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.490
Another yet more subtle technique that you can employ as

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.220
a visual designer is the use of negative space.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.450
Negative space is developed around and between the shapes or forms of objects.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.460
Take, for instance, this classic example of Rubin's vase.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.000
Are we actually looking at a vase here or

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
are we looking at two people face each other?

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.628
You might be more familiar with examples of negative space in company logos.

00:00:26.628 --> 00:00:31.630
For example, FedEx hides an arrow between the capital E and the letter x.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.740
This design reinforces the company's function as shipping service.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.080
Other logos include the television network NBC with its peacock shown here.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.575
And the white panda from the World Wildlife Fund.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.680
What designs or logos have you seen that use negative space?

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.680
I'd like you to share an example in the discussion thread titled

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.630
negative spaces.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.120
