00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.969
Take a moment to decide any reasons you can think of that would be

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.160
compelling for doing such a thing.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.890
Let me show you one example of why it might be a good reason to do this.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.210
Basically, it's rarely the case that any piece of logic is so simple as what we

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.190
see here, and you probably don't want to retype it over and over.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.220
So what if our code instead said this?

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.340
Obviously, I would not want to type all of this code everytime I

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.900
intended to move a car around.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.850
And, by abstracting it out into a function, it makes it much simpler for

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.680
me to just issue the intent that I have and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.330
have that result in all of the changes that are appropriate.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.300
But an even more important reason is to improve your experience of

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.660
refactoring your code down the line.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.800
If you decide you want to change how cars in the program are supposed to move,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.050
then there is only one part of this code that you will need to edit.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.950
It will just happen correctly in both of the places where you

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.420
called that function.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.410
Imagine you wanted to alter the way in which your cars move around the program,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.080
and you added an equation like this, which happens to be nonsense, but

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.610
let's say, you had something meaningful you wanted to put in there.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.520
If all the movement logic was in one place like this,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.430
you can be confident after you've edited this function that you've made

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.620
all the changes you need in order for your program to start working correctly.
