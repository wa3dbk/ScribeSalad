00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.580
Okay, so in the context of of
guidelines and planning, and

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.520
maybe overp lanning in a business,
there's a real danger for startups.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.091
I think, or at least it's been my
experience that people who are not maybe

00:00:14.091 --> 00:00:18.000
directly involved in the process
of creating the thing that's

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.787
at the core of the business.

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:22.585
Maybe in like a software company,
it's the engineers.

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:26.460
Or a marketing company,
it's the ads, or what have you.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.567
The people who are making the decisions,
if they're too disconnected from

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:36.831
the actual acts of the company, there is
a real problem where they could create

00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:42.054
plans that are just disconnected from
the actual realities of the business.

00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:45.902
I mean, I can't provide off the top of
my head any direct examples because I'm

00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:47.963
just forgetting all of them right now.

00:00:47.963 --> 00:00:51.350
But I've seen companies fail
all the time for misdirection.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.520
Bad planning, not understanding
what business you're actually in.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.220
So, especially in startups where you
are effectively building a business

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.980
that has no roadmap, you cannot
build a roadmap in advance of that.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.387
You can only reflect on the things
that others have done before.

00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:12.370
And usually you're
going to get that wrong.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.799
The whole purpose of
a startup is to carve a new

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.770
path in an area where
there are no paths.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.999
And trying to calculate in advance
too far where you're trying to go or

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.588
what you're trying to do or how you're
going to get there can actually lead you

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:32.330
way off base from where
you're trying to go.
