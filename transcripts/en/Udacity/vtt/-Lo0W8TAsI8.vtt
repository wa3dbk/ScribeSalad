00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.880
We'll begin with patient
access to their own data, and

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.680
we'll see how the bar gets raised as
the stages of meaningful use progress.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.240
We've discussed the requirements
in the first two stages.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.409
In Stage 3, as proposed,
80% of patients must be able

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:24.578
to access their records either
through the VDT function,

00:00:24.578 --> 00:00:31.238
or through an ONC certified API, or
application programming interface.

00:00:31.238 --> 00:00:38.040
And 35% must have access to
patient-specific educational materials.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.933
We mentioned the term API in our
team project discussion near

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.190
the end of lesson one,
when we discussed FHIR.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.140
For all practical purposes,
these two terms are probably going to be

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.380
synonymous in healthcare, that is FHIR
will be the API used in healthcare.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.170
Unsurprisingly, Stage 3 also raises
the bar on actual patient engagement.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.690
25% of patients must
access their records,

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.314
either through VDT or
through an ONC-certified API.

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:17.780
35% of patients must receive
a clinically relevant secure message.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.880
And of great interest with respect
to patient phasing technologies

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.320
such as those we'll
discuss in lesson seven,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.580
providers must incorporate
patient-generated data from non-clinical

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.550
settings such as home health for
15% of their patients.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.460
This requirement clearly anticipates the
increased use of mobile technologies and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.410
sensors in the home.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.134
Stage 3's proposed provider
requirements also increase

00:01:48.134 --> 00:01:52.103
the percentage of
e-prescriptions to 85% for

00:01:52.103 --> 00:01:57.430
eligible providers and
25% for eligible hospitals.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.240
They also require the use of 5 clinical

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.690
decision support tools tied
to 4 quality measures.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.283
And providers must use drug to drug and

00:02:07.283 --> 00:02:13.230
drug to allergy interaction alerts
during the entire reporting period.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.212
Hospitals must receive at least
80% of medication orders,

00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:23.100
60% of laboratory orders and
60% of diagnostic imaging

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.860
orders via computer-based
physician order entry.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.093
Although order entry by scribes,
assistants to physicians who enter

00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:36.550
the information for them,
does count toward these goals.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.660
Finally, Stage 3 has specific
interoperability requirements.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.235
Providers must send
an electronic summary for

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:49.440
50% of transitions of care and
referrals.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.940
You recall that these are major
sources of error in patient care.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.940
They must receive an electronic summary
for 40% of transitions and referral.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.170
And providers must perform medication
allergy problem list reconciliation for

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.700
80% of transitions of care and
referrals.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.150
Finally, eligible providers
must electronically submit

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.030
three out of five of the following
reporting requirements.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.030
Immunizations, syndromic surveillance,
this would be for infectious diseases.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.740
Reportable conditions case reporting,

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.950
certain conditions that need to
be reported to public health.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.570
Public health registries to keep
track of certain diseases and

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.800
conditions and non public health
registries, such as those for cancer.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.230
Eligible hospitals must submit
four from the same list

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.770
to which electronic lab
reporting is added.
