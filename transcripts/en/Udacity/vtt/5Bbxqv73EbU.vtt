00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
There's actually two correct answers here depending on how you think about it.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:15.970
Both answers in common that it's always 2n+1a, and depending on how you count this line here,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.430
it's going to be either a 0 or a 1 and the reason for that is the following--

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.200
the first line again takes 0*6 as in all previous examples.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:38.110
For the second line, it either takes n time steps if you assume that this for loop here goes

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.110
exactly through each character of the string and then stops immediately or it takes n+1 loops

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.810
if you assume that it's executed like a for loop or while loop.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.200
This again shows that it can be very annoying to do exact time counting.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.980
The next step though is always execute n times because the number of times this inter loop here

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.530
is executed does not depend on the number of time steps it takes for this line here to end.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.390
And finally, the counter is always increased when the algorithm encounters an a,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.520
so this line here is executed exactly 8 times.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.340
And if you sum up all of these, you get 2n+1*a, and depending on how you count this line,

00:01:22.340 --> 99:59:59.999
you either get a 0 or 1.
