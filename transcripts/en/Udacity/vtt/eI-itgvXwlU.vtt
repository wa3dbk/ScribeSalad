00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.180
The key to finishing this equation is that it takes Javier one hour longer than

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.630
Lucy. So let's let Lucy's time equal t. We'll use that for our first fraction.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.459
This fraction would represent one job completed in t hours. This means that

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:21.657
Javier can do the same job in t plus 1 hours. So his fraction would be one job

00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:28.449
divided by t plus 1 hours. His time is simply 1 hour more than Lucy's. So t

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.103
plus 1.
