00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.744
So Stanley Milgram did debrief his participants. That is, he told them exactly

00:00:03.744 --> 00:00:06.327
what the study was about and he made it very clear to them that they never hurt

00:00:06.327 --> 00:00:12.338
anybody. But that's not to say that the study was without controversy. In fact,

00:00:12.338 --> 00:00:15.794
remember that the participants really experienced serious and real mental

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:20.890
anguish and distress. When they thought they were hurting people. Now in fact,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.418
only 5% of the people though, said that they regretted participating in the

00:00:24.418 --> 00:00:30.396
study. But the controversy, was started. After Milgram /g, there was a real

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:34.885
serious debate, in and outside of psychology, about what was ethically okay, in

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:41.057
human research. So let's look more carefully at the ethics of Stanley Milgram's

00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:45.594
study. So what is it that he first did, well, he first recruited participants

00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:50.670
by telling them that this was a study on learning and punishment. And we now

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.957
know that was a lie, it was deceptive. But is that okay, is it okay in this

00:00:54.957 --> 00:00:59.720
case? To use that kind of deception in research. What do you think?
