The Blinn-Phone reflection model looks pretty good. It's been used for well

00:00:03.453 --> 00:00:07.096
over 30 years, because it's fairly flexible and quick to compute. On fixed

00:00:07.096 --> 00:00:10.120
function graphics hardware, where you could not program the shaders, this

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.580
reflection model was the one locked into transistors and could not be changed.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.226
Back then you could simulate other reflection models by verious tricks and

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:19.872
setting a large number of switches on the chip, but for the most part you were

00:00:19.872 --> 00:00:23.100
stuck with what was burnt into the transistors.
