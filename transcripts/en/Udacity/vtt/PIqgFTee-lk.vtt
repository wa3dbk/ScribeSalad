00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.200
Now there are just a few more nuances to the library and

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.360
steps we need to take before we can go from the source code of our

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.710
D3 visualization to a pretty graphic in the library.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.320
We have seen the source of a complete D3 visualization,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.970
in this case a horizontal bar chart, and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.740
we have played around with D3 in a web browser console.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.950
But how exactly do we go from a source file to what's displayed in

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.050
the web browser?

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.510
Every URL has four basic components.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.590
Sometimes, if you're using a modern browser, Chrome included, they hide

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.110
the first part of http:// since it's often common across all URLs.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.500
HTTP in this case, corresponds to the protocol that was used to load the page.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.480
If you simply double-click on HTML file, with out going to a web server,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.960
you may see file:// meaning that it was loaded with the file protocol.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.750
The second portion of the URL, in this case,

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.510
localhost, corresponds to the host or server from which the file was loaded.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.760
Since we're running a local web server to serve both our HTML and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.470
our data, it's simply localhost, meaning the current machine.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.920
The next section of the URL, which come after the colon, in this case 8000,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.540
refers to the port.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.520
If we think of our host, or

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.030
our server, as an apartment complex then the port would be

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.810
which individual unit of that apartment complex we would like to access.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.910
So again the host might be the address of the apartment building and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.390
the port might be the number of the apartment unit.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.220
And finally what comes after the port in this

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.720
case let's_make_a_bar_chart.html is the file you'd like to load.
