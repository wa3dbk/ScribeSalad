00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
My answer is 50 friends.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The way I get there is I don't know what type you are

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with a 50% chance or 1/2 you're type A, in which case you have 80 friends,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and a 50% chance you're type B and have 20 friends.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That gives me this equation over here as the expected number of friends.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Working this out means you have 40 + 10 = 50 friends.

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So far, so good, but why are you unpopular?
