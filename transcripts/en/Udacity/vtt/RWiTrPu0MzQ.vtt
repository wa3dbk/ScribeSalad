This is a fascinating, yet heartbreaking case, but it's a great way to start

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.440
this lesson because it shows us just how important our memory is to us as well

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.507
as our families. Now imagine being one of H. M.'s family members and watching

00:00:12.507 --> 00:00:16.329
him struggle with these profound memory problems. Or being one of the people

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.611
that he can't remember. That would be really difficult to deal with. Now even

00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:25.694
though H.M. had profound amnesia, he was well aware of his memory problems. He

00:00:25.694 --> 00:00:29.390
described it as constantly waking up from a dream he couldn't remember. Henry

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.590
Molaison contributed a great deal to the study of memory, as well as the areas

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.015
of the brain that are associated with forming and retrieving memories. After

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:41.330
his death, his brain was donated to a group of researchers at the University of

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.316
California San Diego. Who provided imaging of his brain tissue to map the

00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:49.305
brain. If you're interested on learning more, we provided a link to their

00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:53.449
website. It's really fascinating, you should check it out. Now HM showed us

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.244
just how important our memory is for us to function as successful human beings

00:00:56.244 --> 00:01:01.202
in our everyday environment. Psychologists look at a lot of different types of

00:01:01.202 --> 00:01:04.410
memory, but let's get started with just some of the basics for now.
