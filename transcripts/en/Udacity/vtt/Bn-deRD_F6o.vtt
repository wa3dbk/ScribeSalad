00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.570
Now remember earlier when we
were talking about stock value,

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.620
or I should say company value.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.170
And we looked at a way to compute
company value based on dividends.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.970
So companies pay regularly,
many companies,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.490
not all, dividends to their owners.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.210
And this can be worth a lot of money.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.893
So a stock that's priced
at say around $100,

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:32.706
can very often pay up to $1 or
$2 per year in dividends, or 1 or 2%.

00:00:32.706 --> 00:00:35.460
Some stocks pay even more than that.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.100
Now dividends can have
a significant affect

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.250
on what happens to the actual price
of the stock, and here's why.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.350
Suppose this stock is
trading at about $100.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.569
And they announce,
on this date in the future,

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:52.920
we're going to pay a $1 dividend.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.880
So for every share of stock
that you own, you'll get $1.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.730
What do you think is going to happen to
the price of this stock between now and

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.950
the date of that dividend?

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.850
Let me give you a little bit
more information that might make

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.530
things simpler.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.885
Let's suppose that the consensus
on the value of the company,

00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:14.820
by whatever means you've
determined that consensus,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.210
is that the company is
worth $100 per share.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.180
So on this date, in order to we get
that $1 dividend, we're going to have

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.147
one share of the company that people
think is worth $100 per share and

00:01:28.147 --> 00:01:29.490
we will have $1.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.450
So on this date, we'll have one share of
a company supposedly worth $100 and $1.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.180
So think about it.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.670
What prices will we see
this stock converge to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.930
on the day before the dividend is paid
and the day the dividend is paid?
