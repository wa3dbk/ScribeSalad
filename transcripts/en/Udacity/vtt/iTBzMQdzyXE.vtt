00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.906
Here's a more challenging problem with the Pythagorean Theorem. This time, you

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:09.010
have a right triangle whose hypotenuse is 5 inches longer than its longer leg.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.792
If the shorter leg is 5 inches shorter than the longer leg, what are the side

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:17.086
lengths of the triangle? Before you solve for each of the sides of the

00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:20.248
triangle, I want you to try and use the information in the problem to come up

00:00:20.248 --> 00:00:25.830
with expressions for each of these. So you want to write an expression for the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.436
hypotenuse the shorter leg and the longer leg. Be sure you use the variable x

00:00:30.436 --> 00:00:34.587
when you write the expressions. You'll need to think carefully about how each

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:38.310
of these is related to one another. Good luck here.
