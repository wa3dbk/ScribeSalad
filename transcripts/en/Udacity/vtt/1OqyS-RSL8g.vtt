00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.800
Decision trees are directed graphs.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.010
There is no recursion.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.080
You can't loop back.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.708
You only go one way one time,
and time is not represented.

00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:15.680
Here's a classic generic
clinical decision strategy

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.460
where different treatment choices
yield different outcomes.
