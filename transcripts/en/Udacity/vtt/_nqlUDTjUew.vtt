00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.840
As you know, in Linux they use the term task to signify a schedulable entity.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.150
And so, we're using T1, T2, T3, to mean tasks, which are

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.590
schedulable entities. And the timer-q data structure, what it contains is the

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:25.810
tasks and the expiry time for that particular task. And the tasks are ordered in

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.420
this Timer-q data structure maintained by the kernel, sorted

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.600
by the expiry time. So task T1 is the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.955
earliest task to go off. Because it has the

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:38.222
earliest expiry time. T2 is next, with an expiry time

00:00:38.222 --> 00:00:43.410
of 12. T3 with an expiry time of 15 and so on. So this is the way the kernel

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.250
is maintaining the data structure to know when a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.070
particular task's expiry time is up for processing the event

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.800
associated with that particular task. The basis for firm timer implementation

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.760
is the availability of APIC hardware.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.550
APIC is advanced programmable interrupt controller,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.830
which is implemented on chip in modern CPU starting from Intel Pentium

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.250
onwards, and the firm timer implementation in TS-Linux takes advantage of the

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.180
APIC hardware. The good news is with

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.400
the APIC timer hardware, re-programming a one shot

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.340
timer takes only a few cycles. So there

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.270
is not a significant overhead to re-programming a

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.560
one shot timer on modern CPUs because of the availability of the APIC hardware.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.330
So if the task that is at the head of the queue, that had it's timer event go

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.380
off, if it has to be reprogrammed, all that we need to do is

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.850
execute a few instructions in modern processes

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.060
to reprogram that one shot timer to go

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.220
off at the next one shot interval. When the APIC timer

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.360
expires, the interrupt handler will go through this timer-q

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.530
data structures and look for tasks whose timers have expired.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.270
Some of these tasks may be periodic tasks, some of these tasks may have been

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.080
programmed to deal with the APIC timer

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.530
event. So, associated with each entry in this

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.290
timer queue data structure is the callback

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.420
handler for dealing with that particular event. And

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.070
those callback handlers are going to be

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.170
called by the interrupt handler upon the expiry

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.290
of the APIC timer. The expired timers are going to be removed from those timer

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.730
queue data structures. If the entry corresponds to

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.102
a periodic timer, then the handler will re

00:02:44.102 --> 00:02:47.510
enqueue that particular task in the timer

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.030
queue data structure after updating its expiry field

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.640
for the next periodic event for that task. If it is a one shot timer that

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.230
this task was using. In that case, the interrupt handler will reprogramme that

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.890
task for the next one short event. The way the APIC timer hardware works is

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.620
by setting a value into register which is decremented at each memory bus cycle

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.860
until it reaches zero. At which point it'll generate an interrupt. Now given a

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.900
100 megahertz memory bus, for instance, on modern CPUs, a one short timer has

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.060
a theoretical accuracy of ten nanoseconds. However,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.570
in practice, the time needed to feel

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.806
the timer interrupt is significantly higher. And

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:42.512
that becomes the limiting factor in the

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:45.054
granularity that you can get with one

00:03:45.054 --> 00:03:48.582
shot timers implemented using the APIC hardware.

00:03:48.582 --> 00:03:55.050
But the important point is that APIC hardware allows you to implement very fine

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.265
grained timers in modern processes. And as I already mentioned, by choosing an

00:04:01.265 --> 00:04:05.498
appropriate overshoot parameter in reprogramming the epic

00:04:05.498 --> 00:04:08.634
timer. We can eliminate the need for

00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:11.474
fielding one shot interrupts, because of soft

00:04:11.474 --> 00:04:15.410
timers going off within that overshoot period.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.870
Another optimization that we can do, in the

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.270
firm time at implementation, is looking at the distance

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.960
between one shot events. For instance, in this

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.590
picture I'm showing you, the long distance between two

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.410
one shot events. There is a one shot

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.250
event happening here. There is a one shot timer

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.560
event happening here. Another one shot timer event happening

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.600
here. And if you have such a long distance,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.010
it is possible that there may be several

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.810
periodic timer events that may be going off

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.080
within this long distance. So this suggests that

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.910
if periodic events are going to go off, and

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.730
if it is close enough to a one shot timer that would have gone off, why not take

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:05.630
advantage of that? So what we want to do is dispatch a one shot event at

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.080
a preceding periodic event. The key thing for

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.690
time sensitivity is not missing the timer event.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.540
If you're going to process it a little

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.870
bit sooner, that's okay. So that's exactly what

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.820
is happening here. Just as in the case

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.810
of the overshoot parameter being used in combing

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.270
one shot to the soft timer. What we're

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.756
doing here is, because periodic timers are going

00:05:30.756 --> 00:05:33.910
to interrupt anyhow and if the kernel notices

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.400
that there is a one shot event that is

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.969
coming up fairly soon, then it can simply dispatch

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:43.538
that one shot event at the preceding periodic timer

00:05:43.538 --> 00:05:47.345
event that is any how accepting the processor. And

00:05:47.345 --> 00:05:50.461
once you do that, then you can reprogram this

00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:52.757
one shot event to go off at the next

00:05:52.757 --> 00:05:56.765
expiry point for that one shot event. So basically,

00:05:56.765 --> 00:06:02.765
what we're doing when we have a long distance between one shot events,

00:06:02.765 --> 00:06:08.765
is to use a preceding periodic timer event, so that we can both avoid the

00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:15.520
overhead of dealing with this one shot event. And also the cost of reprogramming

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.850
it. Or in other words, we completely

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.580
eliminate using one shot events for situations

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.180
where the distance between the one shot events is so big that we can simply use

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.306
the periodic event instead of the one shot

00:06:31.306 --> 00:06:34.230
event. And the reasons for doing that are twofold.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.230
One is, periodic event data structures are much

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.559
more efficient than the kernel, they're order of one

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:44.490
data structures. Whereas, the one shot event programming

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.846
data structures in the kernel. Tends to be order

00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:53.850
of log n, where n is the number of active timers. So as an optimization,

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.900
if the one shot events happen at fairly long distances. That there are several

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.140
periodic events that are going to happen

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.780
anyhow within that. We will simply use the

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.590
periodic timers instead of the one shot

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.090
timer. So to summarize, the firm timer implementation.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:19.440
The first point is that the APIC hardware allows reprogramming one shot timers

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.260
in few cycles. And secondly, by choosing

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.100
the appropriate overshoot distance, we can eliminate

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:33.080
the need for fielding the one shot timer interrupts if soft timers go off within

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.120
that overshoot period. And third, if the distance between one shot timers is

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.830
really long, then instead of using one shot timers, we will simply

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.790
use periodic timers and dispatch the one shot

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:52.920
event at the preceding periodic timer event. Those are the ideas that

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.190
are enshrined in the firm timer implementation in TS-Linux, that

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.200
essentially combines the advantages of one shot timer with

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.010
soft timers with periodic timers. So this should give you a feel

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:13.590
for how TS-Linux, by a clever implementation,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:18.560
reduces the timer latency, the first component of the

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.500
latency from the point of event happening to event activation.
