00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
First we're going to talk about correctness.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The question is what property do we need

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in order for RSA to be invertible?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And let me remind you the encryption and decryption functions.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Here are the possible choices.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Which one of these do we need in order for the RSA encryption system

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to provide the correctness property that we can invert messages

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
encrypted with a public key by using the private key?
