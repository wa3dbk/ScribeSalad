00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.710
Alright, you're done. 
Let's start by adding

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.130
all of the strings we're going 
to need for our new preference.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.278
Key, label, and some things like 
true, false, and default.

00:00:10.278 --> 00:00:14.010
Then we'll additional preference 
into pref general xnl,

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.560
a check box preference 
that uses those strings we just defined.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.850
Let's go over to our sync adaptor. 
In the notify function,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.820
we add the code to fetch the preference

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.480
and make use of it. 
And there we have it.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.020
Now we won't display notifications 
if the user doesn't want us to,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.540
which is a great thing for an app to do.
