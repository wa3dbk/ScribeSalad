00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.500
The length of the rectangle is 12 units long and the width is 9 units. Great

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.500
work if you found these two numbers. The key to this problem is that the

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.853
diagonal is 15 inches long. The diagonal rectangle cuts from one corner to an

00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:18.348
opposite corner. So, we can draw in this line and consider this to be one of

00:00:18.348 --> 00:00:23.342
the diagonals. This line would be the other diagonal. But we only need 1

00:00:23.342 --> 00:00:28.639
triangle in order to figure out the side links of our rectangle. We know the

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:33.854
diagonal is 15 inches long so we can label this with 15. We'll let the width of

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:39.250
the rectangle be x. Since we know the length is 3 inches longer than the width.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.550
This means that the length must be x plus 3. Here again is another. We're using

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.340
algebra to relate two things. We have one unknown which is the width, and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.690
relating to the length. Since the length is three inches longer than the width.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.358
Now we have a right triangle and we're ready to use the pythagoreum theorem to

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:04.215
solve for x. Whole squared e to the legs which is this side and this side and

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:08.440
we know if we sum those squares together we'll get the squared hypotenuse or 15

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.404
squared. We'll combine these like terms together to get 2x squared plus 6x plus

00:01:15.404 --> 00:01:20.932
9 equals 225. Next we'll subtract 225 from those sides so I have this quadratic

00:01:20.932 --> 00:01:26.416
expression said equal to 0. These terms are all even, so we can divide our

00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:34.406
equation through by 2. This gives us x squared plus 3 x minus 108 equals 0. We

00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:40.608
find factors of negative 108 that sum to positive 3. Those factors are negative

00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:45.460
9 and positive 12. So, we can write these two factors and then set each one

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.712
equal to 0 to solve for x. So, X can equal positive nine, or X can equal

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:56.248
negative 12. A negative side length wouldn't make sense in this case, so we'll

00:01:56.248 --> 00:02:01.472
let X equal 9 here. So, if the width is 9, then we know that the length must be

00:02:01.472 --> 00:02:07.206
3 more than the width, or, this would be 12 units. Again, great algebra

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:08.930
thinking if you got these two numbers.
