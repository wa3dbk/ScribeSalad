00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.800
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know the slope can be calculated by the difference in the y values,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.015
divided by the difference of the x values. The rise divided by the run. I'm

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:15.783
going to label this point x2, y2 and this point x1, y1. So, y2 is 0 and y1 is 2.

00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:20.732
Then x2 is 3 and x1 is 0. Notice again that I'm always using parenthesis when I

00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:24.627
substitute in numbers. This is so I don't make a mistake with negative signs.

00:00:24.627 --> 00:00:28.661
When I carry out the subtraction, I get negative two thirds. Negative two thirds

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:32.219
was the slope. But wouldn't it be easier if we could just read it from the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.925
equation? It's not as easy to read off the slope from an equation written in

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:39.942
standard form, as it was with an equation written in slope-intercept form. But

00:00:39.942 --> 00:00:41.408
you can still find the slope.
