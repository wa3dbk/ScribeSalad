00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.350
There's another tool that provides the
same kind of information as host does,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.570
but in a more technical and
complete form.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.850
So the host tool shows more human
readable information, spelled out in

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.474
English sentences like, such and so
name is an alias for this other name.

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:22.550
Or this name has address 52.25.84.3.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.560
The dig tool shows the same
information more or less.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.180
But in a form that's more readable for
scripts and

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.920
is closer to the way that it's stored
in the DNS server's configuration file.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.250
Let's take a look.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.600
So here I did dig www.udacity.com,
and here we see a question

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.490
section that says, what is the request
that we sent to the DNS system?

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.420
And an answer section that
says what we got back.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.650
See, here's the name that
host says was an alias.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.030
We can see as we saw before
alias is done with CNAME.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.540
And here's the name that host
said it was an alias too.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.860
And likewise, these names have
A records with the IP addresses.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.170
But dig also gives us other information.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.530
It tells us what server
answered our query.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.890
It tells us some metadata like,
when the query was answered.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.960
And it also includes some other
fields that say how the query worked.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.480
We won't go into those in this course.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.600
But it's worth noting that you can get a
lot of information out of DNS this way.
