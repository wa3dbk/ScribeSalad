00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.074
You can see here that the cost to make 92 wiper sets is equal to 598. But we

00:00:04.086 --> 00:00:08.306
also see in the last equation, that the cost to make 92 wiper sets is equal to

00:00:08.318 --> 00:00:12.452
the cost to make one wiper set times the number of wiper sets made. Now, when

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:16.792
two quantities are both equal to the same thing, that means they're also equal

00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:21.138
to each other. That means we can say that 598 equals the cost to make one wiper

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.456
set times the number of wiper sets made. That's actually really just another

00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:29.477
case of substitution. So, we can put a 598 in this spot, and we're going to

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.969
continue to leave dollar signs out for now just for simplicity. You see the cost

00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:38.027
to make one wiper set, both here and the last equation, and also here that it's

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:42.816
equal to c. So, let's substitute c in and the number wiper sets made is 92. Now,

00:00:42.828 --> 00:00:48.144
we have an equation. 598 equals c times 92. There's one slight adjustment that

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:53.291
I'm going to make. I'm going to say that 598 equals 92c. So, remember that we

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:58.748
normally write the coefficients, just plain numbers, at the front of terms and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.947
then the variables following them. So, look at that. After a lot of hard work,

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:09.515
we finally have a lovely, concise equation. 598 equals 92c. I'm going to put a

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:11.595
nice little box around that.
