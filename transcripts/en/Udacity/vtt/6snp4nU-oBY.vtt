00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.452
Well, this x intercept is three units to the left of 0, so that's negative 3 for

00:00:05.452 --> 00:00:10.642
the x coordinate. And I don't move vertically up or down, so the y coordinate

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:15.697
must be 0. For the y intercept, we don't move left and we don't move right, so

00:00:15.697 --> 00:00:20.241
the x coordinate is 0. Then, I move two units up, so positive 2 in the y

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:21.067
direction.
