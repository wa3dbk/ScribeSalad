00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.563
Let's try another problem multipying rational expressions. Again, we're going to

00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:08.343
break this problem into two parts, first I want you to factor each part of the

00:00:08.343 --> 00:00:11.943
fractions and then we're going to cancel the factors that appear and the

00:00:11.943 --> 00:00:15.470
numerator and denominators in the second part. You can write the factor

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.490
expressions here in the corresponding boxes. Be sure you use all that you know

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.534
about factoring. Look for a greatest common factor first and then use your

00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:27.439
knowledge of factoring patterns and factoring by grouping if necessary.
