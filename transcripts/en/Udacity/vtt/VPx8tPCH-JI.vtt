00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.349
And the answer here may be surprisingly is that using this random assignment here

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:09.030
we will on average already get half of the variables right

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.620
and that is of course because we have a 50% chance for each single variable

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.830
of actually getting it right when we do it by coin flip

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.730
because if in a satisfying assignment this variable needs to be set to false,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.170
there's a 50% chance that a random assignment will also set it to false

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.890
and if it needs to be set to true, there is also 50% chance that we actually set it to true

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.090
using this randomized assignment.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.600
Now, of course, sometimes we might get more variables correct and sometimes less

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.770
but especially if N is large we can expect to get about half of the variables right in an average run.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.680
Now, the success-factor II, once we are half way there so to say

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.440
what are the chances that using this process here will get us through the satisfying assignment

00:00:54.440 --> 99:59:59.000
again, if the original Boolean formula actually has one of those.
