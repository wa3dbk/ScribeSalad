00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.290
The goal of working with a model computer instead of a real computer is that

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.270
we want to have a machine, which is as easy as possible

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.660
but still let us capture the main aspects of a real computer.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.430
And the reason why you want to have a simple computer is that a real computer contains

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.240
lots of parts that are not really interesting when we want to analyze an algorithm

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.570
and also you might have different computers that run at different speeds

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.400
but actually that doesn't really say something about your algorithm.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.350
In the next year, when the faster computer model comes along,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.430
you can already run your algorithm a bit faster but that doesn't really say

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.240
that your algorithm has become better.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.280
So our goal here is to strip down a computer that you used to to a model that is as simple as possible

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.300
but still has basically the same capabilities as a real computer.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.430
So we will do this as a quiz and what I want you to think about is what are the essential components

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.250
for having a minimal computer model.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.340
And what I mean by essential is that the computer must still be able to solve problems

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.260
to perform any computation that this machine here could but also not anymore.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.260
So what I would like you do is to check off each of those boxes

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.260
if you think that this component of a computer is essential to keep in a computer model.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.260
So do you need a memory to store your results in?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.270
Do you need a graphics card? Some sort of input and output?

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.200
Do you need a mouse? Do you need a monitor? Some sort of file system?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.460
An operating system? Programming capabilities? Or a CD-ROM?

00:01:42.460 --> 99:59:59.000
And keep in mind that we are looking for a model that is as simple as possible.
