00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.120
Here are the more elaborate organization of the hardware resources inside a

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.280
computer system with an I/O Bus and a system Bus, and usually the system

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.320
Bus, is a synchronous communication device between the CPU and the memory.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:25.330
The I/O bus is primarily intended for the devices to communicate with the CPU.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.630
And the intent is that the individual needs of each of these devices, in terms

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.520
of the communication bandwidth that they may need,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.050
is less than the cumulative bandwidth that may

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.290
be available for the CPU to communicate with

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.350
the memory. Or in other words, the system

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.470
bus has a communication bandwidth that is much

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.690
more than the communication bandwidth that's available in

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.710
the I/O bus. So the system bus is a high speed bus and it connects via a bridge

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.710
to the I/O bus. And this bridge itself, could be a specialized IO processor

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.090
for scheduling the devices that need to communicate

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.480
with the memory for instance, if it is

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.030
a DMA device or need to communicate with the CPU if it's a slow speed device.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.630
So the role of the bridge is like a processor in itself. Controlling

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.390
who has access to this I/O bus among the set of devices that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.360
maybe competing at the same time for attention by the CPU and

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.272
communicating the intent of these I/O devices either directly with

00:01:36.272 --> 00:01:41.080
the memory or via the CPU. The I/O bus is typically lower speed

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.050
than the higher speed system bus. And the cumulative

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.180
bandwidth that is needed in the system bus is

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.160
usually much higher because it has to cater to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.180
all the clients that may want to access the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.340
memory, either from the CPU or from any of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.460
these devices coming through this bridge. There may be

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.410
other high-speed devices, for example, a frame buffer, of

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.220
a graphics display that may also be hanging off of

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.050
the system bus due to the need for refreshing the screen in a rapid manner from

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.570
the memory. So in a nut shell, if you look at the internal organization of a

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.470
computer system that are going to be one or

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.257
more CPUs, whether it is a single-core machine

00:02:26.257 --> 00:02:28.940
or multi-core machine or parallel machine and so

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.665
on. You're going to have one or more CPUs and

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:37.480
youre going to have a bunch of memory that the CPUs can access and there's

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.860
going to be a whole number of input-output devices. And device controllers that

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.700
allow these devices to communicate with the CPU, or

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.200
directly with the memory. And there are conduits, system bus and I/O bus,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.080
for connecting these controllers to the CPU as well as

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.650
to the memory. Basically, these conduits allow ferrying data from the CPU to the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:12.220
devices, or from the devices to the CPU, and between CPU and the memory,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.940
as well as from the devices to the memory. This is why I mentioned

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.760
earlier that there is no difference in

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.720
the organization, regardless of the platform specifics,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.990
the form factor may be different, or the intended use may be different

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.390
of a particular platform. But the internal

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.350
organization is pretty much going to look as

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.890
I've shown you here in terms of the hardware elements that are going to be

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.470
there as well as the connectivity that

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.000
you might see among these hardware elements.
