00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.655
There is a quicker way to think about our process though. When simplifying

00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:08.639
radicals that involve variables, we want to remember power divided by root. For

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.608
example, if we wanted to simplify the square root of x to the fourth, we would

00:00:12.608 --> 00:00:18.558
do the power of the 4 divided by the root 2, so we would get x squared. We're

00:00:18.558 --> 00:00:23.600
dividing this power by our index of 2, since it's the square root. This should

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.810
also make sense because x to the 4th can be rewritten as x squared times x

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.420
squared. We have a repeated factor here so we can pull out x squared. We can

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.160
use this same approach of power divided by root for higher order roots like

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.350
cube roots, fourth roots and fifth roots. So how do you think we could simplify

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.343
this radical? Write your answer here.
