00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.682
Now, if we found that 2 plus 3i and 2 minus 3i are both roots of some

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:10.186
polynomial, then we also already know two factors of this polynomial. Those

00:00:10.186 --> 00:00:17.300
factors are x minus the quantity 2 plus 3i and x minus the quantity 2 minus 3i.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.740
If we know that both of these are factors of some polynomial, then they're

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.535
going to be multiplied together to help create it's equation. So, what's an

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:28.472
equation of a polynomial that only has these two factors? I've written them out

00:00:28.472 --> 00:00:31.893
as multiplied for you right here. But, I'd like you to expand this

00:00:31.893 --> 00:00:35.457
multiplication and simplify, writing the final version of this polynomial in

00:00:35.457 --> 00:00:37.229
this blue box.
