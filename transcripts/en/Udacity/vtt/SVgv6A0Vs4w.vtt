00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Before looking at how that works, I want to demonstrate

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
what happens when we connect using TLS in the browser.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Different browsers deal with TLS in different ways.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If we connect to https://www.google.com that's using SSL to connect,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we can see in the address bar it's indicating that it's a secured connection.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If we click on that, we can see more information about that.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We are connected to the site google.com, unknown who it's run by,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and it is verified by a certificate provided by Thawte Consulting Ltd,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and we can click on this to get more information about that key.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This has the information about the certificate, and we can click on the certificate to see what it was.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It says our communication between the sites is now being encrypted.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
As the result of the Handshake Protocol, the client and the server have agreed on the key,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and now all the messages between our client and the server are encrypted using that key.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If we look at the certificate, we'll see more information

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
about how that was established, and we have an SSL server certificate.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It indicates who it was issued to, so it was issued to www.google.com.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That matches the name of the site we connected to,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and it explains who issued the certificate, and it has fingerprints for the certificate.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We can also see that it has an expiration date.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Certificates don't last forever. That's an important property.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If the certificate lasted forever, we'd have to have a very strong encryption on it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
By making it expire, the key license needed for the certificate

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
can be predicted based on expected computing power until the expiration time.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We can see more if we look in the details.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This is where we get into the real issue of how the certificates work--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that there is a chain of authorities that validate the certificate.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We'll talk about that more soon and then look at this again.
