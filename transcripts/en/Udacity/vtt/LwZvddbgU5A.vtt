00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
There's a couple mistakes when you're thinking about value proposition.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.780
One is that what you're building might just be a feature of someone else's product.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.260
You might have a good feature extension, but it might not be a business,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.250
or it might be a business for about 9 months

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.379
till the incumbent just adds that in their next release.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.550
As I said earlier, these prioritizations of pains and gains

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.940
sometimes helps you avoid the "it's nice to have" problem.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.340
Sometimes it's very easy for founders to say, "Well, they all liked it."

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.610
Well, okay. What you really want is they didn't like it; they've got to have it.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.150
In fact, they didn't let me leave until they let me use the prototype.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.810
That's when you know you have a business.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.960
It has to be something that people demand,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.790
and there have to be enough of them to demand.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.760
You might find, yeah, I found the 5 people in the entire world that love the product,

00:00:48.760 --> 99:59:59.000
but that might not be a large enough market.
