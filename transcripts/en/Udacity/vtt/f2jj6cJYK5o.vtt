00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.930
One important feature of inverse functions that we haven't really talked about,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.590
is the fact that they are, well, functions. Here for example, are the functions

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.668
we were working with in the last quiz. We started out with the equation y

00:00:12.668 --> 00:00:17.592
equals 4x, and found that its inverse is y equals x over 4. Of course, the

00:00:17.592 --> 00:00:20.886
original equation is a function, but we can tell that its inverse is too. It

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:24.880
passes the vertical line test. We saw that y equals 4 over x is its own

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.770
inverse. It passes the vertical line test, too. Another fun fact about this, is

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.670
you can tell that it's its own inverse, because the function itself is

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.524
symmetric across the line y equals x. Now if we had a function and we went

00:00:37.524 --> 00:00:41.022
through the process of finding its inverse, but the resulting equation did not

00:00:41.022 --> 00:00:46.430
graph a function, then the original function would not have an inverse at all.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.980
I know that sounds kind of complicated and that would involve a lot of steps.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.004
So luckily, there's an easier way to tell whether or not a function will have

00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:58.586
an inverse. It involves graphing. Now I just said that we can figure out if a

00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:03.286
graph represents a function by using the vertical line test. And we also know

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:06.510
that in order to graph the inverse of a function, we need to reflect it in the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.417
line y equals x. So, what if we decided to reflect a vertical line in the line

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:17.512
y equals x? Here, I've graphed a random vertical line. I happen to pick x

00:01:17.512 --> 00:01:22.530
equals 4. And this dotted black line is the line y equals x. What is the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.982
reflection of x equals 4 in the line y equals x? Please write the equation of

00:01:27.982 --> 00:01:30.419
this new line in this box.
