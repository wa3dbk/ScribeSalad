00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.670
Interestingly, all the cloud
computing is a relatively new trend.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.800
As a vision, it existed for
a very long time.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.280
The oldest description,
by John McCarthy,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.690
predates the technology by almost half
a century, and it appeared in 61.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.090
He said the following.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.950
If the computers of the kind I have
advocated become the computers of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.960
the future, then computing may some
day be organized as a public utility,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.760
just as the telephone
system is a public utility.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.890
The computer utility could become
the basis of a new and important future.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.220
If you look at this statement,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.140
it describes a vision where computing
is a utility just like other utilities.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.120
If we need more electricity,
we just turn the switch on.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.720
We don't worry about where
the electricity actually comes from.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.730
Based on this vision, cloud computing
should turn the IP resource

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.450
into a fungible utility, where we
don't care about what type of CPUs or

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.150
disk I'll ultimately use or
where they are.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.410
Virtualization technology is one
enabling the process, certainly.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.190
Unfortunately there's still
limitations before this vision of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.430
just seamless computing
utility can be realized.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.920
For instance, even with virtualization
there's still some hardware dependencies

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.850
that simply cannot be masked.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.770
So if software expects a certain type
of hardware plot form to execute then

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.920
we cannot just have it run
on another type of resource.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.910
Then there is the API lock-in where if
we're using a particular cloud provider

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.610
then we're expected to
continue using those API's.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.920
There isn't a uniform standard
across cloud providers.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.250
And then, unlike with some of these
other utilities, where we're simply

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.830
bringing this resource, the electricity
in, in the case of cloud computing

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.660
we're putting data, potentially core
business services out in the cloud.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.095
So some of the privacy and security
concerns become much more important.

00:01:57.095 --> 00:02:01.795
Clearly latency's is an issue given that
there is an actual geographic distance

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:06.514
related to our axis to our.
