00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.774
This lesson doesn't quite fit in with this unit, but the topic is important

00:00:02.774 --> 00:00:06.640
enough that I'll cover it here. As we move the camera or objects through a

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.896
scene, models become larger and smaller. For very large scenes with many

00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:13.886
objects, rendering everything in the scene at full detail can make us lose any

00:00:13.886 --> 00:00:18.353
shred of interactivity. We've seen how there are limits to how large a texture

00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:21.113
needs to be, in fact it's usually best if the texel to pixel ratio stays at

00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:25.483
about one to one. More than that and the texture can just become a source of

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:29.168
noise. Choosing the proper data representation is part of a much wider topic

00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:33.346
called level of detail. In this area of computer graphics, the focus is on how

00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:38.241
to change an object's representation as its size on the screen changes. Methods

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:42.514
must balance tradeoffs between performance and quality. The two major areas

00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:46.165
where level of detail techniques come into play are with meshes and textures.

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:49.441
Textures can be down sampled to create mid maps so that proper texture level

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:53.660
can be used for a scene. As a textured object gets farther away a smaller

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.370
texture on the mid map is needed. There also limits for how much memory a GPU

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.504
has available for texture storage. For very large data sets such as a city or

00:01:02.504 --> 00:01:05.624
world map, it's impossible to save all the high resolution textures in memory

00:01:05.624 --> 00:01:10.568
at the same time. Since we know that when an object is small on the screen, it

00:01:10.568 --> 00:01:14.330
will need only a lower resolution texture. We can design our system to load

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.301
only the low resolution textures out of the mip chain. As we zoom in on a

00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:22.230
particular object We can load the higher and higher resolution textures. At the

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.090
same time, we can be deleting the higher resolution textures for objects that

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.180
are now receding from view, or have been clipped off the screen entirely. As an

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.880
object gets smaller on the screen, we can also consider simplifying the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.240
illumination equation. In other words using shaders with fewer instructions.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.620
For example, if we get far away enough from an object, its displacement map may

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.015
add very little detail. Displacement maps help in particular by giving a more

00:01:44.015 --> 00:01:47.885
realistic silhouette to an object. At a distance, these fine details are less

00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:51.672
important. As an object gets smaller, switching from a displacement map to a

00:01:51.672 --> 00:01:56.250
normal map then to no bump map at all saves considerable amounts of memory.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.521
Mesh geometry itself can be thought of in the same terms. As a mesh gets

00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:03.683
smaller on the screen, fewer vertices are needed to represent its details. For

00:02:03.683 --> 00:02:06.947
objects that are tessellated into triangles, this means a smaller tessellation

00:02:06.947 --> 00:02:10.529
factor can be given. For more complex objects that do not have a simple

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.812
tessellation factor, simplified meshes have to be either created by hand, or by

00:02:13.812 --> 00:02:18.560
what's called the decimation algorithm. Such algorithms try to find the least

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.330
important triangles and patch up their areas with fewer triangles. Here's an

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.395
example by Paolo Cignoni using mesh lab, a powerful and free mesh manipulator.

00:02:27.395 --> 00:02:30.410
This automatic techniques are effective but can run into problems with objects

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.380
such as faces, where the lips and eyes should be subject to less simplification

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.182
because of their importance. In mipmapping we interpolate between two textures

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:41.927
in the mip pyramid. With level of detail techniques for geometry, we can do the

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:46.090
same with what are called geomorphs. This technique can provide a smoother

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.390
transition between levels of detail, but at the cost of additional processing

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.440
and memory, which is in opposition to much of the point of using of level of

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.544
detail techniques in the first place. It's much more common to simply replace a

00:02:57.544 --> 00:03:01.653
model with its simplified version when it becomes smaller on the screen. You

00:03:01.653 --> 00:03:04.910
sometimes see a pop if the two versions of the model differ considerably. 3JS

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.022
supports this form of level of detail. In this demo, you can see different

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.378
versions of the sphere model being used depending on the distance from the

00:03:11.378 --> 00:03:15.613
viewer. These were explicitly chosen by the programmer. If you look closely,

00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:17.489
you'll see four different levels of detail.
