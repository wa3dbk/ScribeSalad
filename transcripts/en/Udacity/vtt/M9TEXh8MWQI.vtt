Variable delay is a property of statistical multiplexing,or packet

00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:07.670
switching. Circuit switch networks can have busy signals. Packet switch

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.930
networks share network resources. And circuit switch networks typically have

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.680
dedicated resources along a path, between the sender and receiver
