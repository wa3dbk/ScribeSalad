00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.910
So, luckily, this is already factored as much as it can be. We need to solve

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.738
the equations, x squared plus 1 equals zero. And x plus 2 equals zero. The

00:00:10.738 --> 00:00:17.165
first one gives us i and negative i. And the second one tells us that the only

00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:22.952
real zero, or root, in this case, is negative 2. Remember, though, there are

00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:28.806
three solutions to this problem. I, negative i, and negative 2.
