00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.700
Queries are specified in a health
quality measure format or

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.540
HQMF for short.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.330
This is an XML standard for documenting
the content and structure of a quality

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.000
measure using an XML document
formatted based on the HL7 REM.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.329
It consists of three levels of detail.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.220
Metadata, such as who wrote it,
the dates over which it is valid,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.520
who validated it, and other details
about how the measure works or is used.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.340
Human narrative, including measured
description, data criteria,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.310
the measure population,
and measure observations.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.780
Finally, computer instructions
As to how to count and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.700
compute the results of the measure.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.220
This is a small part of the XML
in a HQMF query specification.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.100
In this case,
it provides instructions to the computer

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.370
to only include patients who
have had their weight measured.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.180
This might define the numerator of
a weight screening quality metric.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.980
That as you recall from lesson two,
is a requirement in meaningful use.
