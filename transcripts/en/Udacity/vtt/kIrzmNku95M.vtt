00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.542
Now we have the slope of our line, and we still note two points that it passes

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:09.075
through. Can you use this information to figure out the equation of our line?

00:00:09.178 --> 00:00:13.576
Please write it in this box. Just a hint, think about how you can use slope

00:00:13.588 --> 00:00:18.059
intercept form to do this. If you're having trouble remembering what slope

00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:21.932
intercept form is, you can just go back a few videos and review it.
