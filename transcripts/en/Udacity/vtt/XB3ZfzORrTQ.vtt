The last term in this section that we're going to talk about is the idea of

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.709
metacognitive thinking. In metacognitive thinking, is the process that includes

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:14.220
the ability to first think and then to reflect on one's own thinking. So it's

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.022
thinking about thinking. So if you ponder how to solve a particular problem,

00:00:19.022 --> 00:00:22.926
and you first think about the solution and then you think about the process to

00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:28.806
get to that solution, that's metacognitive thinking. Now this ability is not

00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:33.362
universal. Without specific training, many people have difficulty questioning

00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:35.100
their own thinking.
