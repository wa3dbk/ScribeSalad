00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.820
&gt;&gt; Cameron just showed you how to solve problems based on solutions developed by

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.551
other people.

00:00:04.551 --> 00:00:06.903
Now this is a common practice in web development.

00:00:06.903 --> 00:00:08.256
So let's ask Jacques and

00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:12.320
see how he approaches problem solving in his everyday work.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.258
I've got this broccoli stuffed animal.

00:00:14.258 --> 00:00:15.961
Let's see if we can get his attention.

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:26.044
&gt;&gt; So problem solving on the web is not exactly fun.

00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:28.423
But when you run into an issue with HTML or CSS,

00:00:28.423 --> 00:00:32.327
the chances that somebody else has run into that same issue are pretty good,

00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:34.404
especially when you're starting out.

00:00:34.404 --> 00:00:38.080
So checking sites like Stack Overflow.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.060
Searching around on the web for

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.780
sort of the same type of problem you're experiencing.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.813
This doesn't fit over that.

00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:47.680
Why is this shifting down below here?

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.150
Those sorts of things will most times yield the answer you're looking for.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.360
One of the great things about the fact that there are so many people doing web

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.610
development is that those people run into the same types of problems.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.960
So go check Stack Overflow.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.970
Go check out the web.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.210
You can probably find the answer that you're looking for.
