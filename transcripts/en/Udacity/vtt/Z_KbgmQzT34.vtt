00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.114
To understand how our brains develop, we need to understand a bit about how

00:00:03.114 --> 00:00:07.290
genetic information is used to build them. So, let's bring back Matt, our

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.695
resident genetics expert. So, Matt, how does your body know how to build you?

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:15.973
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Virtually, every cell in your body, including your brain cells has all the

00:00:15.973 --> 00:00:22.007
information necessary to build you. Inside every cell resides the genetic

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:27.745
construction or DNA that is arranged in 23 pairs of chromosomes.

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:32.395
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wait, so I know that DNA is the blueprint for making a living thing, but what

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:35.630
role do chromosomes play?

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.758
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; chromosomes are actually long strands of DNA wrapped around proteins. You've

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:45.930
probably seen pictures of them before. It's how our cells organize this

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.140
information structurally.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.965
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; so, that's cool, but how does it translate into who I am, or who you are?

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:59.824
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, DNA is made up of four building blocks, called nucleotides. Adenine,

00:00:59.824 --> 00:01:06.062
Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine. We usually refer to just the letters. A, T, G

00:01:06.062 --> 00:01:12.245
and C. You have over 3 billion of these letters in a unique sequence that makes

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:19.080
up who you are. And your cells use this as a set of instructions to create you.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.920
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wow, 3 billion sounds like a lot. I wonder how that compares to other living

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.709
organisms?
