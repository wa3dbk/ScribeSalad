Okay, so let's recap with a little quiz.

00:00:01.803 --> 00:00:04.926
GPU can do the following, so
mark each one that's true.

00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:09.815
One, initiate a send data
from the GPU to the CPU.

00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:14.110
Two, respond to a CPU request
to send data from GPU to CPU.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.540
Three, initiate or
receive of data sent from CPU to GPU.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.540
Four, respond to a CPU request
to receive data from CPU to GPU.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.865
Five, compute a kernel
launched by the CPU.

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:30.451
Six, and there's no box here so
don't check and don't not check.

00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:32.700
Compute a kernel launched by the GPU.
