00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.005
Here, the solutions are 5 plus or minus root 6, all divided by 2. Amazing work

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.611
if you got these answers. Here, we want to use the square root method since we

00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:14.008
have a perfect square on one side of our equation. We square root both sides,

00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:19.166
indicating the plus or minus on the right. So we'll have 2x minus 5 equals plus

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:24.178
or minus root 6. We add 5 to both sides to isolate 2x, and then we divide both

00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:30.310
sides by 2 to get 1x is equal to 5 halves plus or minus root 6 divided by 2. We

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.665
can leave our answers separated as two fractions or add and subtract them

00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:36.290
together to leave them like this.
