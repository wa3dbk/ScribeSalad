00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.375
Another situation in which nested loops often arise is image editing. In the

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:08.096
past we've traversed the pixels of an image in a single loop going a row at a

00:00:08.096 --> 00:00:12.516
time. But there are many situations when it makes more sense to make separate

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:16.690
loops for the rows and columns. For example suppose that we want to have this

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.644
effect where we hide all of the pixels that are outside the circle. In this

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:26.774
case, you will want to know what the x and y position of the pixels are. Given

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:30.804
values for x and y, you can get a pixel by calling a method called getColorAt

00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:34.769
and similarly there's a setColorAt that let's you set the color at an x and y

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.447
location. To get this effect then, we will want to loop through all of the

00:00:40.447 --> 00:00:43.867
possible x's and all of the possible y's with coordinates x, y and see how

00:00:43.867 --> 00:00:49.750
close it is to the center point. If this distance is less than the radius of

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.233
the circle, then we want to leave the pixel untouched. But for a point out

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:57.773
here, where the distance is greater than the radius, we want to color this

00:00:57.773 --> 00:01:03.100
point black by calling setColorAt. Here's the outline of the program. Two

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.635
nested loops for all values of x and y. Compute the distance. The problem gives

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:11.057
you the general formula for computing that and then go ahead and do the

00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:12.670
coloring.
