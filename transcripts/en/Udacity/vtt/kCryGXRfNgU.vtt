00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.745
Now this brings us to the next area of study in motivation in the workplace,

00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:08.990
and that is intrinsic motivation. An intrinsic motivation comes from within the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.549
person, and it includes four elements. First we have challenge, and that is how

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.440
much you enjoy the thrill and excitement of challenges. The second is

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.460
enjoyment. And that is how much pleasure you receive from the process of doing

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.477
a task. Mastery is our next term. And this is whether you gain a sense of

00:00:29.477 --> 00:00:34.580
accomplishment and pride in doing a difficult task. And lastly, we have

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.610
autonomy, and this is whether you believe you are free to determine much of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.210
what you do, and how you do it. So intrinsic motivation comes from within the

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.320
person. And we have four ways in which we discuss this.
