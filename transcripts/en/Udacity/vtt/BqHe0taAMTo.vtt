00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:05.432
2 times 3 is just 6 and then we're multiplying that by 10 to the negative 1

00:00:05.432 --> 00:00:10.540
power. Now I know that a negative 1 belongs here because we multiply terms that

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.342
have the same bases, we just need to add the exponents. Negative 4 plus 3 is

00:00:15.342 --> 00:00:20.630
negative 1. This gives us that same answer of 0.6 that we had before.
