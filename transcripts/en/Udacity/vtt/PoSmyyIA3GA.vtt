00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.450
So now we're going to talk about exceptions in out of order execution. Which,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.720
as we said, is part of what's wrong with Tomasulo's algorithm as far as

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.220
modern processors are concerned. Let's look at these four instructions and

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.700
how they execute. This first instruction is going to issue in the first cycle.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.510
And let's say we just are able to issue everything like this. This instruction

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.390
will dispatch in the second cycle, let us say it takes 40 cycles for

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.450
a divide to finish. So it is going to write the result in cycle 42.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.770
Meanwhile, this load could be dispatched in cycle three and maybe finish in,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.090
let's say cycle 15. And then, this instruction is waiting for the result of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.980
the load. So it will really dispatch in, let's say, cycle 14, and maybe be done,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.820
let's say, in cycle 19. And then, this subtract is waiting for F2 and F6, so

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.520
it can also be dispatched in cycle 14. And maybe finish in cycle 15.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.200
Let's say that F6 is 0, so we get a divide by 0 order. And

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.430
let's say that is detected in cycle 40. Some are towards the end of the divide.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.790
Let's say we ignore that. We have a divide by 0. So what should happen in

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.614
this processor is the program counter for this instruction should be saved.

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:15.520
We should jump to an exception handler. And then, if there is,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.130
exception handler comes back, we should be back to this instruction, and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.170
kind of start executing from here. However, what really happens is,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.090
in cycle 40, we have already executed these instructions and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.700
written the results. This is the only one that really hasn't been done.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.140
So F10 hasn't been undated. If we now go to the exception handler and then

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.430
come back. This instruction will use the F0 produced by this instruction. So

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.260
this instruction can now never get a correct result anymore even if we fix F6.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.840
For example, you could put something like a very small value here.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.070
Just to avoid a divide by 0 error. This can also happen for

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.860
example if a load has a page fault. We page the page back from the disk,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.640
go back to executing the load. But by that time,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.360
instructions after the load might have executed and there is no way to proceed.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.038
So this problem of having exceptions precisely. Is what is considered

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:15.850
to be the major drawback of Tomasulo's algorithm as it was implemented
