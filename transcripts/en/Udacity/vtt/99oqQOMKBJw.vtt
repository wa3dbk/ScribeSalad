00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is the second one.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here we're using conditional probability.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The event that we saw was the cipher text.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That's the encryption of m.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What we want to know whether the message is equal to m&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Both of those are drawn from the set of all possible messages.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In order for the attacker to know nothing is the same as the probability that the message is m

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
without knowing the cipher text.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The first answer would be correct if, a priori, the attacker knew nothing about the messages.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
All the attacker knows is each message is equally likely.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In that case, the probability that the message is m

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
would be 1 over the number of possible messages not depending on the cipher text.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The problem is the attacker might know something more.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They might know that some messages are more likely than others.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In most realistic scenarios this is the case.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The attacker knows that the message is likely to be a valid sentence in English.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Very few possible bit sequences correspond to that, so all messages are not equally likely.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That's why choice 1 is not the definition we want.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We want choice 2 where whatever the attacker already knew about

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the probability of the message as m is not affected in any way by seeing the cipher text.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That's our definition of a perfect cipher.

00:01:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now the question is can we prove that the one-time pad has this property.
