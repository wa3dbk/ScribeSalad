00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This first one looks very promising.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Grace is a word. Grace is the word?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Grease is the word.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Hopper is a word, and 1906 could match a number.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This looks very good.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Here grace is a word, some white space,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
hopper is a word, some white space, 1 is a number,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but because there's white space between the 1 and the 9,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
this is going to register as 4 different numbers instead of just one,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so it doesn't match this specification exactly.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Here we have grace followed by hopper in quotes,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and as we've defined things previously,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
this actually does qualify as a word.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's go back and see why.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Remember that our definition for word was anything that's not a space,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
a left angle bracket or a right angle bracket, and the double quote

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
certainly fits in there, so it may not be what we want right now,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but if you are sharp and notice that this qualifies as a word

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
under our rules, good eye.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And then 1906 is a number.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Here we have grace is the word, hopper is a word,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
one nine oh six is a word, so this is 3 words rather than 2 words and a number.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And grace hopper is of particular significance to programming language and compiler people

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
because she's the origin of the word "bug," meaning mistake in program.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
She is credited with finding the first computer bug, a moth

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that had worked its way into the machinery and removing it

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and recording it or what-not and thus repairing the problem.
