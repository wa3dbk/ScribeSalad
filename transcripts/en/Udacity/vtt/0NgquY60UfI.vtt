00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.828
So I searched for AVAudioUnitTimePitch example, and

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:07.600
I came across a stack overflow page that was promising.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.990
By the way, a link to this website is also available in the instructor notes.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.500
This page pointed me to some code, and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.390
also highlighted a video on a website called.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.900
WWDC.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.350
Now, WWDC, or

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.180
World Wide Developer Conference in an annual event Apple hosts in California,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.110
where Apple engineers showcase new technologies to software developers.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.830
One video in this website was particularly helpful.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.720
It's called AVAudioEngine in Practice.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.100
I looked through this video and

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.120
discovered a new way of working with sound in iOS 8.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.600
A link to this video is also available in the instructor notes, and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.640
I recommend that you bookmark it now, and watch it later.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.790
By the way, you will need the Safari browser to play this video.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.540
This video and

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.730
the previous [INAUDIBLE] page led me to some code, and here is that code.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.930
Now, before I run this, I want you to read through this, and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.140
see if you can translate this code into simple English.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.830
By the way, this is the sort of activity that expert software engineers will do

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.180
on a daily basis.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.140
See if you can make reasonable guesses about what's going on here, and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.350
then you can submit your answer in this box.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.270
You can refer to the lines in this code by the line numbers that

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.000
are provided here.
