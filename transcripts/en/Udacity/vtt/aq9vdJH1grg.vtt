00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.959
The purpose of this segment is to talk about scope which is a concept that we've been

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.370
using in the course but haven't actually talked about specifically

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.939
And so if you've been getting confused by decorators which decorate decorators

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:14.659
or functions, calling functions, return functions, and so on, this video is for you.

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.699
So when we talk about a variable scope,

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.869
we're talking about the region in the program in which we can access that variable.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.619
This is a concept that can go from being very simple to quite difficult.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.570
So let's start with something basic and build from there.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.728
Here we've got some very simple code, x=2, y=3, print the sum and of course, we get 5.

00:00:31.728 --> 00:00:34.689
In this example, x and y are what's called global variables

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:38.669
and then later what we call the global environment which I'm going to represent with this box

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:43.390
and in this environment, x is bound to the value 2 and y is bound to the value 3.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.660
The global environment is also where all our primitive operators are bound.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.090
So for example the plus sign is bound to some object which carries out addition

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.649
and we won't go into too much detail about what's going on there.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.679
So let's make things a bit more interesting--so here I've just defined a function called add_nums

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.679
and it returns x+y and when I run it, I get 11.

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.789
So what's happened here is that our function has created a new scope

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:11.669
and this scope is local to the function and so what happened when we defined add_nums

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:15.078
was we made this binding between this name and the function object.

00:01:15.078 --> 00:01:19.687
Now that's fine but as soon as we call add_nums by saying

00:01:19.687 --> 00:01:23.686
print the result print add_nums, we created a new environment

00:01:23.686 --> 00:01:27.770
Now I'm going to call this environment add_nums, and in this environment, we made an assignment.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.410
There are two assignment from x to 5 and from y to 6

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.100
and when we call add_nums, Python prefers to choose variables within its local scope.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.699
If it can do that, it then moves up following this pointer

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:43.969
to what's called its enclosing environment since this add_nums environment

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.619
lives inside of this global environment and lives there.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.709
If after following all these paths up into the global environment, it still doesn't find

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:55.050
the variable it's looking for that's when we get an error-- specifically a name error.
