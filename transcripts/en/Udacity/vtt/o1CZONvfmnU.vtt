00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.580
Welcome to the second lesson of Introduction to Data

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.630
Science. In the first lesson, we discussed data science at

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.730
a high level. So we talked about the skills that

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.590
a data scientist usually has, and also some of the

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.960
problems that you can solve using data science. One

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.340
of the most important skills that a data scientist can

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.050
have, is the ability to extract and clean data. This

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.190
is usually referred to as data wrangling or data munching.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.430
Believe it or not, some data scientists say that they

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.410
can spend up to 70% of their time data wrangling. This

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.070
may sound crazy to you, but it's not hard to imagine

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.530
this happening. Let's say you have some really cool analysis project

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.680
that you want to do. Say, look at a variety of

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.630
factors, and figure out why the life expectancy in City A

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.220
is higher than City B. Well okay, let's say that all

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.260
this data lives on a website. So, you write some scripts

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.920
to go and pull this data from the website. Great, but

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.935
then you need somewhere to store the data, so you're going

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:00.840
to need a database. So okay, we, we use a database,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.180
we store all the data there. And then you look at

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.209
the data and you realize, oh wait, there are a bunch

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.220
of missing values, or a bunch of this data looks weird.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.540
So you need to develop some, some method to take all

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.300
this data and clean it up. This is data munching. And all

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.770
of this is necessary if we want to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.090
answer our original really cool question. Why is the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.010
life expectancy in city A, higher than the life

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.940
expectancy in city B? In this lesson, we'll discuss

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.240
data munching basics using 3 data sets. One

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.550
containing information on a bunch of baseball players, called

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.172
the Lawmen baseball database. Another containing information on enrollments

00:01:37.172 --> 00:01:40.396
in an Indian identification program called Aadhar, and also

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:44.480
data from the last FM API. Using these 3 data sets, we're going

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.080
to discuss the formats that data can come in, how you can acquire data

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.170
from these various data sources, and also how to inspects the data and see

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.920
if it might have any missing or

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.020
erroneous values. Alright, well let's get started.
