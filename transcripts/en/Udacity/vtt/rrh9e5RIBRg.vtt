00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.206
In all the long division problems we've done so far, we've gotten really nice

00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:07.100
clean answers. Because we have gotten answers that don't have a remainder.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.432
We've gotten a zero when we complete our final subtraction step down here. Now,

00:00:11.432 --> 00:00:15.160
the reason this happened for every division we've done so far is that, each of

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.544
the things we've divided our original polynomials by, have been factors of

00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:23.724
those first polynomials. When we divide by a factor, there's nothing left over

00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:27.850
from the original expression that this doesn't go into. Well, what happens if

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.444
we divide by something that isn't a factor? Well, then we get some number down

00:00:31.444 --> 00:00:35.920
here instead of zero. Whatever number we get down here is, as I said before,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.612
called the remainder. But if the remainder isn't equal to zero, we have some

00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:43.243
more stuff to think about. Let's see what happens. Earlier on, we were working

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:49.406
with the function f of x equals x cubed minus 4 x squared plus x plus 6. Now,

00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:53.374
when we were looking for roots, or zeroes, we tried to see what happens when we

00:00:53.374 --> 00:00:59.365
let x equal 1. We found out that plugging that in gave us 4. Since when we plug

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:04.232
this in we don't get 0, we know that 1 is not a 0 of this polynomial. And that

00:01:04.232 --> 00:01:09.158
means, in turn, that x minus 1 is not a factor. I wonder what would happen

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:13.132
then, if we divide this polynomial by x minus 1? Let's find out. Here I've

00:01:13.132 --> 00:01:15.797
written out all the different boxes you're going to need to fill in to complete

00:01:15.797 --> 00:01:19.751
this long division. So please, write what belongs in each one, and then write

00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:24.358
your final answer up here. Please note that I've put subtraction signs and then

00:01:24.358 --> 00:01:28.448
parentheses around boxes. So make sure that you write the expression that

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:32.460
belongs inside here, given that the subtraction sign is outside. Also, don't

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.303
forget to bring down your x and your 6 from the original expression.
