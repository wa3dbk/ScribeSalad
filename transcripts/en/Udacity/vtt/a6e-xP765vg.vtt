00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.828
Hello, and welcome to Lesson 4. In Lesson 4, you will be working with numbers

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:08.722
and with strings. You already know that you use integers for whole numbers and

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:14.410
the type called double for numbers that can have fractional parts. So far, that

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.766
seems pretty easy, but there's some things that you need to know so that you

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:21.004
stay out of trouble. Let me give you an example. Have a look at this statement

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:26.670
over here. We initialize the variable one million with well, one million. We

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.190
multiply one million by itself, that gives us one trillion, which is a number

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.307
with a lot of zeroes. And we put this into mystery, now you can already tell

00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:38.112
that something is going to go wrong. Otherwise, I wouldn't have name this

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:42.980
variable a mystery. So go ahead, fire up BlueJ and type these statements into

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.083
the code pad. Or if you prefer, use the Udacity ID. When you're done, tell me

00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:49.700
what you got for mystery.
