00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.870
Here, I have 2 point, 3,2 and 7,10. Now, I've drawn a line between them and I'd

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:09.307
like you to tell me just like you have before, what the slope of this line

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:14.077
segment is. Try calculating this, first, using the coordinates of the top point,

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.557
7,10, as the one that comes first in our equation for slope, and then try

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:23.305
calculating a second way using these coordinates as the ones that come first in

00:00:23.317 --> 00:00:25.408
the denominator and in the numerator.
