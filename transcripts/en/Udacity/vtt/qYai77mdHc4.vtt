00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.800
Now we've done a lot of work. We've learned how to identify the instance

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.620
variables of a class, how to provide the methods, how to write the constructors

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.480
and the result has been a lot of code. But we've forgotten something very, very

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.490
important. How does one use this code and who's one? That would be the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.050
programmer who doesn't want to know what goes on inside the car class but who

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.110
just wants to write programs that drive cars around. Now, for a car, when we

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.780
have an owner's manual but for code, what you want is Javadoc. Let me show you

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.170
what one needs to put into the code to get the javadoc. Over here you see the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.887
same car class that we've been developing. But I've added documentation

00:00:39.887 --> 00:00:45.510
comments. These comments are enclosed in these delimiters. You see them over

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.380
here. You see another set of over here. And at the top of the class, you see a

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.560
class comment that describes the purpose of the class. At the top of every

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.480
constructor and of every method, you see a method comment. For every parameter

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.970
there is a line explaining what the parameter means. And for those methods that

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.920
return a value, there is a comment that explains what the method returns. Now,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.430
previously, you have seen the javadoc comments in a webpage, the way to get

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.520
such a webpage for your own classes is to run the javadoc tool, which we can

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.630
easily do from within BlueJ. In the main BlueJ menu, pick tools, then project

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.250
documentation and you'll get to see a webpage in the familiar javadoc format

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.540
that contains exactly the same comments. They were in the source file that's

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.320
what javadoc tool does. It takes the comments from the source file and puts

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.910
them into the web page. For example, here you see the description of a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.700
parameter and that's the exact same description that was provided in the source

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.352
code. Notice that over here this method looks rather naked, no description, no

00:01:49.352 --> 00:01:54.750
parameter description, oh, that's because there is no java.com in here. So it's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.610
your turn now. Go ahead and put it in.
