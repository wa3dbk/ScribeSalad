00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.469
So let's talk about divided attention.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:03.730
&gt;&gt; You know, I'm going to tell you a little story

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.830
about dorm room Debbie from lesson two. And we're going to

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.630
talk about how we create a great experience to not

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.600
violate the constraint of our users having a divided attention. So

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.840
imagine we have dorm room Debbie, she's late for class.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.130
With a latte in one hand, her smart phone in

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.530
the other hand, and carrying a lot of books. On

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.330
her way to class she has to cross several busy streets,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.300
so her attention is very split between all these things. Then she gets

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.610
a notification on her Android smart phone. It's from her library app, telling

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.180
her she has a book overdue. So imagine you made this library app

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.760
for Debbie. How would you notify her that her library books are overdue?
