Over the course this lesson, we discover a super powerful tool because of

00:00:04.297 --> 00:00:08.793
Grant's airplane situation. We can now find the distance between any two points

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:13.087
on a graph. And, I don't just mean points that we can count squares on graph

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.290
paper to find the distance between. I mean, any two points on a coordinate

00:00:17.302 --> 00:00:22.015
plane. Think about how you used triangles, right triangles in particular, to

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:25.640
find the distance from Grant's hometown to the city Udacity. Can you do

00:00:25.652 --> 00:00:29.950
something similar to find the distances between these points on this graph? To

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:34.170
make your life easier, I only want you to find the distance from A to B, from B

00:00:34.182 --> 00:00:38.800
to C, from C to D and from D to A. Please write your answers in exact form. In

00:00:38.812 --> 00:00:43.441
other words, I don't want you to round. Instead, I would like you to write them

00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:48.075
in whatever form you need to write them to represent the actual exact number

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.859
that each length is equal to. To help you do this, I'd like to remind you that

00:00:52.871 --> 00:00:58.123
if you want to enter a square root sign, using MathQuill, you need to type the

00:00:58.135 --> 00:01:05.495
keys back \sqrt, and then the space bar. Then, you can use your arrow keys to

00:01:05.507 --> 00:01:07.656
move your cursor around.
