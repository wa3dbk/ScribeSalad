00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.620
And the answer, at least at the time of writing, is 16.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.700
And if it's actually different from 16,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.520
we'll have our grading script update accordingly.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.517
Let me show you how I arrived to this answer.

00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:13.205
All right. So here we are in Python I first import the libraries I need.

00:00:13.205 --> 00:00:16.320
URL of two and Mini dom.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.340
Okay and then I download the New York Times page.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.070
I'm going to use URL lib to URL open and I'm pasting the URL.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.540
I'm going to go ahead and call read on that to download the contents and

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.510
we're going to store that under a variable called contents.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.330
We can take a peek at contents.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.970
There we go.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.000
A lot of stuff and looks like RSS.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.650
We can see the closing RSS tag there.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.970
Now we're going to parse this with Mini Dom.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.410
Okay. That worked, got a variable d, it's got a document instance, and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.180
I'm going to use get elements by tag name, item, to find all of those.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.780
So let's give this a whirl.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.730
Success.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.480
And then we just run length on this.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.350
Okay and the answer's 18 [LAUGH].

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.440
So grading this is actually going to be a little tricky for

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.920
us, all we wanted you to do is go through this process.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.170
So hopefully, that worked out for you and you got a number.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.080
And hopefully, we managed to grade that number.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.810
That's how you parse some basic XML, I think you can see probably, the value

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.505
here and that many webpages have XML, interfaces them, or RSS interfaces them.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.260
Where you can actually download their content, and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.490
manipulate it, from a program.
