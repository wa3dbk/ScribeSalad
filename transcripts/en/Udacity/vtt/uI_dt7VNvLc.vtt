00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.050
This Critical Rendering Path was not nearly as daunting

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.800
as I was afraid it was at first. Now

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.170
that we've gone through it end to end, I'm

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.280
feeling really great. It's definitely not magic. what's next?

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.160
&gt;&gt; Well, now we get into the fun stuff, the optimizations.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.920
And there's a lot to say here, but you know what, now

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.870
that you know, the Critical Rendering Path and how it works,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.430
I think a lot of the piece speed optimization will be obvious.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.910
&gt;&gt; Great, I am really excited to get started optimizing my portfolio page.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.650
See you next lesson.
