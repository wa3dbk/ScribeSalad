00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.337
The greatest common factor for these two numbers would be 24. Excellent work if

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:10.096
you got this one correct. If we expand the prime factors of 216 and the prime

00:00:10.096 --> 00:00:14.727
factors of 192, we can see that they share three, two's and one, three. The

00:00:14.727 --> 00:00:19.847
greatest common factor is the product of the lowest power of each factor that

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:24.750
appears in each term. So two to the third is the lowest power of the basic two

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.732
that appears in both terms. And three to the one is also the lowest power that

00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:34.449
appears for the base of three in each term. We want to simplify our result so

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.203
two cubed is eight and eight times three is 24.
