We need to replace x with x minus 2 if we want to shift this parabola to the

00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:09.548
right by 2. In the y direction we saw that moving in the negative direction in

00:00:09.548 --> 00:00:14.069
y, required adding to y. And moving in the positive direction required

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.765
subtracting from y. The same is true of x.
