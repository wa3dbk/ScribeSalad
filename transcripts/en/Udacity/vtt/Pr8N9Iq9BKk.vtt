00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.460
When I started learning how to code,
I use the concept of learning zones

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.300
to help me map out my new
journey as a new programmer.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.750
I always reflected on
the skills I was learning and

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.100
tracked whether I was in my safe zone,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.530
where concepts are familiar and
where we don't need to take any risks.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.630
Stretch zone where we're
introduced to new concepts, and

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.220
we're making new discoveries.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.920
Or STRAIN zone,
where learning becomes difficult and

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.680
is often blocked by
sense of frustration.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.500
The border between the STRETCH and

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.970
the STRAIN zone is the point
of maximum learning.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.510
Our goal is to keep you between your
STRETCH and your STRAIN zone, so

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.150
you are always learning.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.390
Whenever you learn something new you
may feel like your learning zones

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.070
are fluctuating.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.650
One moment you could be
in your safe zone and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.075
the next minute you're
in your strain zone.

00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:50.020
This should be totally expected.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.260
Learning something new especially
programming can be a winding journey

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.030
with many highs and lows.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.970
Let's read a little bit more
about your learning zones.
