00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.816
This class has three instance variables. The number of seats, the driver name,

00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:07.891
and the list of passengers. For which are these should we have getters and

00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:11.786
setters. The number of seats certainly shouldn't have a setter. You can't

00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:16.373
really change the number of seats in a car. Should it have a getter? if you

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:20.478
added one, it's not a mistake. but there's probably no grade reason for having

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:25.717
it. I didn't add one. Now, the driver name definitely needs a setter, because,

00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:32.591
when you look through the methods, there is no way of setting it otherwise. So,

00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:38.830
let's add a setter. Here is my setter. Do I need a getter? I think I do.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.958
There's no other way of finding out who's driving this car. None of the other

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.410
methods make any use of the driver name. I'm assuming it was important since

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.548
someone added the instance variable. So, let's add the getter as well. Here is

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:57.340
my getter. And as is so often, the setter and the getter have very simple

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.914
implementation. What about the third instance variable? You definitely don't

00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:10.122
want to have getters and setters for this variable. It would be very odd to

00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:17.668
have a method that holds and places an internal array of the class. And you

00:01:17.668 --> 00:01:21.113
also wouldn't really want to return it, because then you would give the user of

00:01:21.113 --> 00:01:26.988
the class the possibility of changing its content. So there is a rule of thumb

00:01:26.988 --> 00:01:31.204
that says that in general, a class that does not want to return any internal

00:01:31.204 --> 00:01:37.755
parts of its implementation that a third party could modify. Now, you've seen a

00:01:37.755 --> 00:01:41.118
bunch of useful patterns that hopefully will help you designing the

00:01:41.118 --> 00:01:47.330
implementation of a class. I will put those to good use when we implement our

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.117
car share application. But before we do that, there is another technical topic

00:01:52.117 --> 00:01:56.450
that we need to tackle. Namely, variables and methods that don't belong to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.050
objects, but to the class as a whole.
