00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.830
Adding support for the location insert
looks almost identical

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.826
to adding support for weather.

00:00:05.826 --> 00:00:07.842
We just have to
select the right table name

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:10.430
and return the right location URI.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.820
But there's one more thing to do.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.250
All we have to do is call

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.200
getContext().getContentResolver
().notifyChange

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.130
on the URI that was actually
passed into our function,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.670
to notify any observers
that need to know

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.050
that URI has changed.
And that's it.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.640
We've now finished insert.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.510
However, of course, we're never done
without also adding a test.
