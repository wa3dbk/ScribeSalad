00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So we're very close to saying something about the approximation quality

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of the Take 2 algorithm, because we now know 2 things about this loop here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
First of all each time this loop here is run, it puts at least 1 vertex

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
from an optimum solution into its solution set. And the second thing that we know

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is that this loop here runs at most K times, where K is the size

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of a minimum vertex cover. Now my question to you is, after this algorithm

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
here is done, how many vertices has it put into its solution set?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Has it chosen at most K vertices, at most 2K vertices, at least K vertices,

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
at least 2K vertices, or on average 2K vertices? Please select all that are correct.
