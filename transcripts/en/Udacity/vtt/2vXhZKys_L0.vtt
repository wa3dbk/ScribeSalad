00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.093
Now you've seen that mathematicians like to name functions simple things, like

00:00:04.093 --> 00:00:08.048
the letter f. And we've also seen that the input of a function is some sort of

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:12.224
independent variable, and we've seen that x can be that variable. But we don't

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:16.378
have to use these names, f and x, for these functions and independent variables.

00:00:16.378 --> 00:00:20.672
We can actually use pretty much anything we want to use. Remember, variables are

00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:24.702
just placeholders for things that have different meanings in different real

00:00:24.702 --> 00:00:28.809
world situations. What if instead of f of x, we have g of u? In this case, what

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.844
is the name of the function? And what is the independent variable that's being

00:00:32.844 --> 00:00:34.010
used in that function?
