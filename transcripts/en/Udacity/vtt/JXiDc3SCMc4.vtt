00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.969
Now that we formally recognize that this is a quadratic equation, it would be

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.810
really great if we could get it in the form x minus a times x minus b, so

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.470
we could easily see what values of x satisfy this equation. This is going to

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.085
be way easier to solve if we have two linear factors multiplied together.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:21.880
Than if we have to deal with this messy squared term right here. So,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.300
let's take a second and just look at this product for a moment. Now, actually to

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.510
make your life a little bit easier, I changed those minus signs to plus signs.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.710
So we now have the expression x plus a, times x plus b. Now,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.260
as a starting point for working with this expression x plus a times x plus b.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.920
I'd like you to try distributing the multiplication here out, and

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.180
writing the answer that you get as a polynomial in standard form.
