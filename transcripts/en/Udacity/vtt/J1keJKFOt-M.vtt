00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.116
For this problem x equals positive 12. Great effort for getting this one

00:00:05.116 --> 00:00:09.571
correct. I hope you're on a roll with these. We start solving by isolating this

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:13.847
cube root on one side of the equal sign. This means we'll have to subtract 5

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:18.858
from both sides, in order to isolate this cubed root. To undo this cube root,

00:00:18.858 --> 00:00:24.390
we raise both sides to the third power. The cube of the cube root x minus 4, is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.782
just x minus 4 and the cube of 2 equals 8. Now we're ready to solve for x and

00:00:29.782 --> 00:00:33.086
we just add 4 to both sides to get x equals 12 and as always, we want to make

00:00:33.086 --> 00:00:37.888
sure to check. We take the value of 12 and plug it in for x into the original

00:00:37.888 --> 00:00:42.550
equation. This cube root simplifies to the cube root of 8, which equals

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.590
positive 2. 2 plus 5 equals 7. So yes, our solution checks.
