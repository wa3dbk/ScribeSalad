To transform negative y equals the root of x, so that y is by itself on the

00:00:03.318 --> 00:00:08.440
left hand side, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by negative one.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.758
Then we end up with this, y equals negative square root x. So, just like we saw

00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:17.586
before with polynomials, negating the entire function, or in other words, the

00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:22.940
entire expression involving x flips the graph upside down. Or in other words,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.719
reflects it in the x axis.
