00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.420
So to give a response then, you'd actually just swap the

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.760
source and destination ports, and the source and destination IP addresses.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.112
The path back will feel just like the path forward, though

00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:14.000
it's possible that it will follow a different set of hops.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.329
And of course it will be in the reverse. When the

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.660
packet gets back, to the mo, router at your house, it

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.380
will swap out the IP and port for the correct ones

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.760
as part of the network address translation. It's routing table will

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.210
then tell it the MAC address of your computer, so that

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.810
it can be put in a packet in a link layer frame

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.800
and passed back to your computer. Now, to complete the handshake,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.220
and establish the TCP connection, your computer needs to send back an

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.670
acknowledgement to Udacity. This will be almost exactly the same as

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.200
the first packet with just a small change to the TCP header.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.320
Indeed all the communication will feel much like this, only instead

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.950
of sending packets with no contents, Udacity will send each other real

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.360
data, with the TCP headers, IP headers, and then sometimes on and

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.180
off during the transmission, the link layer headers and footers as well.
