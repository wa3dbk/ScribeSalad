00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.418
Most of us know the story of the Shepard boy that cried wolf.

00:00:04.418 --> 00:00:08.010
The moral is that, of building trust.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.311
Model building is no different.

00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:14.692
For any model to be useful, it needs to be verifiable.

00:00:14.692 --> 00:00:19.089
In fact, we have already looked through several examples,

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.830
where we have iterated through the questioning, modeling, and

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.290
verification steps, to build robust models.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.650
In this lesson, we will take a closer look at what it means to verify a model,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.019
and how you, the model builder, can go about doing so.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.830
We will go through several examples, of how to make a classification model and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.970
validate it.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.130
We will touch upon, how we will obtain the best performance from a model and

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.500
define, what are the measures of performance.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.340
We will also introduce to you, the quantitative tools to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.260
compare different models and how to choose between them.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.930
To illustrate this, we will use location data collected by AT&amp;T's connected cars

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.330
and try to identify these cars based on the driving patterns over time.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.860
So, let's get started
