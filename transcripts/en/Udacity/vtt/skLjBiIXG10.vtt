00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.546
So, according the commutative property, we
can rearrange everything that we had

00:00:04.558 --> 00:00:08.978
multiplied together in this term in
whatever order we want, as long as we keep

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.561
every number we started with, or every
factor that we started with. And, we still

00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:18.031
just multiply those number together. So,
first I'm going to check and make sure

00:00:18.043 --> 00:00:23.049
that every answer choice has a 10, an m, a
23 and the 7 in it. And it turns out that

00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:27.946
this answer does it, so I'll put an x next
to that. We will not be check, checking

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:32.189
this box off. We know that we're only
allowed to multiply these factors

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:37.144
together, so any answer I see that has an
operator besides a multiplication sign in

00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:42.544
it can't be right. So here, we have some
addition. So, This answer isn't right, or

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:47.543
this one, or this one. Now, there are two
tricky things in here. There are

00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:52.807
parenthesis in this answer and in this
answer. Remember, that another way to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:58.149
indicate multiplication is just to write
factors next to one another, all in

00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:03.085
parentheses. We can do this instead of
writing the dots for multiplication. So,

00:01:03.097 --> 00:01:07.880
in fact, checking these two answers that
have the parenthesis in them, knowing now

00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:12.585
that parenthesis mean multiplication, we
see that they are both in fact correct.

00:01:12.687 --> 00:01:17.836
Looking at our four remaining choices, all
of these are also right answers. In fact,

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:22.526
there are a number of other right answers
that I just didn't chose to write down

00:01:22.538 --> 00:01:27.373
here. Any order that we create these four
factors in as long as use to multiply them

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:29.251
together will still be equal to this term.
