00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.429
Let's look at one last example comparing car companies. Here's my coordinate

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:08.773
grid. X is the number of hours or the time of the car rental, and y is the cost

00:00:08.773 --> 00:00:13.226
in dollars. This company, Numerator Cars, has already been graphed for you.

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:17.637
We're going to compare Numerator Cars to Carz-to-Go. Carz-to-go charges $5 per

00:00:17.637 --> 00:00:22.748
hour, and a $10 registration fee. So what equation could you write to represent

00:00:22.748 --> 00:00:27.347
the cost of a car rental from Cars to Go. Write that equation in this box.
