00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.170
For this quadratic, we want to find factors of 1 times negative 4 that sum to 3.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.560
Negative 1 and 4, multiply, to give us negative 4 and sum to give us 3. Since

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.342
the coefficient on the square term is just 1, I can use these factors for my

00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:18.930
factored form. Remember that this would not be the case if this was not a 1.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.737
We'd have to use factoring by grouping. Then, we use our 0 product property to

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:28.060
set each factor equal to 0. Adding one to both sides, we get p is equal to 1.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.590
And subtracting four from both sides, we could get p is equal to negative 4.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.673
Great work if you got this solution set.
