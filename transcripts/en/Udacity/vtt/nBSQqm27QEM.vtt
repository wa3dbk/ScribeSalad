00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.010
A plus 3 times a plus 5 is correct, great work if you figured that one out. We

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.820
can start by factoring the two numerators. The factors of negative 5 that sum to

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.520
4 are positive 5 and negative 1. For the second numerator we want to find

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.345
factors of 15 that sum to 8, those are positive 5 and positive 3. We know we're

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:23.030
going to multiply these two fractions together, so we'll multiply every factor

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.180
in the numerator and every factor in the denominator. We can think of this

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.975
denominator as 1 times the quantity a plus 5. The same is true for this one, 1

00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:35.648
times a minus 1. I show this so that way we can understand we 're really

00:00:35.648 --> 00:00:39.756
multiplying these two factors together. This is why I use the parentheses around

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:44.695
these two expressions. We know a plus 5 divided by a plus 5 equals 1 and a minus

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:50.122
1 divided by a minus 1 also equals 1. This leaves us with a plus 5 times a plus

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:55.460
3 in the numerator divided by 1 in the denominator. Anything divided by 1 is

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.993
itself so this is our answer.
