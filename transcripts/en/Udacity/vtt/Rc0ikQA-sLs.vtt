Now that we know that Grant's airplane map contains a right triangle, let's

00:00:04.205 --> 00:00:08.483
think more about right triangles in general. I've done three different right

00:00:08.495 --> 00:00:12.848
triangles for you right here. And below each one, I've written one equation or

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:17.274
in these two cases two equations that relate the lengths of their sides to each

00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:21.628
other. For each triangle, I've labeled a as the shortest side, b as the second

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.945
shortest side, and c as the longest side link. Which equation or set of

00:00:25.957 --> 00:00:30.213
equations down here will hold true for all right triangles?
