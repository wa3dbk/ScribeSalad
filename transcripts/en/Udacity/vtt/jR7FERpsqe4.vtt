00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is a pretty tricky question, which I'm going to answer in two phases.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's just look at the 0.5 over here, 0.8 of that, which is 0.4, ends up over here,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and 0.1 of this, which is 0.05 ends up over here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The reason why I write it so small is because this is not the correct answer quite yet.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's look at the other 0.5.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
0.4 goes two steps--1, 2--and ends up over here on the left side,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but 0.1 falls short and makes the 0.05 over here 0.05 in the second grid cell.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And interestingly enough, for the cell on the right side,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
there's two possibly ways you could've gotten there.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Either by overshooting starting in the second cell,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
or undershooting starting in the right cell.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So the total is the sum of these two things--0.1.

00:00:56.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is the final answer: 0.4, 0.05, 0.05, 0.4, and 0.1.
