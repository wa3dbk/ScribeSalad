00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.569
This is how it works, right.

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:03.779
So I've got my one image and
my other image,

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.550
which is why they're called image 1 and
image 2, all right.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.710
And, the first thing we're going to do
is we're going to build what are called

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.910
Gaussian pyramids, all right.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.780
And that's illustrated like this.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.535
So it's Gaussian pyramid of image one.

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:20.040
Well we'll talk more extensively in
a minute about how you might go about

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.530
building those pyramids.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.000
This is just mostly so
you understand what is going on.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.260
So now I have these reduced
pyramids at the top level.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.990
Remember I have that very blurry picture
that actually only has a small number of

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.820
pixels in it and the motion between
them is actually much smaller.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.410
And that's shown here, right?

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.020
So here, it says our u is ten.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.190
So that's saying,

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.180
let's suppose the shift is ten pixels,
at the lowest level.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.920
Well when I cut it in half,
it becomes five.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.460
Then it becomes two and a half.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.420
Then it becomes one and a quarter.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.370
I can keep going.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.350
So this is how I reduce the amount
of motion that's present.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.040
So because I've reduced
the amount of motion,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.760
I can first run Lukas-Kanade
between those coarsest level.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.110
And I might do the iterative thing,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.550
that's the thing we looked at
last time where I set a plane,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.890
estimate it, shift it a little bit,
estimate it, shift it a little bit.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.040
Keep doing til i, til I converge.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.830
So that will map the motion between
the very reduced image 1 and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.130
the very reduced image 2.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.940
Right, so I can, I can compare that.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.110
I can find the motion between them.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.030
The question then is, what do I do next?

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.990
Well what I have to do is,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.760
I have to go from the coarser
to the next finer level, okay?

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.540
And what's written here is warp and
upsample, all right?

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.820
We're going to go through the details
of that, but basically the way you can

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.440
think about this is,
I compared something at a coarse level.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.870
Then I know, okay,
if I were to double up this image and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.270
double up that image, I would have
to double up the motion field.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.550
I would also have to double the,
the, the amount I'm moving.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.930
We'll do that algorithm in a minute.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.230
But I could apply that to the next
level and what that will do is,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.030
that will get me the next level
very close to the second image.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.190
At that level and I could run Lucas and
Kanade again, and then I can iterate and

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.870
run that over again and
eventually get the entire motion field.
