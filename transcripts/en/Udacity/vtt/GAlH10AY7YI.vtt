00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.723
Another possible way we might deal with that is to use hassattr. This is a test

00:00:04.723 --> 00:00:09.374
of whether an object has a particular attribute. Hassattr is a built in operator

00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:14.366
and has attribute a value of true of the object has an attribute with the given

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:18.911
name. As an example, if fussy is a DiscerningBear instance, if we ask if fussy

00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:23.366
has an attribute, knock<u>down</u>tree, we'll get true. But if we ask if it has a

00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:27.415
climb_tree attribute, we'll get false. That's because it's a grizzly bear, which

00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:32.094
doesn't have a climb_tree. Using has attribute, we could define bear chase like

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:36.605
this. Almost identical to what we did before with this instance. Except for now,

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:40.983
we're using hassattr instead of this instance. And instead of checking if it's a

00:00:40.983 --> 00:01:27.099
black bear or a grizzly bear, we're checking whether it has a climb_tree or a

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
knock<u>down</u>tree attribute.
