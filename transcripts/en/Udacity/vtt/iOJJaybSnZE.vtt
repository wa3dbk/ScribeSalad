00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.220
So here's a third useful fact,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.510
that I probably should have put
first now that I write it down.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.320
And that is the idea that, if we start
off with sum Q function, Q1, and we

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.460
run k steps of value iteration, in other
words we apply the Bellman operator k

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.510
times, that the k step Bellman
operator is a contraction mapping.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.750
And the index of contraction is like
gamma to the k which is a much,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.700
much smaller number.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.860
So running k steps of value iteration
actually pushes your value functions

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.060
much closer together than let's say,
a single step value iteration.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.748
Which is really what you'd expect.

00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:37.246
&gt;&gt; That is,
although that's even better, right,

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:39.843
because it's not just like linear.

00:00:39.843 --> 00:00:40.961
&gt;&gt; It's not like linear.

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:44.147
&gt;&gt; Right, it's like gamma squared,
gamma cubed, gamma to the third,

00:00:44.147 --> 00:00:45.100
gamma to the k.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.363
&gt;&gt; Right, and that is the index of
contraction so we run ten steps of value

00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:51.900
iteration, that's like running one
step of ten step value iteration.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.010
So again, it's not super surprising but
what's nice about it is

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.712
it gives us a way of quantifying
how long we run value iteration and

00:00:59.712 --> 00:01:03.720
connecting it with how close you are to
optimal after you've run that far.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.170
And so, this kind of fact is underlying
these other things that I wrote number

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.270
one and number two which is probably why
I should have set the third one first.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.560
&gt;&gt; That's okay, we can fix it in post.
