00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.532
To take The Brain That Changes Itself off the list, I first have to figure out

00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:08.716
what its index is. Originally, it was three. Zero, one, two, three, but then I

00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:13.658
added another one, before it, so now it's four. So I'll remove the item at

00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:18.635
index four. I think you're more familiar with basic ArrayList modifications

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:23.524
now. Let's go back to Kai to talk about, how to do computations that take the

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:26.664
entire ArrayList into account.
