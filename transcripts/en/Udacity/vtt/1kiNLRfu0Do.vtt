At this point let's go back to Oliver, and

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.520
hear what else he asks in an interview.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.217
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'd love to hear you talk more about UI view controller,

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:12.760
in particular the life cycle of a UI view controller.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.120
UI view controllers are used everywhere in iOS,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.540
and have many different use cases.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.820
so, to demonstrate, I built this super simple App.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.640
It has view controller A here, when I tap this button,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.570
I see view controller B, when I tap it again I go back to to view controller A.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.790
I looked at here you talk about the ordering of the events and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.250
the lifecycle, so in what order the methods are called, what methods are called,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.820
is it view did load, view will appear.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.901
And could you just expand on the lifecycle of a UI view controller?

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.140
&gt;&gt; This question is trickier than it first appears.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.480
I want you to think about this, use a pen and a paper to draw out your ideas,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.540
and then share your thoughts with us on the discussion forum.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.810
Here is the question one more time, submit your answers on the discussion forum,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.250
and comment on each other's responses.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.650
Check this box when you are done.
