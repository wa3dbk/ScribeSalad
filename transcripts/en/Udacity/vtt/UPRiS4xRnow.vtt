00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.630
So your t statistic is 2.45. And you also know that since the sample size is

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.870
24, the degrees of freedom is 23. So here's 23 degrees of freedom, and we'll

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:19.266
look for 2.45. Since that's the t statistic we got. That's in between 2.177 and

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:26.717
2.5. The area to the right of this t critical value, 2.177, is 0.02, or 2%. The

00:00:26.717 --> 00:00:31.180
area to the right of 2.5 is 0.01, 1%. So that means that the area to the right

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:40.128
of 2.45 is between 0.02 and 0.01. Not all t tables are the same. But as long as

00:00:40.128 --> 00:00:47.553
you understand how we got this, that's the important part.
