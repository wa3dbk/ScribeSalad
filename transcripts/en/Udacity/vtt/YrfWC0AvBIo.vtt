00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.822
Remember that we can easily see what the equation of a parabola might look like

00:00:04.822 --> 00:00:09.665
if we just think about what its x intercepts are. These are the points where y

00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:14.659
equals 0. So one of those factors needs to be the x minus 4, since that factor

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:19.522
as a whole will equal 0, when x equal 4. And the other needs to be x plus 2,

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:24.637
since that will be 0 when x equals negative 2, our other x intercept. So y

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:30.390
equals x minus 4 times the quantity x plus 2 must be the correct answer.
