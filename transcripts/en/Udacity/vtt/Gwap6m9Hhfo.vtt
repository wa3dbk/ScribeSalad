00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.740
This visualization packs a lot of information into

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.120
a small area. So, here are some of the

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.240
details that are communicated. We know the size of

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.230
Napoleon's army. We know the location of the army

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.010
at various points in time. The color coding on

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.090
the march into and out of Moscow tells us

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.830
the direction of the army's movement. And we're also

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.410
shown the temperature on various dates during Napoleon's retreat.
