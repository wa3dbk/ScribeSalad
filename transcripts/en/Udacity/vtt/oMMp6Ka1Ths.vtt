00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.193
Negative 6 times negative 2 is positive 12. Negative 2 minus 4 makes negative 6.

00:00:05.194 --> 00:00:10.121
And, I know I have multiplication here, negative 4 times negative 6, because I

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:15.023
had multiplication up here, with this larger parentheses. 12 plus 8 makes 20,

00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:20.316
and negative 4 times negative 6 makes positive 24. And whoa, look at that. Our

00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:25.491
answers actually match. 20 does equal 20. So, we know x equals negative 2 was

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:26.810
definitely correct.
