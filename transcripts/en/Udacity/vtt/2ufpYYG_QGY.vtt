00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.070
Now we have looked at strategy selection a little bit, let us look at

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.000
strategy integration. Even if the agent selects a particular strategy,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.100
it is not necessarily stuck with that strategy. As the problem-solving evolves,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.740
it may well decide to shift from one strategy to another strategy.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.660
As an example, consider that for a given problem,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.430
metacognition decides to select the strategy of case-based reasoning.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.710
Now case-based reasoning spawns a number of sub-tasks. Retrieval, adaptation,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.100
evaluation, and storage. Metacognition can now examine the requirements for

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.520
each of the sub-tasks. And then, with each of the sub-tasks,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.770
it may decide on some strategy. For example, for the task of adaptation,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.450
metacognition may pick the method of case-based reasoning recursively. Or

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.090
it may pick the method of rules to adapt a case. Or it may use models for

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.390
the case adaptation. If metacognition picks the method of rule based reasoning,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.495
then note that metacognition has shifted from the method of

00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:56.571
case-based reasoning overall to the method of rule-based reasoning. For

00:00:56.571 --> 00:01:00.840
a sub-task of case-based reasoning. We can also use a similar analysis at

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.715
the next lower level. Suppose that metacognition decides to pick the method of

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:08.720
rule-based reasoning for doing the case adaptation. Now the question becomes,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.520
what rule to apply. Rule 1, 2, or 3. We can imagine meta-rules that select,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.500
which rule to apply in any given condition.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.300
We've come across a use of metacognition for strategy integration earlier.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.934
And this blocks microworld, we saw how means [INAUDIBLE] can reach a cul-de-sac.

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:31.340
When the cul-de-sac happens, metacognition may, set up a new reasoning goal and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.370
select a strategy of problem reduction for resolving the cul-de-sac. Problem

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.610
reduction then, sets up four independent goals. We made it work back to mean

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.150
internal assist to achieve each goal independently. In this particular case,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.050
we have integrated means and internal assistance and problem reduction and

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.420
the reasoning has shifted between these two strategies in a seamless way.
