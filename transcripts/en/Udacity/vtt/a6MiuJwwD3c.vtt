00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So let's write some Python code to solve this particular example.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So here's a translation of that problem and the solution into Python.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So first I have a list of the connections in that graph

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we were just looking at--nodes A through H.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And for each of these pairs, I go through and make a link in a Graph G.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Then I write a piece of code to list the component sizes

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
for that Graph G, and here's what the output looks like.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then we'll go back and look at what the algorithm is.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It goes through and identifies that there's two components.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
One we'll just name little A

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because it contains node little A; it has four nodes in it.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Then there's a separate component that's not connected to the first one

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that contains B, and that also has four nodes.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In fact, looking back at the graph here, that's exactly what we see.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
There's the purple nodes, which include node A,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and then there's these blue-green nodes

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
four of which are visible here that include B.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So it finds the right stuff. How does it go about doing this?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Well, it essentially uses the same algorithm that I did

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
when I was doing it by hand, but of course it does it in code.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The main routine that we call is called mark component.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So that's kind of like what I was doing when I was turning nodes purple,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and it works like this: we give it the graph that we're working on,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the current node that we're marking,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and data structure that keeps track of which things have been marked so far.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Call this routine on this node,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
That's a new node; we haven't seen it before, and so we mark it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So that means we've visited that node, and we say

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that in this particular call to the routine

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
so far we've marked exactly one node.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Then we look at all the neighbors of that node.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
For each of them, we say

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
if that neighbor of the node that we're looking at

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
hasn't been marked so far,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
then what we're going to do is recursively

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
call mark a component on that neighbor.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It's going to go and get everywhere that it can get to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that it hasn't already gotten to,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
mark them all, and return.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
What it returns is the number of nodes that it marked

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
as part of this process.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
However many nodes it marked,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
we're going to add that to the total number marked.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So we marked our current node, then we visited a neighbor

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and marked all the nodes connected to that neighbor,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
then we come back and repeat this loop

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
for all the different neighbors of the node where we started.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
When that's exhausted, it means we've now reached out

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and touched all the nodes that are touchable

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
from node node.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And so we return the total that were actually marked as part of this process

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and then it's done.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So that's the main routine that does all the hard work..

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
There's also a routine on the outside

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that takes a graph

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and starts off saying nothing's been marked so far.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We just have an empty data structure.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Then what we're going to do is loop through all the nodes in the graph

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
because we don't know which ones are going to be the beginnings

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of a new component or not.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
For each one that we visit, we say if that node hasn't been marked

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
in some previous iteration, then we've got a new component.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
This node that we're just visiting is a part of that component.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So we say, "Hey, we've got a component containing node node."

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Then what we do is we recursively go

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and mark all the things connected to that node,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
count up how many things got marked in that way, and then we return.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So what we know is there was a component, it contained node node,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and it has a certain count to it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
When it's done that, it moves on to the next node.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
A bunch of these have probably already been marked,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
so they just get skipped really quickly,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but eventually it maybe reaches a node that hasn't been marked

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
because it wasn't connected to anything so far.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Prints that one out and continues.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So this really is very explicitly what we were doing by hand,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
just one piece at a time.
