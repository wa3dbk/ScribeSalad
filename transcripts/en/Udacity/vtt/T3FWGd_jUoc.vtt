00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.520
The second model is
called the Hosted model.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.252
In this model, at the lowest level,
there is a full fledged host operating

00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:10.568
system that manages all of
the hardware resources.

00:00:10.568 --> 00:00:16.030
The Host OS integrates a virtual machine
monitor module, that's responsible for

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.947
providing the virtual machines with
their virtual platform interface and

00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:25.020
for managing all of the context
switching scheduling, etc.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.519
As necessary,
this VMM module will invoke drivers or

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.340
other components of the host
operating system as needed.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.604
This one benefit of this model is that
it can leverage all of the services and

00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:40.679
mechanisms that are already developed
for the host operating system.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.169
Much less functionality
needs to be redeveloped for

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.240
the VMM Module in this manner.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.724
Also, note that on this host operating
system, you may run Guest VM's

00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:55.660
through the Virtual Machine Module, but
you can also run Native Applications

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.640
directly on the host operating
system as you would in general.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.438
One example of the Hosted model is KVM,
which stands for kernel-based VM.

00:01:05.438 --> 00:01:08.319
That's based on the Linux
operating system.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:13.484
The Linux host provides all aspects of
the physical hardware management and

00:01:13.484 --> 00:01:18.660
just like any regular OS, it can run
directly regular Linux applications.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.924
The support for running Guest Virtual
Machines is through a combination of

00:01:23.924 --> 00:01:29.620
our kernel module, that's the KVM module
and a hardware emulator called QEMU.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.659
We said that the goal of virtualization
is to provide identical hardware.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.459
So here,
this emulator is used as a virtualizer.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.535
It really matches the underlying
hardware resources,

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.700
the X86 Intel or AMD.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.675
The support for running SVMs in
KVM is through a combination

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:54.260
of a kernel module KVM and
a hardware emulator, QEMU.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.686
We said that virtualization the intent
is to provide identical hardware, so

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:04.699
this QEMU emulator isn't emulating
some bizarre hardware platform.

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:09.300
Instead, it's used in what's
called a virtualizer mode.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.740
So the resources that are available
to the Guest VM are actually

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.931
the exact hardware resources
from the physical platform,

00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:22.542
except that this virtualizer
intervenes during certain types of

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:26.398
critical operations or
specific instructions or re,

00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:30.879
relative to pass control to
the KVM Module and the Host OS.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.843
One example of that would be
any aspect of IO management,

00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:38.973
because all of the support for
devices, the device drivers

00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:43.280
are handled as part of the Linux
operating system the Host OS.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.570
A huge benefit for

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.644
KVM has been that it's able to really
leverage all of the advances that

00:02:49.644 --> 00:02:55.580
are continuously being contributed to
the large Linux open-source community.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.099
Because of this KVM can quickly
adapt to new hardware features,

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.959
new devices, new security,
bugs or similar things.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.883
In fact, the KVM Module was originally
developed as a Linux module in order to

00:03:08.883 --> 00:03:11.915
allow regular use of Linux
applications to take

00:03:11.915 --> 00:03:14.492
advantage of some of the virtualization

00:03:14.492 --> 00:03:18.840
related hardware that started
appearing in commodity platforms.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.784
All of the sudden, users realized
that this can be useful to actually

00:03:23.784 --> 00:03:28.059
run guest operating system and
regular virtual machines.

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:32.976
And so three months later, KVM was an
actual virtualization solution that was

00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:35.370
part of the mainstream Linux kernel.
