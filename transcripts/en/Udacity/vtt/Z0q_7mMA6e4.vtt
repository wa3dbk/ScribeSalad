00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, how did you solve the problem?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The naive or straightforward or brute force way of solving this problem

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is to actually take all of these numbers, multiply them together, divide that answer by 5,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and see what the remainder is. If the remainder is 0, then it is divisible by 5.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Otherwise, it's not. But you would be very silly to go through that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What you should do is realize that a product is going to be divisible by 5

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
if and only if one of the number that you're multiplying into the product is divisible by 5.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And a number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is a 0 or a 5.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What you can do now, instead of actually doing any multiplying,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
you just scan your eyes down the columns here and notice that most of them are not 0s or 5s,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but if you're eagle-eyed, you would have noticed this.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There's one number in there that's divisible by 5--945--

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and that's all it takes. The whole product is now going to be divisible by 5.

00:00:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The answer we're looking for is yes. The product is divisible by 5. Ta da!
