00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.808
During roughly the elementary school years, from about seven to 11, give or

00:00:03.808 --> 00:00:07.560
take, children move into the third stage of cognitive development according to

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.822
PAJ. He called this stage the Concrete Operational Stage. Now, we already

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:18.937
defined operation, as the ability to figure things out just in ones head. So,

00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:23.000
this is the primary skill at this age. One of the best examples of this, is how

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.948
children at this stage can do basic math just in their head. For example, 5

00:00:27.948 --> 00:00:31.982
plus 5 is 10. They no longer need to count, add or subtract using their fingers

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:36.658
or other objects. Conservation is now possible because of the mental capability

00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:41.064
of saying something, like, oh. Well, those 2 look different. But I know that

00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:45.431
that's really the same. Concrete refers to the fact that children in this stage

00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:52.044
reason and think about concrete things. Not abstract ones. Abstract ideas and

00:00:52.044 --> 00:00:55.938
reasoning happen in the next and final stage of cognitive development, Formal

00:00:55.938 --> 00:00:59.210
Operations, which begins in adolescence.
