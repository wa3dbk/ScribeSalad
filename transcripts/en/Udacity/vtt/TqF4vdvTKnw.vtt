00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
All right so to compute this quantity, what we need to do is first take a look at the neighbors of ORD.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In this case, we've got Seattle, Los Angeles, Dallas Forth Worth, not Atlanta but Pittsburgh.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So Kv which is the number of neighbors is 4.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And then we have to count up the number of edges between these neighbor cities.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So in this particular case we've got one edge between Seattle and Los Angeles.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
One between Los Angeles and Dallas and that's it.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Pittsburgh doesn't have any edges that connect to any other pink nodes. So that makes this value 2.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now we need to apply the formula for the clustering coefficient

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to see what value we get from this case.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And the formula says it's 2 times the number of links.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Divided by the degree times 1 minus the degree. So in this case we get 1/3.
