00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.494
This one is correct. We can see that 5,000 is included in the area that's

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:09.352
shaded. And then, the teal line shows that every value to the right of 5,000 on

00:00:09.352 --> 00:00:14.377
the number line, or that is, every real number greater than 5,000, satisfies the

00:00:14.377 --> 00:00:15.880
inequality for profit.
