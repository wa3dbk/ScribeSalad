00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.250
I want to painfully step through this one line of code here,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.270
which in Dimple, binds our data to the SVG that we want to draw the chart in.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.410
Replacing this line of code in dimple.js with the equivalent d3 statement,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.110
we can see here that in d3 there's actually five functions we have to run.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.410
While using d3's chainable syntax, we could write this all on one line.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.189
I think it's much more clearer of what's happening when you write each new

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.730
function called on a separate line.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.320
I wanted to step through each one of these function calls, and

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.020
then the web browsers chrome console.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.770
I want to inspect what gets passed in and what gets returned from each.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.440
As you can see here, I put a debugger before and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.700
after the d3 code that binds data to our SVG object in circles.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.400
And I also comped out adding the header title since we're not actually going to

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.500
be drawing the entire chart, but walking through only the data binding process.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.180
In the last bit of code I've added are some diagrams visually explaining

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.710
the data binding process to the webpage itself as an image.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.740
Opening up the Chrome debugger tools by going to the top right menu,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.700
scrolling down to Tools then JavaScript Console.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.930
We can see here the console threw an error since we

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.860
removed the dimple.js code that actually created the chart.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.380
Let's refresh the page.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.290
So our debugger touches before any of our chart code.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.740
After reloading the page we can see here the first debugger statement caught.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.850
What I'll be showing on the webpage itself are some diagrams I

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.300
created that visually explain what's happening with the d3 code here.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.176
Before we call the .data function, all we have is SVG on the page and

00:01:56.176 --> 00:01:59.760
the worldcup.tsv data file,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.570
which has been loaded via AJAX using the d3 convenience function.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.800
If we inspect our data variable, just like previously, it's a JavaScript array.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.490
In this case with 836 elements,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.190
each of which is an object with a bunch of fields.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.160
Remember that the Chrome Developer Tools provided a convenience function

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.460
to print out a tabular representation of a data file such as this.
