00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.567
So, let's take a minute to look at the graph of f of p equals 1 minus 3p

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:10.864
squared. We can see there are two different roots here. But for this problem,

00:00:10.864 --> 00:00:15.211
we're just going to focus on this one. You can choose any intervals you want to

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:18.802
approximate the location of x intercepts, depending on how accurately you

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:24.310
want to know their values. To approximate this 0 a bit more closely, we need to

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.698
divide our interval into smaller sections than we did before. So, let's use a

00:00:29.698 --> 00:00:36.245
distance of 0.5 this time for the interval between -2 and 0. Please take a

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:40.670
minute to fill in the missing information for f of x, and then answer the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.483
question, as zero is between blank and blank.
