00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.370
So the question is, given any variable, we're going

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.820
to introduce the variable S, and we're going to assign it

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.250
any string. Which of the pairs below are two

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.090
things where both elements of the pair are the same

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.050
exact value? So here are the choices. Check all

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.910
the choices where the first thing and the second thing

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.060
have exactly the same value. So the first thing is

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.630
S index 3, S index 1 plus 1 plus 1.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.240
So, for any string that we choose for S, those two always have exactly the same

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.010
value, then you should check this box. Second, we have S index 0 paired

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.865
with S plus S, index 0. For the third

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:46.265
choice, we have S index 0 plus S index 1 paired

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:50.868
with S index 0 plus 1. For the

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:57.446
fourth choice, we have S index 1 paired with S plus the

00:00:57.446 --> 00:01:03.880
string ity index 1. And for the fifth and final choice, we

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.640
have S index negative 1, and remember, the negative indexes go from the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.850
back of the string, paired with S plus S index negative 1.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.920
So for this question, you should check all the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.840
boxes where the two items in the pair have

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.940
exactly the same value, no matter what value S

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.140
has, as long as S is a valid string.
