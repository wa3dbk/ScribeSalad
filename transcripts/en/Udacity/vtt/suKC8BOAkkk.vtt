00:00:04.941 --> 00:00:07.467
JavaScript includes many different syntaxes and

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:09.639
techniques to accomplish the same goals.

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.754
Just thinking about what we learned about objects alone,

00:00:12.754 --> 00:00:16.990
there are at least three different ways of defining objects.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.090
Literal, dot, and bracket notation.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.995
When you start debugging other people's code,

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:26.790
you're going to have to wade through almost two decades of different syntax and

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.120
techniques, layered one on top of the other.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.180
&gt;&gt; You know what?

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.810
This sounds like a great quiz to me.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.130
This course isn't long enough to introduce everybody to all of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.250
the nuances of JavaScript.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.350
In fact, you could spend more than a hundred hours in a JavaScrip class without

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.110
getting a complete picture of the language.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.500
I think I see where you're going with this.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.200
Let's give students a piece of JavaScript, with some syntax they haven't yet

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.780
encountered, and see if they can figure it out.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.720
&gt;&gt; This piece of code should look familiar.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.680
You saw something similar a few exercises ago,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.500
when you're tracking click locations on a website.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.470
There's this weird syntax here, with function, location, console.log, etc.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.190
What is going on here?

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.280
What is document.click taking as a parameter?

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.140
Do some research, try testing it out in DevTools, and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.040
put your thoughts right here.
