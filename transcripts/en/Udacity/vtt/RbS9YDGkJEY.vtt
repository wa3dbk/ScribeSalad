00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's start with the first expression. This one over here doesn't depend on sigma at all.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hence, the derivative 0. The derivative of logσ is 1/σ.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And this expression is funky because you have a σ⁻² in the denominator.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That results to 1/σ³ and then -2 multiplied in cancels the minus 1/2 over here

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
very conveniently to with we have all these sigmas in the denominator.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We multiply up σ³ which gives σ² over here and leaves only this expression on the right side.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Taking out σ² to the left side, we observe that we have Nσ² in the sum.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We get Nσ² and bringing N to the right gives us σ.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is the full proof that the empirical observed variance over the data

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is the maximum likelihood estimator for finding the parameters of a Gaussian.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If you got this far, I am impressed.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We left basic statistics way behind us and got into fairly heavy math.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Thanks for taking this unit. If you just clicked forward and hit the next button, never mind.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You can complete the do you understand basic statistics

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
without understanding how it's being derived

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's move on and use the Gaussian for something practical.
