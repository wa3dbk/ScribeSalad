00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.670
This program is vulnerable.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.550
This really simplified program what
it's doing is something similar to what

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.230
a password checking program might do.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.450
Think about what the program is doing,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.740
this is our main
function as the program.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.960
It has take some arguments.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.000
It has bunch of local variables.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.820
It has an integer that's value at
the end is going to be should login be

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.540
allowed or not allowed.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.000
It has a local variable
of size no more than 12.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.622
Well that's where we're going to read
the password that we're going to ask

00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:31.010
the user to type.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.210
And then we have to compare that with

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.070
something that we know about
the password of the user.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.770
So the target password here really
is the password we are looking for.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.880
Here is a really poor practice here,
but the target password is hard coded.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.470
Other thing I should mention here
is that password checking programs

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.220
actually don't need to keep your
password because then if somebody

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.390
gains control of that then
they know your password also.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.820
So these are sort of the local variables
that we declare in this function.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.370
This is where we get to this code.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.900
The code is very simple.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.780
It's saying I'm going to get a string.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.870
Gets is read a string function get
a string that you're going to type.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.210
We're going to read that string into
this local variable pwdstr that we

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.060
declared, then we're going to do
a comparison of the string that we just

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.950
read into pwdstr against our target
password, which is my password 123.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.620
This string compare actually is,
this variant says at most

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.620
12 character long strings and the result
of this comparison, if the two strings

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.610
are identical then it returns a 0,
otherwise it returns a non zero value.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.420
So read more about this function
to find out exactly what

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.460
it returns in the other cases,
less than zero or greater than zero.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.834
So in this case, allow_login = 1,

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:56.330
after that we going to say if
allow_login = 0, remember that was

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.070
the initial value, we had shown that
we don't allow unless there is a match.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.440
Remember the fail safe
defaults we talked about?

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.860
So the default here is don't allow.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.680
So that's why we're setting it to zero.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.910
So if the variable is not set to 1 as
a result of a successful comparison

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.660
then it's still 0 then in that case we
are going to reject the log in request.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.040
Otherwise the match was successful.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.230
We set it to 1, so in that case,
we're going to allow the log in request.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.350
But the goal here is to understand how
vulnerable our code gets exploited.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.850
So we want to see how
this code gets exploited.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.270
And this simple program that
we have here helps us do that.
