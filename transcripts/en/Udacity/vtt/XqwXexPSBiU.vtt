00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.705
The answer is $900. Great work if you figured that one out. We know in our first

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:11.090
case we work 35 hours and we earn $630. For the second case we're going to work

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.108
50 hours but we don't know how much money we're going to get. So we'll use x for

00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:20.128
that income two. Next we want to multiply both sides of our equation by the

00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:25.680
lowest common denominator or 50 times x. So we'll be left with 35 times x on the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.340
left and 630 times 50 on the right. Essentially when we do this we cross

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.710
multiply. We'll have x time 35 here, and 50 times 630 here. Finally, we divide

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.408
both sides by 35, and we get x is equal to 900. When you're problem solving, you

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:45.676
want to make sense of this number in the end. What were we solving for? Well we

00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:50.686
were wondering how much we could make, so that means we made $900. I know I

00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:54.158
included the unit here for you, but make sure you do that in your own problem

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:56.323
solving and throughout the rest of your work.
