00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.700
When you're creating
apps like Email Clients,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.820
there will be times when there
are many emails that have arrived.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.430
On a handheld,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.810
you will be shown a notification that
looks like this using inbox style.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.340
When you touch the notification,
it will open up on the Email Client and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.790
show you all the emails.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.190
On a wearable, you would like to see
more information about the emails

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.800
without having to pull
out the handheld device.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.790
It's possible to create a series of
notifications, one for each email and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.260
then stack will group them together.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.240
The notifications are initially
shown as a single card.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.690
That can be expanded into
multiple cards by touching it.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.890
So here we create
a separate notification for

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.970
each email our app knows about.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.750
You can see that we add the sender here
and the subject here for each email.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.010
Now, we use the setGroup method to
specify a unique key for this group.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.680
So Android Wear knows which
notifications should be

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.870
stacked together.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.900
We then issue this like
any other notification.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.450
And here is another notification for
a second email.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.760
You'll notice the use of setGroup here,
just like the previous one.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.890
And we issue this notification
in the same way as well.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.080
The final step is to create
the notification for

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.060
the phone like it's shown here.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.190
Clearly we don't want the individual
emails to each get a notification on

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.620
the handheld device.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.170
This code sample creates the inbox
style shown in the previous image.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.580
It adds a summary of all the emails
in a nice format that's perfect for

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.540
showing on a handheld device.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.770
The interesting part is the code is
setGroup here, and setGroupSummary here.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.780
This makes the notification
part of the previous group, but

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.920
we've specified that this is the summary
of the group by passing true here.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.270
Summary is shown on the phone while
the other group items are shown

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.380
on the Android Wear device.
