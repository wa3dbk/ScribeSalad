00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.950
Geofencing combines awareness of
the user's current location and

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.520
nearby features,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.680
defined by the user's proximity to
locations that may be of interest.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.250
For example,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.740
consider this case where there are a
couple coffee stores on this street.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.640
As the user gets close to a store,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.120
the app could give them
notification of a special offer.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.610
For example, come in the next five
minutes and you'll get your coffee for

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.120
half price.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.310
As the user exits the area for
that store, the notification could be

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.620
removed too, in order to play nice and
not clutter their notification tray.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.080
In this case, a geofence could be
drawn around each of the coffee shops.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.730
And, when the user enters that geofence,
a notification is triggered,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.010
letting them know that
they're in the coffee shop.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.980
And, when they exit the geofence,
another notification could be triggered,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.750
or functionality, for example, to clear
any notifications could be triggered.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.560
Now, let's take a look at
how you would build this.
