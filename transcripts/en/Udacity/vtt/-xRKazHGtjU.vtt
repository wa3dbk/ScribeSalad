00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.120
The so-called Knapsack Problem is
another famous thought exercise in

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.930
computer science.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.980
Here we have a theoretical knapsack
with a limited weight capacity, and

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.860
more items that can possibly fit in it.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.669
Each item has a weight and a value.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.110
The question here is, how can I optimize
the total value of items in my knapsack,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.830
given the weight constraint?

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.279
We'll focus on the 0-1 knapsack problem,
where you only have

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.370
one of each object and you must
either take or leave a whole object.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.460
In some other variants,
you can take a fraction of an object.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.220
When I heard about this problem,
my first thought was,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.240
just put the objects with
the highest values in first.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.800
but what if putting the two elements
with the highest values hit the weight

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.780
limit, but putting all the other
elements in together would actually fit

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.920
and have a higher value?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.250
There aren't a lot of actual
knapsacks in computer science, but

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.870
this problem describes an optimization
issue that crops up often.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.440
Before devising the best solution,
particularly if you're stuck, it can be

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.670
helpful to think of the solution
that's slow but straightforward.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.650
Here we could try every
combination of objects and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.100
just pick the one that's best,
also called the brute force solution.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.670
The runtime of the solution is on
the order of 2 raised to the n,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.530
where n is the number of objects.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.510
There are actually 2 to
the n possible combinations.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.410
There's a precise mathematical
reason for this, but

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.899
you could also think of one
combination as a string of length n,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.289
where each spot has a 1 if it's in
the knapsack or a 0 if it's left out.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.200
That means this is an exponential time
algorithm, since the n is an exponent.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.480
We would prefer
a polynomial time algorithm

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.320
where the n is multiplied by something
else or has a constant number for

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.759
an exponent, which is going to be
much faster for large numbers.
