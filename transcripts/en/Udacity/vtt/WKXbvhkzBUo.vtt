00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.280
So there is a taxonomy called
Flynn's Taxonomy of Parallel Machines.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.790
It distinguishes parallel machines
according to how many instruction

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.390
streams they have and how many data
streams these instructions operate on.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.970
The first type of machine is single
instruction, single data, or SISD,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.870
and logically this type of machine
executes one instruction stream,

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.180
and each instruction
operates on one data stream.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.890
This is really your normal uniprocessor.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.655
So if we have for example, a single
core machine, that's what it is.

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:41.445
The next type of machine is single
instruction, multiple data.

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:43.845
So it executes one instruction stream,

00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:48.110
meaning there is one program with
a single program counter we go through,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.570
but there is more than one
data stream they operate on.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.050
The most common example of this used
to be so-called vector processors,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.450
which execute a program.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.510
But each instruction, instead of
operating on normal scalar values,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.720
operates on vectors.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.290
So, for example,
you can execute an ad instruction, but

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.980
it operates on two source and
one destination vector of things.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.100
So it operates on many many
data items at the time.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.770
Modern processors also have this
multimedia extension instruction,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.570
such as MMX or SSE 1, 2, 3, and
they're also an example of limited SIMD.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.580
Where a single multimedia instruction
will operate on maybe four or

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.110
eight data items.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.850
Then you can have a multiple
instruction single data stream.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.800
This is weird, because we have
multiple instruction streams.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.910
So there are several different
programs executing at the same time,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.240
all operating on
the same stream of data.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.040
So it's not used much and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.720
the closest we get to this is
something like a stream processor.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.350
Where you have the first processor
operating on, for example,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.880
the raw data from the camera,
and then that data moves on to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.360
the next processor which is
going to process it some further.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.419
Like find the edges, or sharpen it,
or something and so on.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.710
But even there, it's not truly that
we have a single data stream, because

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.790
the output of the first processor is
not the same as the raw camera feed.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.590
So this is just kind of
the closest we get to it, but

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.550
really, MISD is not really used much.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.000
And then we have MIMD, where there is
more than one instruction stream and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.940
more than one data stream.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.960
And this would be your normal
multiprocessor where each processor has

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.060
its own program that it's running with
its own program counter and zone, and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.480
each of them operates on its own data.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.310
So they don't have to do things in
lock step to operate on the data, and

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.710
they don't do something
like a stream processing.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.330
So this type of processor really
includes most of the processors you can

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.640
buy today because most
processors today are multi-core,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.480
which means really they have
several processor cores.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.890
Each of which executes it's
own instruction stream and

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.770
can access data independently,
so it has multiple data streams.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.430
And this lesson is mostly
about this type of machines.
