00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.240
The solutions to this absolute value equation are 1 half, or 3. If you got the

00:00:04.252 --> 00:00:08.875
right answers, great job. Let's see how we got these answers. This time, I have

00:00:08.887 --> 00:00:13.435
an absolute value equation, but I have an extra term next to the absolute value.

00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:18.084
Before I can split my absolute value equation into two cases, I have to isolate

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:23.098
the aboslute value first. So I can do that by subtracting. 2 from both sides.

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:29.465
Then, I have the absolute value of 4 x minus 7 equals 5. Now that my absolute

00:00:29.477 --> 00:00:35.760
value is isolated, I can split it into two cases. I have 4 x minus 7 equals 5,

00:00:35.772 --> 00:00:41.743
and 4 x minus 7 equals negative 5. So, let's solve this one first. I add 7 to

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:47.753
both sides, 4 x equals 12. I divide both sides by 4, and I get x equals 3. For

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:53.988
the negative case, when I add 7 to both sides, I get 4 x equals 2. When I divide

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.443
both sides by 4, I get x equals 2 4th. Remember, whenever I have a fraction, I

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:04.815
have to make sure I put it in lowest terms or in reduced form. So, 2 4th is the

00:01:04.827 --> 00:01:09.830
same as 1 half. And that's how we got 3 and 1 half. Let's try just a couple more

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:12.337
absolute value equation problems.
