00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.260
Angular's got a ton of moving parts, but

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.110
we finally made it to the last
one we'll be looking at, routing.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.890
Up until this point we've worked
with apps that have just one view.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.390
And that's fine, but
it's not very functional or interactive.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.260
Single page applications typically
have many different views or

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.500
screens that you can interact with.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.700
A router handles loading
these views based on the URL.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.220
When we generate an angular
app with Yo Angular,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.070
it asks us if we want to
include a number of modules.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.780
One of the options is angular-route.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.500
This routing module works well, but

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.310
it's kind of limited since it
doesn't allow for nested views.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.870
We want to have specific
sections of the page update and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.560
change while the rest stays the same.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.860
So instead of using this
angular-route module,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.509
we'll use the community built
routing module called UI Router.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.890
The documentation for the UI Router
module is incredibly detailed.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.790
Make sure to also check out the website
in the sample app to see all

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.550
of the functionality UI Router offers.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.780
Since UI Router doesn't come as
part of the default installation,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.700
we need to add it to our project.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.380
The Angular generator uses
Bower to install Angular.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.860
So let's use Bower to install ui-router.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.950
Don't forget to add the -s to save
ui-router to the Bower config file.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.110
One of the files that's created when
we generate an app with the yoangular

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.890
command is a Grunt file.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.180
This file manages a lot of
the development process,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.340
from watching files for
changes to reloading the browser.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.190
One of the cool things is that
it can pair with other commands,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.180
like the bower command we just used.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.210
When we installed ui-router with bower,
grunt saw that and

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.450
included it in our index file.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.335
Everything that we've been building up
to this point has all been inside our

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:32.220
udaciMeals module.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.625
We created the module and then attached
controllers and services to it.

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:39.350
Ui-router is a module itself and
contains its own inner components.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.870
Back when we created our module we
passed an empty array of dependencies.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.370
Now we have to add ui-router
to that list so we can use it.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.690
Just like injecting
a service into a controller,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.730
to inject one module into another
we just add the name as a string.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.542
So this is injecting the ui-router
module into our udaciMealsApp module.

00:01:56.542 --> 00:02:00.742
A word of caution though,
all over the docs it's ui-router, but

00:02:00.742 --> 00:02:03.250
when you include it it's ui.router.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.230
This little guy's tripped
me up several times.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.320
So watch out that he
doesn't get you too.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.970
We've looked at why ui-router is
better than the default router module.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.784
We've added ui-router to our project,
and

00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:15.670
we've injected it into
the udaciMeals module.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.420
Let's take a look at how to
set up ui-router to manage

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.160
the state of our app.
