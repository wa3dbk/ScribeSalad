00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.940
The future of data visualization looks very bright.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.540
And I hope that you've learned a lot in this class.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.900
Ryan, if there's something that a student taking this class walks away from

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.010
learning in this course, what would you hope that would be?

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.200
&gt;&gt; The one thing that I want everyone to walk away with is that anyone can do

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.200
data visualization.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.480
You don't necessarily need to be the best coder or the best designer.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.560
But with a few simple tools and concepts,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.130
you too can create a data visualization that is both beautiful and compelling.

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:27.300
&gt;&gt; I want to thank you for taking this course, and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.270
I hope you had as much fun going through the material as we had producing it.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.730
And while we covered a lot of ground, both on the theory and practice of

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.030
data visualization, we learned how to code using D3 to create visualizations for

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.470
the web, there's still much more to learn.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.170
I encourage all of you to join us at Ziptheme Academy or

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.300
use the wealth of online resources to continue learning and

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.990
creating visualizations of your own to share with the world.
