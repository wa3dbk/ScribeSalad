00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.608
The answer is 6 root 5, or 6 times the square root of 5.

00:00:05.608 --> 00:00:08.653
There are however a couple of steps between the last step I showed you and

00:00:08.653 --> 00:00:13.570
this answer, so let's talk about them. We know that square roots are the same as

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.300
exponents of one-half. So we can rewrite this as 6 squared times 5 all

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.250
to the one-half power. You learned earlier though,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.745
about how exponents distribute to factors inside a term. That means this is also

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:31.640
equal to 6 squared to the one-half times 5 to the one-half. Which, of course,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.090
we can return to radical notation. The square root of 6 squared is just 6.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.710
And the square root of 5 is an irrational number.
