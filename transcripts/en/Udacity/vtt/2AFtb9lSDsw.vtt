00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.850
The third principle of knowledge based AI agents in CS7637 is that reasoning is

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.120
typically top-down as well as bottom-up. Ordinarily, we assume that data is

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.530
coming from the world and most of the reasoning is bottom-up as we interpret

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.231
the data. In contrast to knowledge based AI, low level processing of the data

00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:23.840
results in the invocation of knowledge structures from memory. These knowledge

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.890
structures then generate expectations, and the reasoning becomes top down.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.080
Frames were an example of this kind of top down reasoning. We had the input,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.810
Angela ate lasagna with her dad last night at Olive Garden. And

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.960
the processing of this input led it to the invocation of this particular frame.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.080
Once this frame has been pulled out of memory,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.550
then this particular frame can generate a lot of expectations. For example,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.740
was the object alive when Angela ate it? False. Where is the object now?

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.400
Inside the subject. What is the subject's mood after she had dinner?

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.300
She was happy. A similar kind of top down generation of expectations occurred

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.570
when we used frames to understand simple sentences about earthquakes.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.960
Scripts are another example of this kind of top-down generation of

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.918
expectations and expectation based processing. Once we have a script,

00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:15.727
then that script generates expectations over the next action.

00:01:15.727 --> 00:01:17.195
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:21.250
It tells us what to look for in the world, even before that happens. And

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.480
when that doesn't happen, we know an expectation has been violated and we

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.240
are surprised. Constraint propagation is another way of thinking about top down

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.040
processing. We will input data in the form of pixels representing this cube.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.690
We have to infer that this image, in fact,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.090
is that of a cube. We have knowledge about this constraint of various kind of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.820
junctions that can occur in the world of cubes and this knowledge then generates

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.232
expectations of what might be a blade and what might be a fold. This notion of

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:51.601
top-down processing using knowledge structures to generate expectations of

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:55.980
the world in order to be able to interpret data essential to knowledge based AI.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.418
It's also deeply connected with human cognition.

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:02.900
Some current theories of human cognition think of brains as predictive machines.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.030
We are constantly generating expectations, we are constantly making predictions

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.900
over the world, that guide our reasoning, that guide our actions.
