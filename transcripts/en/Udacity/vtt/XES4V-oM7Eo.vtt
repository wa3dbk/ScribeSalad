00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.536
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know that in order to graph these two curves, we simply set y equal to

00:00:04.536 --> 00:00:09.742
each side of the equation that we originally started with. So the two lines that

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:14.812
we have are this orange one, whose equation is y equals 3x squared plus 7x minus

00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:19.943
10, and this black one whose equation is y equals 2x squared plus 5x plus 5. Now

00:00:19.943 --> 00:00:24.866
these points of intersection are points that lie on both of these curves. So

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:29.229
that means the coordinates these points satisfy each of these equations. We

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:33.702
already know the x coordinates of each point so all we need to do now to figure

00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:38.246
out the corresponding y coordinates is to pick either of these equations and

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:42.717
plug in each x coordinate. So I'm kind of feeling this one right here. Doesn't

00:00:42.717 --> 00:00:46.892
matter which one you choose though. You'll get the same answer regardless of

00:00:46.892 --> 00:00:51.252
which equation you pick. So starting with this equation I'm going to plug in the

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:55.529
negative 5 to see what y value corresponds to that x value on both curves. When

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:59.647
I plug in x equals negative 5 I end up with y equals 30. So that means that the

00:00:59.647 --> 00:01:04.336
coordinates of this point must be negative five comma 30. Now let's do the same

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:09.653
thing with x equal three, for this point. Solving for y when x equal three gives

00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:14.830
us 38, so we have the point three comma 38 as our other point of intersection.
