00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.225
Let's try to write down an algorithm that systematizes how we solve it. And

00:00:04.225 --> 00:00:07.726
we're going to write this as pseudocode. That means we're not worrying about the

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:11.656
details of how to write exactly correct Python. We're trying to get the idea

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:15.083
down and see if it makes sense. So let's think about how we solve the problem as

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:18.872
a human again. Here's how we start it. We looked at our start date, which was

00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:23.042
January 24. And we counted the number of days remaining in January. We do that

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:26.353
by just counting up. If we started earlier we might not want to have counted

00:00:26.353 --> 00:00:29.938
every day. So we can subtract the total number of days in January from the day

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:33.582
we started. So that will be our starting point. And we're going to keep the

00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:38.070
results in a variable called days and we'll start by initializing days into the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.604
number of days in the current month minus the day that we're starting on. So, for

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:49.004
the example, that was 31, for the number of days in January, minus 24, which, I

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:53.860
believe is 7. And once we've done that, well, we finished month1, so we should

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.808
increase the value of month1 by 1. So now we were at February and now we started

00:00:57.808 --> 00:01:00.974
going through the months, until we got to the month we are on. So we went

00:01:00.974 --> 00:01:04.628
through each month until we got up to the month we were looking for, which was

00:01:04.628 --> 00:01:08.380
June. So that's sort of like a while loop. We're doing something over and over

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.376
again until we get to the stopping condition. So we can write that as

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:17.428
pseudocode. We're going to keep going while the current month is less than the

00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:21.774
target month. We're going to add the number of days in the current month. And

00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:25.369
we're going to increase the current month by 1. Now, we're not quite done we

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.310
still need to account for the day in the month that we arrived at. And there we

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.752
just add that day so if it was day one of June then we would add one, since we

00:01:32.752 --> 00:01:37.437
didn't actually get in to June. Now, we're going to add 29 since the 29th was

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:41.302
our target day. We haven't yet accounted for years, for this example it was

00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:44.902
okay. But, for other cases, we're going to need to account for years, so let's

00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:48.548
think about how to do that. We can do it similarly to how we accounted for

00:01:48.548 --> 00:01:52.548
month. Well, we're not up to the same year. We're going to add the number of

00:01:52.548 --> 00:01:53.713
days in that year.
