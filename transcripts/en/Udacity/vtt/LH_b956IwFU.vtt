00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.662
This last choice is correct. Fantastic reasoning if you figured that one out. As

00:00:04.662 --> 00:00:09.562
an example, the first number could be 4 and the second one could be 0. We know 4

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:15.195
times 0 equals 0. And let's say the second number is 5. 0 times 5 equals 0. Now,

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:20.403
I don't actually know that one of the numbers is 4 or the other is 5, but one of

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:23.323
them must equal 0, since our product is 0.
