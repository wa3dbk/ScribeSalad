00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.221
Frist we will discuss active power. The active

00:00:03.221 --> 00:00:05.749
power can be computed as one half of the

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:09.620
total capacitance of the circuit, where the capacitance

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.070
can be seen as roughly proportional to chip area.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.050
So, larger chips will have more of this.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.530
The next factor is voltage square. This is the

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.642
power supply voltage. The higher the power supply

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:25.490
voltage, the higher the power is. And this relationship

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.366
is quadratic. So, doubling of the power supply

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.460
voltage will actually quadruple the power. The next

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.550
factor is clock frequency. This is the gigahertz

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.240
number that you normally see on a processor

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.100
specification. And finally, the alpha is the activity

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.880
factor. Without this alpha, we are assuming that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.660
the processor is constantly switching every clock cycle

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.825
all of it's transistors. So, alpha really says that,

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:54.020
for example, only 10% of the process transistors

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.350
are actually active in any give clock cycle.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.830
Now, let's see what happens to power, if,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.540
after two years, we reduce the size of the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.330
processor to one half of what it was,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.880
because of technology improvement. The new capacitance is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.720
half of what it was for one processor.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.860
However, because we want to build a more powerful processor,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.452
we put two of them on the chip. So, the

00:01:18.452 --> 00:01:20.970
C new really is equal to C old. Let's say

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.760
that the voltage and the frequency stay the same, and

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.940
let's say that it's still the same processor design, so

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.790
the same percentage of transistors are active. That means really

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.670
that the active power is relatively unchanged if we do

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.915
this. What we have is effectively a processor that consumes

00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:40.915
the same amount of power, but it does have twice

00:01:40.915 --> 00:01:43.390
the number of cores that it had before,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.440
so it's, it's actually twice its capable computationally,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.065
because each of those cores is still operating

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:53.335
at the same frequency before. And it's really a

00:01:53.335 --> 00:01:55.965
very similar to the old core. In reality,

00:01:55.965 --> 00:01:58.805
smaller transistors are going to be faster, so we

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:01.787
can increase the clock frequency of the processor

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:05.977
too. So, let's say that the new clock frequency

00:02:05.977 --> 00:02:12.587
is 25% higher than the old one. That increases the power consumed. So, it's

00:02:12.587 --> 00:02:14.631
now twice as fast, because of the

00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:18.810
number of cores. Another 25% improvement because of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.500
this. But the overall power consumption is

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.390
now higher. Smaller transistors, however, may let

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.436
us lower the power supply voltage while

00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:31.097
maintaining the same speed. So, let's say that

00:02:31.097 --> 00:02:34.100
the new power supply voltage is equal to

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.850
0.8 of the old power supply voltage. That

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.020
allows us to have a significantly lower power

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.396
consumption because of this square relationship. So 0.8 squared

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:48.130
is 0.64. If we put these two together,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.370
we can get something like the voltage. We don't

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.580
lower it as much, because if we did,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.130
then we couldn't also increase the frequency, so we

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.960
lower it only a little bit. The frequency, we

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.380
can not increase it as much, because if we did,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.970
we would have to keep the same power supply voltage

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.900
as before, so let's say we only increase the frequency

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.050
by a factor of 1.1. If you now apply this

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.570
equation, we get that the new power is about 90%

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.450
of the old power. So, what we got is now,

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.566
we have a chip that is having two cores instead

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:24.800
of one. It has a lower power supply voltage,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.720
but a higher frequency. So, each of these cores is

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.377
10% faster than the one used to be. And

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:33.332
yet, we have lowered power consumption. This is why it's

00:03:33.332 --> 00:03:35.884
so important for active power to have the technology

00:03:35.884 --> 00:03:39.290
improvement to reduce the size of transistors. And we also

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.970
have to realize that in order to get power

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.180
improvements, we really, really, really need to lower the voltage.
