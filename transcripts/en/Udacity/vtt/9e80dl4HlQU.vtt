00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.108
The way that we factor it tells us that our two critical values, the two points

00:00:04.108 --> 00:00:08.301
that are splitting our number line up are x equals negative 7 and x equals 5. So

00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:12.257
I start by writing those. Then we just need to fill in the intervals surronding

00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:16.305
those values. We have x is less than negative seven then we have the region

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:20.233
between negative 7 and 5. So negative seven is less than x which is less than

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:22.640
five. And then lastly, x is greater than five.
