00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.480
First, let's look at conceptual integrity, which I mentioned earlier in today's

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.650
lesson. Let me give you two historical quotes that, that give an idea of what

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.190
conceptual integrity is all about. The first is from the philosopher Descartes.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.350
He said of these thoughts on the very first that occurred to me was, that there

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.850
is seldom so much perfection in works composed of many separate parts,.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.630
Upon which different hands had been employed,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.820
as in those completed by a single master. More recently, Fred Brooks, in,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.780
The Mythical Man-Month, has said much the same thing. I will contend that

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.550
conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.810
It is better to have a system omit. Certain anomalous features and

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.390
improvements, but to reflect one set of design ideas, then to have one that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.930
contains many independent, and uncoordinated ideas. A couple of related concepts

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.090
are coupling and cohesion. These originally came out of structure design, but

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.120
they also apply to object orientated design, and other design approaches.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.100
Assuming you've carved your system into separate components, those components

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.630
may be coupled to each other. Coupling is the extent to which two components

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.110
depend on each other for successful execution. If you think about it for

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.020
a minute low coupling is good. After you've delivered your system,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.330
and you have to maintain it. If you have a highly coupled system, and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.890
you change one module, that means that you're likely to have to change other

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.450
modules. Whereas if there's low coupling, that likelihood goes down.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.760
A related concept is cohesion. With cohesion we're talking about

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.340
a single module, and cohesion is the extent to which that module, or

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.760
component has a single purpose or function. High cohesion is good.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.150
For example highly cohesive modules are much more easy to reuse.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.310
They have a single purpose. You need to reuse them to accomplish that purpose.
