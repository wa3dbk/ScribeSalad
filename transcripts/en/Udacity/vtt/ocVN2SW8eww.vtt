00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.030
It's great to understand the numbers
because the metrics are the foundation

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.960
that you need in order to make
the right decisions for your business.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.820
However, sometimes even the numbers
can be worthless, if you can't really

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.350
explain why certain metrics are moving,
or why things are happening.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.110
This is when you want to hear
from your users to get some

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.714
qualitative answers and reasons.

00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:25.450
UserTesting.com is a tool that can
give you a wealth of information and

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.870
insights into what users are feeling
when they use your product.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.430
Let's hear from Mike, VP of [INAUDIBLE]
UserTesting.com about UserTesting.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.600
&gt;&gt; So, why do you want to see
people actually using your app?

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.060
Analytics can tell you wonderful things,
and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.840
it's really important to have the best
analytics you can possible get.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.900
But what they tell you is,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.050
what people are doing and
you don't necessarily learn why.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.180
So you may see a problem but
you don't understand why it's happening.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.850
And then you end up learning a whole
bunch of different experiments to try to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.650
figure out what's going on.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.160
And they won't necessarily get you
really quickly to the right answer.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.290
Where as if you can combine
the analytics that tell you what people

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.740
are doing with the video that tells
you why and what they're thinking and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.510
stuff like that, you can much more
quickly get really, really good overall

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.370
insight that kind of combine both
qualitative and quantitative measures.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.360
So it's a way to learn faster.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.830
So one example of this sorts of
things that people learn from testing

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.290
the listings for
the store is even the art style

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.970
of the icons can be really,
really important.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.011
So it's not just what you show, but
it's are you doing for instance,

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:37.163
a cartoony-type version of the icon,
in which case,

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:39.991
that kind of suggests
a certain type of audience.

00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:43.711
And sometimes you'll find I don't
want to be sexist about this at all, but

00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:47.491
sometimes what we see is the women
sometimes respond better to something so

00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.985
little more cartoon looking because
it feels a little bit more friendly.

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:54.626
Think of the sort of graphics that you
see in a game like Candy Crush which is

00:01:54.626 --> 00:01:55.821
really aimed at women.

00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:59.796
Then sometimes you get more hard-edged
graphics that with the little more

00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:04.024
realistic looking and maybe you've got
if you got face frowning face that looks

00:02:04.024 --> 00:02:06.630
aggressive or something like that.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.729
Sometimes again, it sounds sexist, but
the guys respond better to that sort of

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.790
thing and so it's not just what you
show but it's also how you present it.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.120
The graphical style that you use,
the artistic style,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.020
all that sort of stuff you need be very,
very conscious of.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.180
Combining analytics and
user tests is one of the best things,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.790
one of the most fun
things that you can do.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.680
Because the analytics will give you all
sorts of information on what's happening

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.730
with your application.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.220
And you'll inevitably identify some
places where people are getting stuck.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.630
Oh they get to the third panel and

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.610
they cant figure out what their,
why are they not clicking on the button?

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.090
It's so
freaking obvious to the design team.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.120
Right, because we worked on it for
nine months now and

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.850
so it's completely intuitive to us.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.040
They're not tapping on
that same thing and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.980
you'll get disputes within
the team sometimes.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.470
Religious disputes about well,
it's the color.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.860
No, no, no, it's the design of the icon.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.890
And you could go and run like 15
different AB tests to try to figure out

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.540
all that stuff, and
spend an enormous amount of time.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.380
And what we recommend is
instead we reach that point.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.270
One of your user tests and
it doesn't have to be 50, okay.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.670
You're not looking for
quantitative stuff, this is qualitative,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.760
it could be, maybe five.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.200
Just to get some reactions from people,
give them instructions,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.670
go to the screen and then tell me
what you're going to do next and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.020
talk to me about what you're thinking.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.472
So don't just watch what they do but
you can prompt them with,

00:03:27.472 --> 00:03:30.125
I want you to tell me when you look
at the screen what are you seeing.

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:33.015
And what do you choose to do next?

00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:34.607
Why do you choose to do that?

00:03:34.607 --> 00:03:38.778
And usually what you'll find is they're
getting confused or their getting

00:03:38.778 --> 00:03:43.014
distracted by something and half the
time it'll be what somebody was arguing

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:47.201
within the team and half the time it'll
be something that nobody realized.

00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:50.522
Like oh my,
oh my goodness that annoyed them, or

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:55.791
that made them feel like they weren't
well connected to it and [SOUND], okay.

00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:58.340
But the good news is that
you found out quickly.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.890
So you can then for
your AB test that's going to follow,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.620
you're B version can be affixed
to that particular problem.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.750
And so with luck maybe he'll only have
to do one AB test or maybe you'll only

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.090
have to do a couple of rounds in order
to get it to really really work better.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.450
So what it does it is makes your
analytics in your AB testing

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.339
more effective it let's you move
through that stuff faster.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:24.360
So you evolve the app faster,
you get better quicker and therefore,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.560
you are able to reach your
ramp point a lot faster.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.550
So other things you can do with
user tests, the cool thing is

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.400
you're not just limited to
recording what's on the screen and

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.570
get the end users voice, you can
also turn on the backside camera.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.390
So something that we've done for
some developers is

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.080
If you've designed an app where you want
it to be taken out into the real world

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.810
you can get some context about how
it's being used in those places.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.930
To give you an example we did some stuff
for one of the major real estate apps

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.250
and they assumed that the app
was going to be used at for

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.060
home browsing when they're at
people are out looking at homes.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.540
And what they found instead was that
people were using it at home on

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.890
the couch to plan out
where they wanted to go.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.000
And so, all of a sudden,
you realize the context of the usage

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.650
of the application is different, so
I'm competing with the television.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.800
I'm competing with stuff that's
playing on the stereo, but

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.830
that also means different ways you can
potentially market to those people.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.810
If they're using it at home
while they're watching TV,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.140
oh, what shows do our
target users go after.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.320
Are there some ways we could look for
placement, or things like that,

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.220
and obviously, if you're a small start
up maybe you don't have the money to

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.390
look at those sorts of things, but you
can still look rather than advertising.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.720
Maybe it's placement opportunities or
how do I influence the people

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.580
that I know that they're watching or
things like that.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.430
So the more context you can get
around the life of your user in

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.330
the situation in which
your stuff is being used.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.290
The better you're going to be able to

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.100
be able to tailor your stuff exactly
to what those people are going to want.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.860
I think another thing is, you can use
it also just to kind of interview them.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.580
So obviously, you should be talking
to your customers all the time,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.900
you should be meeting with them.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.950
You should be taking them out
to coffee or doing whatever.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.560
But there may be situations where
they're geographically diverse and

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.830
you want to see what are people
thinking in other areas.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.740
You can do a user test that just asks
them questions and asks them to talk.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.190
You don't have to have
them using your software.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.970
It can just be a way to record
a quick interview with these people.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.870
Think of it as focus groups,
where you don't have to rent a focus

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.590
group facility, you don't have to
schedule these people to come in,

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.920
you don't have to pay them a whole
bunch of money to come in.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.007
And then by the way, half of them don't
show up and you sit there eating m and

00:06:32.007 --> 00:06:34.940
m's while you're waiting for
somebody to come out.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.410
It can be a way to just get some
dialogue going with your users and

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.510
get them talking to you
about what they're thinking.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:46.010
So one more interesting use of these
sorts of user tests to be aware of

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.080
is that the videos themselves
can be very, very persuasive.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.890
So, you may be in a situation as
a marketing person where you've gotten

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.530
an insight about how
the customers think, but

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.510
maybe other people in the company
have their own ideas.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.644
And you can do the traditional thing,
which is you go have a big long argument

00:07:02.644 --> 00:07:06.389
with them over a whole bunch of
different times to gradually move them

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:09.633
over, or what you can do is
just forward the videos around.

00:07:09.633 --> 00:07:12.848
And in fact, one small developer
I was talking with the other day,

00:07:12.848 --> 00:07:16.641
they're a company called Trove, that
does personal property management for

00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:19.184
kind of like insurance purposes and
stuff like that.

00:07:19.184 --> 00:07:23.575
And so they've got like a 15 or
20 person staff, and they said, well,

00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:26.922
we get together and
we do viewing parties in the videos and

00:07:26.922 --> 00:07:32.070
sometimes they're great because they
confirm things that we already thought.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.690
And sometimes they're really,
really painful, but the nice thing is,

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.360
nobody argues with a use who's
saying what they actually think.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.994
And you know that these tests are being
really effective when you get other

00:07:43.994 --> 00:07:47.626
members of the team, like engineers or
people like that, coming back and

00:07:47.626 --> 00:07:51.610
saying, I saw this in the video, and I'm
starting to think this is the direction

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.619
we should go, because then
you're just educating people.

00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:57.498
You're not having to argue,
you're not having to create friction.

00:07:57.498 --> 00:07:59.438
It's not taking a long time,
but naturally,

00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:02.130
the team's coming together
around these insights.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.080
And to me that's one of
the best uses of these tests.
