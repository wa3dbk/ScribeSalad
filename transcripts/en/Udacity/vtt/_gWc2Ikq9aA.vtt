00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.980
This is just a fun quiz to get you thinking

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.520
about latency and throughput. I am sure that most of

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.920
you would have gotten that, the time to get to

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.580
the classroom, after all, from my office is one minute,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.730
so that's the latency I'm going to observe, getting to my

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.130
classroom. The interesting thing is the throughput. The throughput is

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.830
five per minute, because the hallway is wide enough. For

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.940
five of us to walk side by side, so the throughput

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.930
that we can get is five per minute. The important

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.479
thing I want you to see is that, the latency

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.580
is not the inverse of throughput. On other words, if

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.940
tomorrow I widen the hallway to make 10 people walk

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.530
side by side to get to the classroom from my

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.150
office, that's going to increase the throughput, but it does nothing

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.970
to the latency, the latency is always going to be the

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.780
time it takes for me to get from my office,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.960
to the classroom.
