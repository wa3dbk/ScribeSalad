00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.600
Mutual authentication
protocol takes five steps.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.200
Can we simplify it?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.090
That is, can we use fewer steps?

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.330
It seems that the following would work.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.160
First, Alice says hi to Bob and
sends along a challenge R2.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.890
Second, in response,
Bob sends Alice the ciphertext of R2,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.660
and his own challenge R1.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.740
Upon receiving this response,
Alice decrypts the ciphertext

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.360
to see if it matches the plain text,
R2, that she has sent to Bob.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.310
If it matches, then she knows that
she's communicating with Bob.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.210
Third, Alice then sends
Bob the ciphertext of R1.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.370
And Bob decrypts it and
matches it with the plain text, R1,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.320
to authenticate Alice.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.080
Is there anything wrong with
this simplified protocol?

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.540
It turns out that there
is a reflection attack,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.300
a kind of man in the middle attacks.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.790
Here's how it works.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.709
First, Trudy impersonates Alice.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.830
By following the protocol,
Trudy will be stuck at step three

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.380
because she can not encrypt
the challenge, R1, sent from Bob.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.160
She does not have the key KAB.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.290
Then Trudy simply opens another
connection with Bob and, again,

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.140
impersonating Alice.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.410
This time Trudy sends Bob the challenge,
R1,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.380
that Bob has sent her in the first
connection, the one that she stuck in.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.814
According to the protocol,
Bob responds with a ciphertext of R1 and

00:01:34.814 --> 00:01:37.210
another challenge, R3.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.710
Notice that Bob has send
the ciphertext of R1 to Alice.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.630
So what Trudy can do is to
take this ciphertext of R1.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.980
Then Trudy can now go back to the step
three of the first connection and

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.560
send it back to Bob to
complete the first connection.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.280
That is, at this point, the first
connection successfully concludes, and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.830
Trudy has successfully
impersonated Alice.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.480
This is called a reflection
attack because Trudy simply

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.360
sends back to Bob what Bob had just
sent her from another connection.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.950
So how can we prevent
reflection attacks?

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.730
One way is to use two
different share keys.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.680
One is for the initiator of
the connection, say Alice, and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.080
the other is for the responder, say Bob.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.569
The result is that the ciphertext
that Trudy gets from Bob can not be

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.142
presented as a ciphertext from
Alice because these two ciphertexts

00:02:35.142 --> 00:02:37.647
should be using two different keys.

00:02:37.647 --> 00:02:41.280
That is,
there are two share keys being used.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.057
Say Alice used KAB1 and Bob used KAB2.

00:02:45.057 --> 00:02:51.027
Therefore the ciphertext from
Bob is encrypted using KAB2,

00:02:51.027 --> 00:02:56.780
and Bob is going to expect
a ciphertext using KAB1.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.106
Therefore, even though Trudy
can accept the ciphertext, but

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:04.880
this Cipher text is produced using KAB2.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.510
She cannot simply send
it back to Bob because

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.660
the ciphertext sent to Bob
must be encrypted using KAB1.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.440
Another way to prevent
the reflection attack

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.180
is to use different challenges for
the initiator and the responder.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.030
For example, we can use an even
number challenge for Alice and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.196
odd number for Bob.

00:03:26.196 --> 00:03:30.020
Therefore, when Trudy
receives a challenge, R1,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.910
from Bob the challenge is an odd number,
and Trudy cannot use.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.270
This is a new challenge for Bob because
Bob is expecting an even number.
