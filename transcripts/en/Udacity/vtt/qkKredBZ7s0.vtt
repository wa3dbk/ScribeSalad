We think it's incredibly important that
you get feedback on your code as you

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.690
write it, so we created the Udacity
Front End Feedback Chrome extension

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.570
to give you feedback on quizzes
as you work on your own computer.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.330
To set it up, visit the Chrome
web store and search for

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.590
the Udacity feedback extension.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.700
There is also a link to it below.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.810
Once you've found it,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.240
download the extension to add
it to your Chrome browser.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.710
Next, you'll want to edit
the settings for the extension

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.180
by right clicking the extension icon and
selecting manage extensions.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.000
Make sure the extension is enabled and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.970
that you've checked the setting
to allow access to file URLs.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.780
If you don't select this option then
you won't be able to immediately use

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.630
the extension locally.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.310
Once you've configured the extension,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.180
simply open up a quiz
that uses the extension.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.830
If you don't see tests loaded in the top
right hand corner of your browser,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.950
click the extension icon and
select allow feedback on this domain.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.180
If the tests don't pop up after that,
then try refreshing the quiz.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.240
And that's it.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.000
If you followed these steps, then
you're now ready to get started with

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.310
the Udacity Front End
Feedback Chrome extension.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.810
Good luck.
