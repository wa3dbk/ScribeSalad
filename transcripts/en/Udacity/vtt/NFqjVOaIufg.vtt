00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.374
Now one last technique that we will discuss that can be helpful in reducing

00:00:04.374 --> 00:00:08.466
stress and in turn have positive effects on physical and psychological health

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:14.844
is meditation. Meditation involves the practice of sitting quietly and clearing

00:00:14.844 --> 00:00:19.900
one's mind by concentrating on the present moment. Now this may sound easy to

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.317
do but it's actually quite difficult. Mindfulness is one technique for focusing

00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:30.286
on present. That is, being in the moment. So, mindfulness meditation is the act

00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:35.077
of meditating while being aware of the present moment. And in the present

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:39.301
moment, concentrating only on breathing or in some cases, you may concentrate

00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:44.660
on a particular saying or thought. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.684
have a positive effect on both physiological and psychological well being. For

00:00:49.684 --> 00:00:54.836
example, reducing pain, depression and anxiety. Therefore, mindfulness

00:00:54.836 --> 00:00:58.928
meditation is an important technique or tool that can be used to combat the

00:00:58.928 --> 00:01:04.134
negative reactions to stress. I encourage you to go to YouTube and look up some

00:01:04.134 --> 00:01:08.985
mindfulness meditation practices and then try them. And incorporate these into

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:12.569
your daily activities so you can have a powerful tool for combating negative

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.460
psychological and physiological effects of stress.
