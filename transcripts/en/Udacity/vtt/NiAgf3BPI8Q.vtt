00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.820
Here's a simple Android app using
street view to show a scene.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.630
As I move my finger around the display,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.250
you can see that I can
look around this location.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.870
As I touch the arrows, you can see
that I can walk along the trail.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.370
Similarly, if I touch in the far
distance, I can jump to that location.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.670
This location is a hiking
trail in the Grand Canyon.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.219
And as you can see, street view
isn't limited to just streets.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.060
As I touch in the direction of the hike,
I simply follow the path.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.750
This one actually goes all the way down
to the bottom of the Grand Canyon.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.600
This virtual hike down
the Grand Canyon was built

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.950
using only a few lines of code.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.950
Let's take a look at how to
build this for ourselves.
