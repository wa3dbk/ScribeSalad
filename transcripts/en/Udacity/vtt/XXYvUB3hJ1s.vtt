00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's start here--palace minus walk.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is a lot like 5 minus 3 if "palace" and "walk" are identifiers.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Here the parentheses are balanced. We like this utterance.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Here we start a bold tag and right "naguib," but we never close off the bold tag.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is not balanced.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Here we start an italics tag and write "mahfouz," and then we close off the italics tag.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is well-balanced.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Here we write open "pulitzer" plus open "prize" close close--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
open parenthesis, open parenthesis, close, close.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This one matches there. This one matches there. These are well-balanced.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You might think there's no reason to put "prize" in parentheses,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and you might not if you were writing, but the grammar--the language--

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
allows it as long as the parentheses are balanced.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Over here this one is particularly tricky.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We have a close parenthesis followed by "1956" followed by an open parenthesis.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now, the number of open and close parentheses is the same,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
so you might think it's balanced, but they're in the wrong order.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We need to do the opening before the closing. This does not match.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
"Naguib Mahfouz" is a relatively famous Egyptian writer.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
He wrote Palace Walk. It's set in about 1917 around the end of World War I in Egypt in Cairo.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It details what goes on with Al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad and his family.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
My best attempt at doodling Egypt or Cairo is someone next to a pyramid.

00:01:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You can tell it's a pyramid because it's clearly labeled.
