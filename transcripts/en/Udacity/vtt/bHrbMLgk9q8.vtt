The function f of x equals log based 10 of x can only have inputs that are

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.940
positive. If we substitute in x equals negative 4, we'll find ourselves trying

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:18.180
to take here the log of negative 20, or here the log of negative 5. We take

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.020
here log base 10 of negative 20 and add to that log base 10 of negative 5. And

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.825
yes, we get an error, just as we suspected. This isn't allowed because negative

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:35.850
20 and negative five aren't part of the domain of this function. That means

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.900
that x equals negative 4 is not a solution. Nothing goes wrong though for x

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.710
equals 5. We get perfectly valid values when we plug in five in the spot of X

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.753
here. That means that only X equals five is a solution.
