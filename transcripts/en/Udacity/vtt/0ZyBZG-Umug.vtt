00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.580
All right. So let's say that we look at our data

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.210
and it's clearly non-normal. Or we use a statistical test like

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.710
the Shapiro–Wilk test and find that our data's non-normal that way.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.170
Is there anything that we can do? Well, first off there's

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.380
some math that says that we have enough data. That we

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.040
have, you know, a large enough sample size we can actually

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.440
use tests that assume normality. For example, the t test. Even

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.750
when our data is not normal. But there also exists nonparametric tests

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.195
that we can use to compare two samples. A

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:31.480
non-parametric test is a statistical test that does not assume

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.820
our data is drawn from any particular underlying probability distribution.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.020
One such test is the Mann-Whitney U Test which is

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.370
also sometimes referred to as the Mann-Whitney Wilcoxan Test.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.820
This is a test of the null hypothesis that two

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.370
populations are the same. Again I don't want to go to

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.980
in depth into the theory of how this test works,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.330
but I did want to tell you that things

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.340
like this exist and show you that this test

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.970
can also easily be implemented in Python using Psi

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.310
Pi. We'd simply say U and P are equal

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.660
to scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu. And provides as arguments are two samples

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.224
which we'll call here X and Y. This function

00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:14.220
will return U, the Mann-Whitney test statistic. As well

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.110
as P, which is the one sided P value

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.920
for this test. The P value here again acts as

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.780
it did for the T test. Note that the Mann-Whitney

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.040
U test simply tests whether or not these samples came

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.940
from the same population. But not necessarily which one has

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.250
a higher mean or a higher median or anything like

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.180
that. Because of this it's usually useful to report Mann-Whitney

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.450
U test results along with some other information. Like, the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.630
two sample means, or the sample medians, or something like that.
