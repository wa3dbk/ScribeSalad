00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.930
So let's look at the problem of aliasing
in the virtual index physical tag

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:04.830
caches.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.490
This is a virtual address.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.440
And the way we access the cache is
these are the offset bits, this will

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.050
be our index bits, and this will be the
tag if we use this to access the cache.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.890
In a virtual index cache,
we use the index part of the address.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.710
From the virtual address, the rest
comes from the physical address.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.490
But how do we form the physical address?

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.180
Well some lower bits of the virtual
address will be the page offset.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.940
The rest will be the page number.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.840
And now remember that the page
number gets translated

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.700
to become the frame number
in the physical address.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.550
While the page offs just goes and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.150
becomes the least significant
base of the physically address.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.580
And in a virtually indexed, physically
tagged cache, our tag comes from here,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.780
but our index came from from here, so
that we could begin the access quickly.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.730
The thing to note is that the index
bits are relatively close to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.710
the least significant bit
of the virtual address, and

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.420
that the page offset
has a number of bits.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.330
So for a small cache it can happen

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.310
that the index bits that we use
all come from the page offset,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.620
which means they are the same as if we
took them from the physical address.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.890
So, although we are indexing
using the virtual address,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.440
in reality, we are actually using
the same index that we would be using

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.380
if we were using the physical address.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.930
Which means, there will be no aliasing.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.750
How is there no aliasing?

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.194
Well, because the virtual pages, that
have different page numbers that map to

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:38.707
the same frame number,
can only differ in the page number, but

00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:42.250
they have to have the same offsets for
the same data.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.370
And because only the offset matters for

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.040
the index if the index
is low enough here.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.480
What happens here is, pretty much,
all of the data that can possibly

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.830
be in the same place in the physical
memory has to be in the same set,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.760
because the index is determined only
from the part that has to be the same.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.030
So we have that there is no aliasing

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.919
if all of the index bits that we
use came from the page offset.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.850
Because really those are the same
index bits that would

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.170
come from the physical address if
we had the physical index cache.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.760
We like this very much, but the cache
has to be small enough to do this.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.580
So for example, if we have a 4 kilobyte
page, we will have a 12-bit page offset.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.750
If our cache is a 32 byte block,
it has a 5-bit block offset here.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.240
That means that the index,
which still needs to fit in the 12

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.370
bits of the page offset,
can only have 7 bits, so

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.520
we can only have 128 sets in this cache,
which limits its size.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.760
If we have more sets than this,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.310
then some of the index bits
here come from the page number.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.190
And that changes when we have
the frame number, so it can easily be

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.470
that the different these bits here end
up mapping to the same frame number,

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.200
which we don't want because that
means that multiple sets in the cache

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.370
could have the same actual data, which
is bad because we cannot find it then.
