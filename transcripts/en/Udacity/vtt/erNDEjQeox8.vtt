00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.839
Our first investors,

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:06.617
I don't know if it's the first investor
because we had a few on day 1.

00:00:06.617 --> 00:00:11.400
They were the best possible fit for us.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.410
They shared the same culture as us,
the same beliefs.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.360
The same approach of
starting a business.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.670
They gave us their full support.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.870
They really believed in the team.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.200
Some believed in the CDO
more than in the CEO.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.390
Some believed in the CEO
more than the CDO.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.880
But they were there for us.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.720
And working with them was an experience
that I will never forget.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.020
And I owed him so much like Michael is,
I owed him to my first investors.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.120
They validate your vision and
they say okay, you are not crazy.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.928
We believe that you can lead a team
to execute on this crazy vision.

00:00:58.928 --> 00:01:03.838
And when people that you appreciate say
something like that and actually put

00:01:03.838 --> 00:01:09.128
their money where their mouth is, it's
something very special, something very

00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:14.210
special happens when when they do it for
some people, for most people even if.
