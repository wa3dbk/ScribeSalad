00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.780
Earlier we had this formula for calculating the Euclidean distance in two

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.380
dimensions. Now we can generalize it to many dimensions. So

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.960
here is a generalization of the previous formula computing nearest neighbor.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.780
In this new formula, both the case and the problem are defined in K dimensions.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.100
And we'll find the Euclidean distance between them in this K space. So

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.065
this table summarizes Euclidean distance between the cases and the new problem

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:29.390
in this multidimensional space where we are dealing both with the origin and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.470
the destination, and where the origin as well as the destination are specified

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.570
by the x and y coordinates. Looking at this table, we can very quickly see that

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.670
D and not B or E, is the closest case, your most similar case, linear problem Q.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.290
This method is called the KNN method where NN stands here for nearest neighbor,

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.720
K nearest neighbor method. This is a probably method as simple as it is.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.980
Of course, it also has limitations. One limitations is that, in the real world,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.620
the number of dimensions in which I might want to compute the distance between

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.593
the new problem and old cases might be very large, a high dimensional low space.

00:01:09.593 --> 00:01:14.700
In such a situation, deciding which of the stored cases is closest to the new

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.270
problem may not be as simple as it appears here. A second difficulty with this

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.750
method is, that even if the new problem isn't very close to an existing case,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.250
that does not mean that the existing cases solution can or

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.880
should be darkly applied to the new problem.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.140
So, we need both alternative methods of retrieving cases from memory, and

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.036
methods for adapting passed cases to fit the requirements of the new problem.

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:44.150
That is called [UNKNOWN] and we will discuss that in the next lesson.
