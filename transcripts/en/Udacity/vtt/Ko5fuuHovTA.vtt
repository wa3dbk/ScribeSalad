00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.118
You've had some practice expanding logarithmic expressions, so now let's try

00:00:04.118 --> 00:00:09.794
one that has a natural log. Here I have ln of the square root of 4x minus 6

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:15.046
over 3. Now, eventually, we can try expanding this using the quotient property,

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:18.518
but first, all I'd like us to do, is just rewrite the numerator here using an

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:22.279
exponent instead of the radical sign.
