00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.948
Alright, let's do it together. The algorithm started out by assuming that the

00:00:04.948 --> 00:00:09.191
tallest one is the one at position zero. Now, we want to visit all other

00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:13.107
elements. For that, we can't really use the enhanced for loop, that would visit

00:00:13.107 --> 00:00:16.617
all elements including the one at zero, which we no longer care about, so we'll

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:21.935
use a regular for loop. Here's the loop. Notice that i starts at one, and not

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:25.908
at zero, because we no longer want to look at the element at index zero. With

00:00:25.908 --> 00:00:29.968
this loop, we only look to the index values, and we still need to get the

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:35.880
element at that value. Now we're ready to compare the current one against the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.169
tallest one. That comparison is here. In that case, we change our mind, and say

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:45.514
the tallest one is no pic. When you run the code the tallest one will be

00:00:45.514 --> 00:00:50.150
displayed, and it's this one. Let's move on to another algorithm.
