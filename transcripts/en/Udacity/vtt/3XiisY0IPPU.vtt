00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.576
And, I hope no one panic. You could start coding if you're real confident. What

00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:06.366
I think you really should do at this point is work out some examples. Just to

00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:09.249
understand the Inputs and Outputs is not enough. We need to understand the

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:12.116
relationship between the two and the best way to do that is to work out some

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:16.077
examples. And, these are also going to give us some test cases to use to know if

00:00:16.077 --> 00:00:18.459
our program is correct. So, that's what we'll do next.
