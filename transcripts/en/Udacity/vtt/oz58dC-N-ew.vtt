00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.900
Hadoop runs on Java so
you'll need to install it now.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.528
For this, you'll use OpenJDK,
an open source version of Java.

00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:11.262
I'm going to type in a bunch of commands
now, but I'll make them available to you

00:00:11.262 --> 00:00:14.158
so you can copy and paste instead
of trying to memorize them.

00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:17.688
The first thing to do is update and
upgrade Linux packages.

00:00:17.688 --> 00:00:20.028
It's just good practice in general.

00:00:20.028 --> 00:00:23.930
This can take a bit, so,
it's a good time to make a cup of tea.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.999
Once that's done, install OpenJDK.

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.192
What you'll do is download a hadoop
release, then extract it and

00:00:32.192 --> 00:00:33.651
move it to user local.

00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:38.008
First download the hadoop
archive with wget.

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:42.760
It'll probably take a bit to download,
but your tea should be at

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.610
nice drinking temperature by now,
so take some time to enjoy it.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.090
Here, 2.7.2 is the version
of the release that

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.230
I downloaded when I recorded this.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.210
However, you're probably
watching this from the future.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.100
It's likely best to use the most
recent version in your time, so

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.355
you should download that one instead.

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:01.613
You also want to download it
from a mirror close to you.

00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:04.647
I'll give you a link to a list of
mirrors where you can find one.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:08.738
With that downloaded,
you can now extract it to user local.

00:01:08.738 --> 00:01:11.450
It puts everything in a directory
with a version number.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.470
Let's get rid of the number.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.788
Rename the directory to just hadoop.

00:01:13.788 --> 00:01:15.619
