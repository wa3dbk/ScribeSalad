00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To summarize the correlation coefficient, which you're just about to learn about,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is a value between -1 and 1, tells us how related or correlated two variables are

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and both 1 and -1 stand for perfectly linear data.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In the case of +1, we know that this line increases in x and y simultaneously

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
whereas for -1, we have the inverse effect.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's compute r--my favorite way to compute it is very similar

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to the way we computed b in linear regression.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It looks like the sum of all data points and takes the product of (xi-x-bar)

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and multiplies for each data point this with (yi - y-bar) and then, we have to normalize.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This could be any value. It isn't between ±1.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We normalize by a √(x-x-bar)² sum of all i's times the same expression for y.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now this looks a little bit wild, and this is probably the worst formula

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
you've encountered in this class in terms of complexity but once you dived in,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
you'll realize this is really related to a lot of stuff you've seen before such as variances and similar.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is the quintessential term that occurs in the variance calculation of x.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
All that's missing is the normalizer.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Same over here, this is the variance of y--this thing is the normalizer.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We take the product of the variance of x and the variance of y  modally with the normalizers

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and we get something quadratic even in variance space.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This over here is kind of a mixed variance. This is often called the covariance.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But notice that there is also a normalizer in this thing over here.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In fact, the missing normalizers on top and bottom of this bar

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
can't see each other out; hence, I just omitted them.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But this one is just like the variance calculation but it mixes x's and y's whereas these are x² and y².

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is called often covariance if you've normalized, because

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
it is the variance calculation of a two co-occuring variables.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
These are the variances.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So what this really tells you is kind of the ratio how much these two things co-evolve,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
how much the errors correspond versus normalized by the multitudes of errors individually

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and whether the ratio becomes 1, we have a perfect correlation.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
When the ratio becomes 0, then the numerator is 0 which means our errors cancel each other out.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
That is very different for x and for y under any linear model.

00:02:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So this complicated formula is what's called the correlation coefficient r. So let's try this out.
