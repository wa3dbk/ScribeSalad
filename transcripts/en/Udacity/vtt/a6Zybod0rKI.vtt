00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.730
So, in the 1950s and 60s, British psychologist by the name of John Bowlby

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:10.430
developed a theory called attachment. And this was based on two observations.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.936
The first observation was made by the animal behaviorist Konrad Lorenz. And

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:20.651
Lorenz had seen in baby geese that whoever cared for them became their mother.

00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:23.518
it's not all that weird until you realize that the mother could be a human,

00:00:23.518 --> 00:00:27.845
didn't have to be a goose. And this is what he called imprinting. The second

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:33.372
observation was made by Sigmund Freud. And Freud had observed that when mothers

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:39.571
go away from babies that the baby becomes really distressed, really upset. And

00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:44.601
this, he called separation anxiety. So, it was imprinting on the one hand and

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:48.249
separation anxiety on the other hand that led John Bowlby to develop a theory

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:53.596
for why attachment to the caregiver is. So important in early stages of human

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:54.710
development.
