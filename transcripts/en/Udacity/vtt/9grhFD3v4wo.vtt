It looks to me like the slope of these opposite sides is the same. Slope,

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:08.460
however, as we'll soon talk about, has to do with how the change in y and the

00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:12.766
change in x are related. Any two lines that have the same slope are parallel.

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:17.173
They will never touch one another. They'll always just be the same distance

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:18.999
apart along their entire length.
