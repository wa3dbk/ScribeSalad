00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.200
Okay so where's the parallelism?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.320
So one problem is F and this while loop.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.790
Notice that we pull out vertices and
we put vertices back in.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.340
The vertex that we just put in depends
on the vertex that we pulled out.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.916
So that appears to create a sequential
bottle neck and since they while loop

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:23.170
executes O of V times, then the span
would appear to be O of V, as well.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.810
This makes the average available
parallelism, essentially,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.450
a constant plus
the ratio E divided by V.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.540
So, is that good or bad?

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.120
In real life, graphs are sparse, and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.010
so what that means, is that we should
expect the size of E to be O of V.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.770
That means the average available
parallelism will be a constant and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.920
that's definitely bad.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.750
So this concept of sparsity
is a fact of life.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.190
Think about a social network.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.220
The vast majority of people will
have some maximum number of friends.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.240
Let's say, I don't know 1000,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.140
independent of how many
people are in the network.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.340
Or imagine a worse case,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.940
which might be a linear graph
that's shown on the right.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.940
This might represent, oh, I don't know,
a bunch of hermaphroditic anti-social

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.760
worms who only associate with
their immediate offspring.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.920
Anyway, since sparsity's a fact of life,
we're going to have to live with it and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.250
therefore the sequential
algorithm is bad.
