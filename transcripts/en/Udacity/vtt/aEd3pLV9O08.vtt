00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's look at some tradeoffs in random testing, and what I really mean here is

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
advantages and disadvantages of random testing that might lead you to spend

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
more or less time doing it and so on this side I'm going to put advantages.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Over here, I'm going to put some disadvantages.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
One of the main disadvantages of random testing is of course this something you spend

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
a lot of time already dealing with is that the input validity problem can be really hard,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and a lot of people would give up on random testing.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In my opinion, give up on it too early before they've gotten good results

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and often it's this input validity problem that stops them.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The fact is there might be some creativity required to get around this.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
For example, mutating existing inputs or getting a good enough understanding of the structure

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of the input that we can actually generate valid or random inputs from oracle.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Oracles are hard too--so again, we need a substantial amount

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of creativity to deal with the lack of oracles.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
One of the people often like when doing testing is they like to have a fix test suite,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and they like to run it and they like to know when it's done,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but if they didn't get any failures, they can feel good.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Random testing on the other hand has no stopping criterion,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and so for example, if you run a random tester on eight course for a day without finding any problems

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that implies nothing about what you'll find in the future.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You might find six or seven problems in the next hour of testing,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and in the process of doing this compiler testing that I've been doing for several years now,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I found this to really be the case.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I can start a compiler testing run. For example the weight exertion of GCC and all of them.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I won't find anything for a long time, and I think to myself--

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
gee, they've really sort of nailed the issues and then just as the probability is working out, how they do,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a bunch of problems will come out after a day or two.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So another problem and this one we haven't really talked about yet

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is that random testing may find unimportant bugs

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and what I mean by this is that since random testing explores parts of the input demand

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
they may not be often explored by real users of the system.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It could be that the people developing this software under test

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
are not remotely interested in fixing the bugs that are triggered by the strange inputs

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and this can be frustrating, but it is really just very situational.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Some kind of bugs such as buffer overflows in a web server or in a pdf reader or something like that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
almost mandatory to fix because they are so often exploitable.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So those kind of bugs really can't be labeled unimportant by right thinking developers

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
On the other hand, if we're talking about problems that really might not come up in practice

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
so let's say that with my C compiler testing, I generate a C function

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that's 100,000 lines long and this fails to compile.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Well, the compiler developers all and certainly going to ignore me

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
because people just don't like code like that,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and similarly, if I make an identifier let's just say a variable name

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that's 800 characters long and that crushes the compiler and they may not care about that either.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and so the general flavor of the solution to this problem is first of all to generate random inputs

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that are more like inputs of interest.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So for example, when we're generating random C-codes, we don't make really long functions,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
we don't make really long identifier names, we don't nest parenthesis really deeply,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and it could easily be of these things would find bugs, but we just don't really have

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
any confidence that if we find these bugs that anybody would care about fixing them

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
so we'd rather just not even find them.
