00:01:06.175 --> 00:01:12.910
&gt;&gt; Okay. And it points out a choice that you have as a specifier here.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:20.300
We could if we were given a a vector of length three and a vector of length 10,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.580
say no they, they don't have the same elements and remember by same elements as,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.270
we're talking about the same number of occurrence as. Or,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.290
we could treat it as a pre-condition, okay? And say that the lengths must be

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.810
the same in order for us even to apply same elements as, as a function, and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.030
that's the choice that we're going to, we're going to make here. Okay, so

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.010
remember that the vertical line is used for cardinality or

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.420
length. And the cardinality of x must be equal to the cardinality of y.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.330
Now we're talking here about first order logic. We're not talking about

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.140
a programming language. So equals means equal. It doesn't mean a sign to or

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.470
anything else. We don't have to worry about anything like the C or

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.390
Java where we'd have to use two equals, symbols in order to designate equality.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.180
So we're just going to say that the length of x equals the length of y,

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.630
and that's the precondition for, same elements as. Now, going back to

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.950
when we first asked the question to state in, in English, what it means

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.880
for the output to be the assorted version of the input, we said things like each

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.670
element in x must be found in y, each element of y must be found in x, and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.400
the number of occurrences the elements in x must be the same as the number of

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.220
occurrences the elements in y. And we could take that and we could

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.740
go through the stage of writing out each of those parts in first order logic.
