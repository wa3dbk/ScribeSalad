00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.200
To help us understand filtering a little bit let's actually not just look at

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.890
box filters.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.840
And here, I'm going to actually use a Gaussian filter.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.689
A Gaussian filter,

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.220
based on the equation of a Gaussian, it can be used to generate a kernel.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.030
Now in this case, the kernel in this is, is still 21 by 21.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.460
But, the values are normal distribution.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.030
So you notice, more bright values or higher values here.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.640
And as I go away from the center, they get darker.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.280
In the height map we have looking at this,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.220
you will see this to be a little different.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.250
So now if we're for example notice, that there is a peak.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.020
And then there are values, in this one.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.040
Most intensity is here.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.760
Lower ones almost zero here.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.900
And now we want to actually look at this.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.700
And apply this, as a kernel to do, smoothing or filtering operations.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.220
So let's take our example again and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.460
now this time around I'll apply the Gaussian Filter.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.380
Which basically is again, shown by this 21 by 21.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.600
Look at the values that we just saw in the previous slide.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.590
And applied here, you see a result which is also smooth.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.360
But here you might be able to notice that some of the edges have

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.590
a little bit more detail.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.210
Again primarily because it's in the linear combination.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.710
It's attribute weight is it's giving more weight to the pixel,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.610
at the center and actually is giving more value to that, and less value in

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.940
the linear combination to the values that are away from the center.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.420
So as we rub it, it tries to give more values or

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.180
more, more detail at the level, where the center is.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.440
Just for comparison's sake,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.670
I'd like to show you both these results next to each other.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.480
Hopefully your video resolution is good enough for

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.690
you to see that this looks a little bit more blurrier than this one.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.860
Just for sake of completeness we're going to zoom into to see some more detail.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.320
Here is the zoom region that I've chosen.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.988
Where the stem of this pepper is the one we want to focus on.

00:01:49.988 --> 00:01:54.070
Zooming in, you will see that this one is much more blurred, and

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.830
actually just flattened out.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.810
While in this case, you'll see a little bit more of detail.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.190
Now of course, it's not very like the median filter we had looked at before.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.500
But Gaussian filter basically is just a different kernel.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.620
And you can see other details also which are completely lost
