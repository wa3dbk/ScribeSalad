00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.081
So to compute the number of steps, what we're going to do is start at the top

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:06.492
and count how many steps it gets from the top to the bottom.

00:00:06.492 --> 00:00:09.893
So here's the first step. It has 8 operations.

00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:14.464
Second step, third step, fourth step, fifth step, sixth step,

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:16.354
and then we've computed the final results.

00:00:16.354 --> 00:00:18.557
So we'd say there are 6 steps here.

00:00:18.557 --> 00:00:20.198
What's the total amount of work?

00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:22.298
Well, to do that, we count the number of operations.

00:00:22.298 --> 00:00:27.877
That's 8 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1.

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:32.017
That gives us 21 operations to compute the final answer here.

00:00:32.017 --> 00:00:34.683
When we discuss algorithms, we'll often discuss these metrics

00:00:34.683 --> 00:00:38.718
not so much in terms of numbers--the number of steps or the total amount of work--

00:00:38.718 --> 00:00:41.353
but instead as functions of the size of the input.

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:43.187
So we might have a totally different problem,

00:00:43.187 --> 00:00:45.218
and we might say that the amount of work in that problem

00:00:45.218 --> 00:00:47.692
is proportional to the size of the input squared

00:00:47.692 --> 00:00:51.808
or the number of steps in this particular problem is proportional to the size of the input.
