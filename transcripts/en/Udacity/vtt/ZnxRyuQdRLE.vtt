The first of the three sensory systems with a specific sensory cortex is the

00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:09.743
visual cortex, which is located in the occipital lobes. The second is the

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:14.704
auditory cortex, which is located in the temporal lobes. And the third is the

00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:18.799
somatosensory cortex, which is responsible for touch and is located in the

00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:24.161
parietal lobes. Our sense of smell and taste don't have their own processing

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:29.200
region. However, it's interesting to note that smell can bring forth very

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.070
strong and immediate memory. Have you, for example, noticed that particular

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.713
smells can bring back a memory for you? I can think of a few myself. For

00:00:38.713 --> 00:00:42.380
example, the smell of homemade pizza reminds me of my grandmother. The smell of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.214
the beach reminds me of the summers my family and I spent on the beach. Or, for

00:00:46.214 --> 00:00:50.049
example, maybe the smell of a perfume or cologne reminds you of an ex-lover you

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:55.530
once had. That's just an example of how smells can evoke powerful memories.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.715
Stop and think for a minute if you recall any particular smells that bring back

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:00.310
a memory to you.
