00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.520
This brings us to Branch Prediction Requirements.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.140
What do we need in order to successfully predict whether a branch is taken or

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.930
not? And where is it going if it's taken? Branch prediction needs to

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.570
work using only the knowledge of where we fetched the current instruction from.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.420
And what we needed to guess is the PC of the next instruction to fetch. So

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.590
branch predictor must correctly guess, is this a branch?

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.192
If not, then it's certainly not taken. If it is a branch, is it taken?

00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:36.900
And if it is a taken branch, what is the target PC? Where is this branch going?

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.350
These two decisions really can be boiled down to one which is.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.271
Is this a taken branch? It doesn't matter if we have a non-branch instruction,

00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:51.360
or a non-taken branch instruction. In both cases, we just fetch

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.640
the instruction that follows the branch in memory. So the only thing we

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.450
really need to decide is whether this a taken branch, or something else.
