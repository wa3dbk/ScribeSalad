Create a matching 
location entry table-creating query

00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:06.249
from the location entry contract,

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:08.747
using the weather entry one as a model.

00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:11.355
The good news is that this 
is a simpler query.

00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:15.209
And if you really hate databases, 
just move to the solution.
