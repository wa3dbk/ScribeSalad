I chose to use the CSS selector header.navbar-static-top,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:14.210
which selects the header tag with class navbar-static-top due to its simplicity.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.410
But there are a few other CSS selectors that will

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.860
correctly select the navbar element.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.390
And again, any selector that properly selects the navbar is fine, but

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.250
often you want to look for the simplest and most concise.
