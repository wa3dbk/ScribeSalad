00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.950
Are you or a loved one starting to lose your hearing? If so, you may need

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.096
DeciBoost, the affordable hearing aid. Have you ever wondered why we lose our

00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:13.524
hearing with age? Well, we hear because there are hair cells in our cochlea,

00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:17.062
our inner ear, and the smallest of these hair cells allows us to hear at the

00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:23.346
highest frequency of sounds. But with age these small hair cells are most

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:28.506
likely to be damaged, leading to hearing loss and high frequency sounds. But

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:33.780
with DesiBoost we can boost those high frequency sounds so you can hear them.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.830
Buy DesiBoost today. For our concert goers out there we created deciboost two.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.405
So, if you've been exposed regularly to sounds around 90dB, you may have early

00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:48.614
hearing loss. For example, a normal speaking voice is about 60dB. A jackhammer

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:49.230
[NOISE]

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.566
about 90dB. A very loud nightclub or concert can range [NOISE]

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.790
from 100 to 120dB. [MUSIC]

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.154
And a jet engine can reach 130 decibels. So, if you've been to a lot of loud

00:01:02.154 --> 00:01:07.306
nightclubs or rock concerts, come on in and see us or give us a call at

00:01:07.306 --> 00:01:10.465
555-HEAR.
