00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.094
Since we're subtracting two logs right here,

00:00:03.094 --> 00:00:04.451
and they have the same base,

00:00:04.451 --> 00:00:08.846
the quotient property tells us we can combine them
into one log expression,

00:00:08.846 --> 00:00:12.623
by dividing them as the input of one log.

00:00:12.623 --> 00:00:18.619
So having started out with 3 natural log of (x+4) minus the natural log of 5

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.935
we've ended up with this simpler, more compact thing--

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:26.935
natural log of (x+4) cubed, divided by 5.
