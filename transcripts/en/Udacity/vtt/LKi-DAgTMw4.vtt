00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now here we have the correct assertion.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We take the square of the square root compared with x

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and that absolute difference should be smaller than eps.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We go and tick on run and if everything works well, our test should passed by now.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
See, prints done, which means that all assertions actually now have been satisfied.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Just for the record, on my machine at this point, I can go and run a million test like this per second,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which means that assertions can be a really great test device,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
compared that to the time it would take you to write a million number of test cases,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which means that once you do have assertions, you can go and run test like crazy.
