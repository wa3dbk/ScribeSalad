00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.190
There's no denying that Swift's optional
types are both unusual and tricky.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.780
But if you're going to become
confident using Swift,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.530
it's essential that you understand
optionals inside and out.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.330
And beyond practical use, optionals
are sure to be a common target among

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.150
interview questions for iOS developers.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.130
So let's start at the very beginning.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.760
Why does Swift need this data type
that no other languages have?

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.320
The need for

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.150
optional types arises because Swift
disallows nil values in all other types.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.720
