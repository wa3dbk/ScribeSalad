When looking at the union, we can also notice that 8 is an element of E but not

00:00:04.427 --> 00:00:08.960
an element of C. When we're trying to find the union, we list any element that

00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:13.345
is in one of the sets or the other. So, 8 would be in our union. We also have

00:00:13.357 --> 00:00:17.870
this other word called intersection. The intersection is a little bit easier.

00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:23.113
It's all the elements that are in set C and in set E. We use this upside-down u

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:24.948
to denote intersection.
