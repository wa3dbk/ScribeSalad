00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.280
OpenFlow makes modifying forwarding behavior easy,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.860
because forwarding decisions are based on

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.230
matches on the openflow 10-tuple. There to switching is simply a match

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.170
on the destination Mac address which has a corresponding action of forwarding

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.810
out of particular output port. If all of the fields are specified for

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.820
forwarding out a particular output port then

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.800
we have flow switching behavior. If all

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.700
of the flow specifications are wild carded

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.060
except for say the source MAC address to

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.560
make a forwarding or drop decision Then

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.640
we have a firewall. Constructing a firewall

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.970
is as simple as building a hash table that stores key value pairs where the

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.690
table maps a switch and source MAC address to a true or false value

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.440
depending on whether traffic should be forwarded

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.260
or dropped. The controller Might then only decide

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.440
to forward traffic if the firewall entry maps to true. It is important to

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.515
emphasize the performance implications of caching the

00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:16.080
decisions at the switch. So, packets only reach

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.730
the controller if there's no flow table entry at the

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.400
switch. If on the other hand, there is a float

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.160
table entry at the switch, then the switch can simply

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.270
forward the packets rather than sending them to the controller.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.560
So when a controller decides to take an action on

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.370
a packet, it installs that action as a flow table

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.250
entry in the switch, and that decision or flow table

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.660
entry is cached until that flow table entry expires. In summary,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.060
customizing control is easy. We've explored how to

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.320
use the POX controller to develop alternate control

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.830
programs. And it's possible to turn a switch

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.340
into a firewall in less than 40 lines

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.010
of python code. We also explored the performance

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.760
benefits of caching rules and decisions, to avoid

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.720
sending too much traffic to the controller. As

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.820
we know, forwarding performance in a switch is as

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.150
fast but whenever we have to send traffic

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.250
to the controller it slows things down. So whatever

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.240
decisions we can cache in the switch will

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.010
only serve to improve the performance of the network.
