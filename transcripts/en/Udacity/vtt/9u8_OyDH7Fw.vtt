A static variable is a variable that belongs to a class but not to any object

00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:11.108
in that class. They're even less common than static methods. You're most likely

00:00:11.108 --> 00:00:17.082
to see them for constants. For example the math class defines a static variable

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:22.624
called PI. Can see it's a static, can see it's a constant because it's declared

00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:29.301
as final and it's the value of PI. If you ever need to use it, you would call

00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:34.762
it as Math.Pi. Here is another example, there is a class that defines a

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:39.920
variable called out. And again, it's static. What do you think? Which class

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.589
does this? I copied this declaration from the source code of one of the Java

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.794
classes. Tell me which one.
