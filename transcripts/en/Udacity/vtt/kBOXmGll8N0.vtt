00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.890
You just saw with Sarah that when you work on a project,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.345
you'll often have multiple files that you want to track together.

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:10.010
Git calls such a collection of files a repository.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.400
When you save a version of your files in git, in other words, when you

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.960
make a commit, you will save a version of every file in your repository.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.584
If you only have one file in your repository, for example game.js, you already

00:00:22.584 --> 00:00:26.808
know that git stores a version of your file each time you choose to commit.

00:00:26.808 --> 00:00:32.173
So if you committed changes at 1:00, 2:15, 6:09, 6:54 and

00:00:32.173 --> 00:00:35.029
8:20, then it would look like this.

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:38.030
But you might also have some other files in your repository.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.192
For example, index.html and index.css.

00:00:41.192 --> 00:00:43.950
You don't need to understand what these files are.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.780
The important thing is that all three files are connected, so

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.845
they're all required for the game to function properly.

00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:53.750
Git will also track the state of these files each time you commit.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.340
A commit is a snapshot of every file in your repository at the time you

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.280
choose to make the commit.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.080
So for example, this is the fourth commit in this repository.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.735
If you've only changed game.js in this fourth commit, then index.html and

00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:11.230
index.css will be identical between these two commits.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.820
On the other hand, you can change all the files in a single commit.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.790
For example, if you added a new button in the third commit,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.370
that would affect all three files.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.350
So if you did a diff between the second and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.070
the third commit, you would see the differences in all three.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.068
Let's take a look at how that looks.

00:01:27.068 --> 00:01:31.320
First, I'll do a git log, and I'll use the --stat option,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.500
which gives some statistics about which files have changed in each commit.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.660
So we can see all the same information here as before.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.310
But each commit also shows what files were affected in that commit.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.890
You can see that these most recent two commits only affected game.js.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.890
The green plus signs indicate additions, and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.690
the red minus signs indicate deletions.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.320
So you can see in this commit, some code was added and some code was deleted.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.460
The number of pluses and minuses is proportional to the size of the change.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.980
You don't need to worry about the units, but you can see that the second commit

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.810
is a much bigger total change than the first commit.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.800
Now, I'll scroll down a bit to try to find a commit that affects more

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.880
than one file.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.610
Here's one.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.740
You can see that this commit effected game.js, index.html, and ipad.js.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.990
Now, I'll press Q to stop viewing the git log output.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.690
And I'll go ahead and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.540
type git diff, and the two commit IDs that I want to compare.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.970
So this one, and this one.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.640
Like before, we see output in getting which file has been changed.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.480
First, game.js changed, and here's the diff for game.js.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.470
Next, we see the index.html was changed.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.812
In scrolling down, we can also see the diff for index.html.

00:02:44.812 --> 00:02:47.590
Finally, ipad.js was also changed and

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.770
we can scroll down to see the changes to that file.
