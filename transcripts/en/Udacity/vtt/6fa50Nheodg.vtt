00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.670
That's right. Only files that can be statically served can

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.080
go in the CACHE section. If the file needs to

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.530
be interpreted by the server, say, a Python script, it

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.390
really can't go in the cache section. Now, if your

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.180
application is a collection of funny cat videos, of course,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.700
you may have some of those in your application and

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.840
in the cache. But keep in mind that some implementations

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.040
have limits on the size of a single application cache.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.340
Sometimes that limit is as small as five

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.150
megabytes. So, that might not do Fluffy justice.
