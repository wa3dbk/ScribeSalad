00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.611
With the polynomial 2 x squared plus 12 x plus 10, we got really lucky in how we

00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:09.353
got to factor. Because there was a common factor of 2 between all three of these

00:00:09.353 --> 00:00:13.982
terms. But you can imagine that for some polynomials, whose coefficients in

00:00:13.982 --> 00:00:18.415
front of the x squared term aren't one, this won't be the case. Let's say for

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:22.391
example that we have an 11 here instead of a 12. Then we can no longer begin the

00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:26.356
problem by dividing all the terms by this 2. So we're not going to end up with a

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:30.469
quadratic expression with a 1 in front that we know how to factor right away. We

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:34.530
need to figure out another method for factoring. I think we should backtrack to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.545
the thing that we first started factoring with. Let's look at the general case

00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:42.632
of a quadratic polynomial that's been factored, and whose leading coefficient

00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:47.844
will be 1. We have x plus a and x plus b as our linear factors. Let's go through

00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:52.917
multiplying this out again. I know we've done it many times before. Okay, so

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:57.957
multiplying this out we get x squared plus the quantity a plus b, times x plus

00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:02.862
ab. What if instead of a and b we want to play with real numbers? But maybe in

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:07.542
playing with those real numbers, I want to keep the equation for the quadratic

00:01:07.542 --> 00:01:12.169
in this form. Let's say we start off with a polynomial x squared plus 5x plus 6.

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:16.774
We know that we can rewrite this, recognizing that 2 and 3 are factors of 6 and

00:01:16.774 --> 00:01:21.076
also add equal 5. As x squared plus, the quantity 2 plus 3, times x, plus 6.

00:01:21.076 --> 00:01:25.272
Which pretty simply becomes x squared plus 2x plus 3x plus 6. Great. Now this

00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:29.496
probably all seems simple leading up until now. But now I'm going to ask you to

00:01:29.496 --> 00:01:33.567
do something a little bit different. The thing that I'd like you to do that

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:37.593
probably will feel a little bit strange is look first at just the first two

00:01:37.593 --> 00:01:42.041
terms here. And find a factor between the two of them that's in common. Pull it

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:46.010
out and then write the rest of the equation in here, and then do the same thing

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.243
for the second pair of factors. Find a common factor and factor it out. And then

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.769
the expression you have after that, right here.
