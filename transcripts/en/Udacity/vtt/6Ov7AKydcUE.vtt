00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.460
We said old threats exist,
what about vulnerabilities?

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.090
So vulnerabilities
could be of many kind.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.390
For example, if you use a weak password,
that is a vulnerability.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.920
Someone can guess that password and
then be able to use that

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.790
to launch an attack which in this case
would be taking control of your account.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.310
If they are able to take
control of your account, well,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.300
that is a compromise of your account.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.890
If able to do it more broadly to
a system, that's a security breech.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.940
So an attack is a successful
exploitation of vulnerability

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.900
by a threat source, resulting in this
system that has been compromised.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.860
Unfortunately whatever it is,
are very hard to get rid of completely.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.220
And they can be found in software
that runs on our computer systems,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.710
networks, and lot of times
the biggest source of vulnerability

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.740
people say humans are the weak link.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.110
We do things that actually introduced
vulnerability into the systems.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.080
So the security mindset starts with
threats then we have to talk with

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.690
vulnerabilities and exploitation
of those within two attacks and

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.900
attacks result in compromise and
security breaches.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.440
We're going to use
a really simple example.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.330
You can call it a trivial example.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.170
To illustrate this idea of
a vulnerability an attack.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.200
So many of us ride our bikes.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.910
And of course it's
an important asset to us.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.278
It costs money to get one,
it gets you around, so obviously,

00:01:34.278 --> 00:01:38.063
it's useful to you, so,
it's the valuable asset.

00:01:38.063 --> 00:01:41.301
There are threats against it,
people steal bikes.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.258
Let's think about,
if we just leave it anywhere, obviously,

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:46.460
there's a serious vulnerabilities in it.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.460
The thief can walk and
take the bike away.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.130
So what we normally do, is we lock it.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.380
So as you see in this graphic,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.450
this person who is security conscious
actually has locked the bike.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.462
And they've gone off to class, or
to work, or whatever it is, and

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:06.848
you look at the system and you say well,
are there any vulnerabilities?

00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:10.213
Vulnerabilities, some we
may actually know about,

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.467
others many not even know about it.

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:15.113
It's the threat actor who
actually discovers it.

00:02:15.113 --> 00:02:17.940
And in cyber security
we call them zero day.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.879
The thief actually is not going
to fight the security that you

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.438
have in place here, which is the lock.

00:02:24.438 --> 00:02:26.606
And certainly what it is going to do is,

00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:29.581
it is going to walk away with
the bike minus the wheel.

00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:34.457
So vulnerability here was that this
asset that we have here the bike.

00:02:34.457 --> 00:02:37.300
Of course the people
have to buy a new wheel.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.490
But what he or
she is able to walk away with is

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.370
actually still fairly valuable,
isn't it?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.620
It's most of the bike, add a wheel and
you have a functioning bike.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.920
So the vulnerability we never
thought was that we had to secure

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.620
more then just the wheel, okay.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.460
The lock that we put is actually
only protecting the wheel.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.770
It's not protecting the entire bike.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.700
That's the example of vulnerability.
