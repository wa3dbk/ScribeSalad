00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.510
Sure, sure. That's a great question. So I would say, you

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.510
know, just as a, as a caveat, that really depends a

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.490
lot of the type of problems any given data scientists are

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.170
working on, the type of questions you're, you're looking at. For me

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.420
personally, a lot of the questions that, that I look at

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.420
and a lot of the things that interest me, tend to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.580
be fairly high level and somewhat loosely defined and I mentioned,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.480
looking a lot more at the social aspects of how people use

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.740
social networks. And a lot of topics like

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.390
that, sometimes the most useful thing is really

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.170
to just get a broad and qualitative understanding

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.890
of, of the data you're looking at. So,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.630
two of the most valuable techniques I found

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.350
for that are clustering. There are various approaches,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.510
k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering. And then other dimensionality

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.360
reduction techniques or things like principle component analysis, PCA.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.620
One, one thing, just speaking very specifically that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.220
I found very useful is the combination of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.530
k-means clustering and PCA. So if, if you

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.280
generate clusters and then use PCA to take the

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.110
most, meaningful vectors to plot those clusters on,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.760
you can often do a really nice job of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.460
reducing dimensionality of a data set and understanding,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.100
the significant differences between clusters in a visual way.
