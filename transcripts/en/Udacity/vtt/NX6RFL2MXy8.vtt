00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In this unit here, we'll have fun.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Somehow in the last couple of days on Facebook,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a discussion brought out what Sebastian's weight is.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I decided rather than telling people how much I weigh I turned this into statistics.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And upfront I want you to put everything together what we've done so far

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
using programming and since programming has been optional in this class

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
consider this unit optional but it'd be great if you had a chance to try it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's not that hard and at the end of the day you'll know something about me

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that I rarely discuss in public.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Through a comment I made in class on Facebook a discussion erupted in our

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Facebook STATS 101 discussion group what my actual weight is.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And here is the form that I posted.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
They were asked to submit their best estimate how much I weight in kilograms,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and also to submit how much they thought I weighed a year ago.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And within a few hours, there was a good number of guesses

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
including this one over here that's about as much as the planet Pluto weighs

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and also some negative guesses.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
These are both the negative weight of Pluto each.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But other than that, there were lots of really good guesses.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And you can see in kilograms, some people think I weigh 80 or 65, others think I weigh 250.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I took the good guesses and added them into a large list called weight.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
That's just below 100 of those and now I want to do a statistics on those.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The very first thing I did is I printed the mean estimate and it turns out to be negative.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's -2.10x10²⁰, and it's a typical situation in statistics.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
When you look at those numbers, most of them are actually pretty good guesses.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But these extreme guesses of 10²² or -10²² over here completely affect

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and screw up the actual statistics.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Now, you've learned how to deal with this. You know everything about statistics.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
What I want you to do is to now code a piece of software called calculate&lt;u&gt;weight&lt;/u&gt;

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
that has 3 things, and I think you can do all three of them yourself.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
First, I want you to remove the outliers by only extracting data

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
between the lower and upper quartile.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It turns out the number of data points make it well defined

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
what the lower and upper quartile is.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And all test cases we run through have a well-defined number of data points.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And all the test cases we'll be using will have the property

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that the lower and upper quartile are well-defined elements.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Then, I want you to fit a Gaussian using the maximum likelihood estimator.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And from there, I want you to compute the value x that corresponds

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
to the standard score z, so I'll be giving you not just the weight statistics or the weight data

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
but also where my extra weight is.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
If you plug in the standard score of -2, which is two standard deviations below the mean

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
of the data that we will estimate, you'll find out my extra weight that I took this morning.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It's amazingly accurate.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But definitely, the data that you guys provided for this was overestimating my weight

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and I'm happy to report by two standard deviations.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
All these formulas are known,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and I think you have all the coding skills necessary from the past to fill these gaps.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Obviously, the first step is the hardest.

00:03:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And when you're done with it, this command over here will give you the correct answer.
