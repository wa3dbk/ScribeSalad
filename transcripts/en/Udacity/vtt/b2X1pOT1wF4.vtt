00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.440
So we want to dive in a little deeper on this idea of code reuse.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.300
And in order to do so,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.680
we should really define what we mean when we say code reuse.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.440
Well, when you're writing software,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.440
reuse of code is the practice of writing generalized code

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.340
that can be relied upon to address a variety of different goals.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.280
Now, whenever you notice that two parts of your code have similarities,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.875
there's an opportunity to factor out the similar aspects of it

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:28.280
into some reusable library code so

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.400
that you won't have to repeat yourself in either of the two original places.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.760
So here's an example we can use to think about code reuse.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.760
Imagine you wanted to write a simple game that involves cars driving

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.800
along a street.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.840
The player is on the run from a crime syndicate and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.210
has to avoid their goons, who drive around in these unmarked vans.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.490
Our program is going to need to keep track of a lot of data about each of

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.738
the entities moving around the system, and so

00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:56.341
we'll use object-oriented techniques a lot here.

00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:59.259
Now that we know what we're shooting for, let's put these mockups away and

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:00.910
focus on the code that we're going to write.
