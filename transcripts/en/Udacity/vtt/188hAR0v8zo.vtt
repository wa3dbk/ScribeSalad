00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.810
The answer is that L is not
recognizable, but L complement is.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.880
Note that there are some Turing
machines that accept nothing

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.130
that we can tell accept nothing.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.089
We can examine the code, for instance
of the Turing machine that immediately

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.570
transitions to the reject
state no matter what.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.220
And we can see that such a Turing
machine never accepts anything.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.400
But it's not clear that we
can do that in general.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.420
On the other hand, it turns out
that we can recognize L complement,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.290
the set of Turing machines
that accept something.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.950
We just run the Turing machine on all
strings and see if accepts any of them.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.480
Now, if you answered no here because
you thought of this possibility, but

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.920
were worried that some of these
computations might not halt and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.010
that that would ruin it,
then actually good for you.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.110
It shows that you're thinking carefully.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.680
This is a real problem, because we can't
just run M on the empty string, and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.840
then run it on the zero string,
and so forth.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.460
The computation on the empty
string might never halt.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.870
The solution is essentially to run
all these computations in parallel.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.440
Note that this is challenging, but

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.660
it can be done through
a strategy called dovetailing.
