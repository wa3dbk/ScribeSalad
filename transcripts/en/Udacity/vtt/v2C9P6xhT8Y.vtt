00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.800
I think that we need to start at x equals 0. Remember that x stands for the

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.644
number of days that have passed since Grant started using his advertising

00:00:07.644 --> 00:00:11.704
agency. We can't really have negative days, or at least in this situation that

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:15.479
doesn't make sense. So I think that the graph should start here and then

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:19.406
continue upward just as we had it. So this would just be omitting the values

00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:22.574
where we would have a negative number of days having passed.
