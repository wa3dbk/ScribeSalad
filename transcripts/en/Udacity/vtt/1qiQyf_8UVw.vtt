Finally, I think we're ready to help Grant. Remember that he left us with this

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.130
equation, x squared plus 25 x minus 150 equals 0. Remember that x here stands

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.596
for the number of feet that Grant wants to add to each side of the booth. He's

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:17.907
going to add the same amount to each side. So, how can we use our new found

00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:22.919
factoring skills to rewrite the left side of this equation? Please fill in the

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.138
two binomial factors that multiply to equal the left side.
