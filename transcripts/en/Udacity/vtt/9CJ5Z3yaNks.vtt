00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.221
It turns out all of these are true. 5 and 6 sum to 11. 5 and 6 are also used as

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:10.144
the coefficients of x to rewrite 11x. We know 5 and 6 is a factor pair of 30

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:15.953
since they multiply to give us 30. And finally we can see that a positive 5 and

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:18.947
positive 6 up here in our binomials.
