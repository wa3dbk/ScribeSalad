00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.078
Thanks, Michael. Now, let's move on to our final sleep disorder that we're

00:00:03.078 --> 00:00:06.763
going to cover, insomnia. This is probably the most commonly known sleep

00:00:06.763 --> 00:00:12.004
disorder. This can result in people having difficulty falling asleep, staying

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:16.934
asleep, or both. Either one of these or both of them results in a poor quality

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:22.330
of sleep. And the individual will wake up tired and not well rested. We've

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.948
already learned about the physical and mental effects of sleep deprivation, so

00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:31.070
chronic insomnia may result in detrimental healthy consequences. Acute insomnia

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.480
can result from stressful events we experience, traumas or work and family

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.591
pressures. It can last from days to weeks. In addition to feeling less

00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:47.150
energetic, insomnia may cause one to feel irritable, anxious, even depressed.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.566
This again makes a clear point that adequate sleep and quality of sleep is

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.879
essential for our physical and mental health.
