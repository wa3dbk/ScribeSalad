00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.200
Think of it like playing darts. The standard height from the floor to the

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.920
bullseye is 5 feet 8 inches, and then you have to stand 7 feet 9 and 1 fourth

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.854
inches back from the dartboard. Then dartboard makers had to decide how big the

00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:21.960
dartboard should be. Bigger targets or even the wall are easier to hit. But

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.448
it's also more likely we hit them by chance. Smaller targets are harder to hit,

00:00:25.448 --> 00:00:29.824
but when we hit them, we can be more confident we didn't hit them by chance. So

00:00:29.824 --> 00:00:32.944
the bulls eye should be big enough that it's possible to hit it, but small

00:00:32.944 --> 00:00:38.510
enough so that if we hit it, it's due to skill. There has to be a balance.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.902
These targets on a dart board are analogous to the critical regions, with the

00:00:41.902 --> 00:00:45.188
boundary of each region on the dartboard analogous to the different alpha

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:50.412
levels. We can easily get a mean within this area, in the middle of the

00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:54.764
distribution, but if a mean lands beyond a z score of 1.64, the probability of

00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:58.980
getting this mean is less than 0.05, the alpha level, and it's not likely to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.844
have occurred by chance. It's even more unlikely to occur by chance if the mean

00:01:07.844 --> 00:01:13.373
lands beyond z equals 2.32. The probability there is .01, and it's super

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:20.140
unlikely to have occurred by chance. If the mean lands beyond z equals 3.08.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.524
This is like striking the bullseye.
