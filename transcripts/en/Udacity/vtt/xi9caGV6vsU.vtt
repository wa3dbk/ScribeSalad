00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.906
We just came to the conclusion that all real numbers are complex and all

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:08.147
imaginary numbers are also complex. However, we also saw a different number

00:00:08.147 --> 00:00:12.372
earlier the one that motivated our entire discussion of complex numbers, but

00:00:12.372 --> 00:00:16.142
seemed to not fit into the category of real numbers, or the category of

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:21.011
imaginary numbers perfectly. So, I think what we need is a general statement for

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:25.610
the form of a complex number, which of these do you think is a way to write that

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.531
general form. Please note here that in all these answer choices a and b are real

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:31.153
numbers.
