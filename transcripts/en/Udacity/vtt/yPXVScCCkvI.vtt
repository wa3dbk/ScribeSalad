00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.710
Okay, so in cycle 13 we have seen that this instruction begins executing and

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.530
also the rob six instruction was dispatched because it captured the same result.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.990
And begins executing, and it will eventually go towards the value of three.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.690
The question for you is in addition to basically this instructions capturing

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.000
values in this batching, does anything else happen in cycle 13?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.680
Right here, what happens, issue, execution, write of result or

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.180
commit, just write one letter. And the number of the ROB entry here. So for

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.870
example, if you think that instruction ROB two writes result, write W two, here.
