00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.400
Having seen SPIN's approach to extensibility, now we will look at Exokernel's

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.360
approach to operating system extensibility. The

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.280
name, Exokernel, itself comes from the

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.720
fact that the kernel exposes hardware

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.120
explicitly to the operating system extensions

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:26.580
living above it. The basic idea in Exokernel, is to decouple authorization

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.420
of the hardware from its actual use. let's say

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.750
you want to do research in my lab. I

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.160
may interview you, and once we're on the same

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.010
page, I'll give you a key to the lab. And

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.820
the resources you need in order to do work

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.210
in the lab. Mm, example, laptop, servers and so

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.610
on. Then I get out of the way. When

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.060
you actually use the resources, that's exactly the same idea

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.280
in Exokernel. Library operating system asks for a resource. Exokernel will

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.810
validate the request for the resource from the library. And bind the request

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.300
to the specific hardware resource. In

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.250
other words, Exokernel exposes the hardware

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.700
that was requested by the Library OS through creating a secure binding between

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.170
the ask and the actual hardware resource. Once Exokernel has established

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.150
this binding, it creates an encrypted key for the resource, and gives it to

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.090
the requesting library operating system. Similar to the analogy that I gave

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.970
you, of a student using my lab resources, the semantics of how the resource

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.800
is going to be used by the library is entirely up to the library.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.320
Of course, within the norm of accepted use, similar to what I may impose

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.750
as certain restrictions or rules of behavior

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.750
that students have to observe in the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.190
lab. Same way, there are certain accepted

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.120
norms for the user's resource that Exokernel may

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.500
have imposed. And so long as the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.900
library operating system is staying within those norms,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.130
then the semantics of how a particular

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.710
hardware resource is used is entirely up to

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.540
the library operating system. Once a library

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.760
operating system has asked for a resource and

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.560
Exokernel has created the binding for that

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.190
resource to the requesting library operating system, then,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.740
the operating system is now ready to use the resource. Now, how does it use

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.560
the resource? Basically, what the library operating

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.380
system will do is present the encrypted key

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.110
that is received, authenticating that use of

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.600
the resource for this library to the Exokernel.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.890
In other words, Exokernel will be able

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.380
to validate whether the key presented to it,

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.848
is the key that was presented for this particular

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:04.580
libraries operating system. So in other words, the key

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.910
cannot be forged, cannot be passed around. If I

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.230
gave a key to this library operating system, that

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.970
key, if it is presented to the Exokernel by

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.850
this library operating system, it's a valid key. Even

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.240
if it's a valid key, but it is not

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.760
the operating system to which Exokernel gave the key,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.690
then that request would be denied. So with

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.990
a valid key, any time the library operating

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.664
system can present the key to the Exokernel,

00:03:32.664 --> 00:03:36.390
Exokernel will validate it, and then, the library

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.390
operating system is free to go in using

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.790
that resource for which it has this valid

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.560
key. This is sort of like a doorman

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.980
in an apartment building, checking when a resident comes

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.380
in, whether the resident is a bona fide

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.380
occupant of the residence. Once inside his apartment,

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.600
what the resident does is not something that

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.490
the doorman cares about. Exactly the same thing

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.100
is being done by Exokernel as a doorman

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.220
for using the hardware resource for which a

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.480
valid key exists with a library operating system.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.080
So, establishing the secure binding is a heavy

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.649
duty operation. That's where Exokernel comes in the middle of saying, well, this

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.360
particular library operating system wants access

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.350
to a specific resource, can I give

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.090
it? And it makes that decision. Once such a secure binding has been

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.540
established, the actual use of the hardware is going to be much cheaper.
