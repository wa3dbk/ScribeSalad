00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.700
Now we know that we can refer to
XML resources in the Java code.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.680
But what exactly is the relationship
between the resources and the Java code?

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.380
How do they come together as
part of a full app experience?

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.215
Let's start at the point when you
click on the JustJava app icon.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.615
It opens up the Main Activity.

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:21.925
Now you don't see anything yet
because it's still being initialized.

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:25.835
Thankfully, a lot of the complexity
involved in initializing the activity is

00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:28.565
handled automatically for
you by Android.

00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:31.995
The important part that we care about
is that in the Main Activity file,

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:34.875
the onCreate method gets
called automatically.

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:37.590
This is when the activity
is getting created.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.580
There's a bunch of work and
then we have an important line that says

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.120
setContentView and then the resource
ID for the layout file.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.640
It's R.layout.activity_main.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.280
This means that the content view of
the activity should be set to the layout

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.720
as specified in
the activity main XML file.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.700
This is the method call and
the input parameter is this resource ID.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.600
Once you set the lay out that you're
going to use for the content view,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.660
then the android device can go ahead and
start parsing this XML layout file.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.410
Parsing is like reading this file and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.490
trying to interpret that like
oh this is a linear layout.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.570
Oh this is a text view.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.270
These are the attributes, and so on.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.850
So it's trying to understand
what this file contains.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.960
The Android device starts by
reading at the top of the file.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.670
It recognizes that there's
a linear layout here.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.170
Then it inflates a Java object
to represent that linear layout.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.570
Then it goes to the next line and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.120
sees that we need to add a TextView as a
child to that linear layout, like that.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.865
This is starting to look like
the view hierarchy from lesson two.

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:43.125
What I didn't tell you earlier is
that this is actually a hierarchy

00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:45.265
of Java objects.

00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:47.975
We're going to be learning more about
Java objects in the coming videos so

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:50.515
it's okay if you don't
fully understand it yet.

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:53.085
When we get to the next line
we see that we need to inflate

00:01:53.085 --> 00:01:55.385
a linear layout Java object.

00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:58.855
That gets added as a child
to this root LinearLayout.

00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:00.480
Then we see a Button element.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.300
So we add that as a child
to the LinearLayout.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.470
So we continue down the file until we've
inflated all the views that we need for

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.280
our view hierarchy.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.740
Once we have this view hierarchy of Java
objects, then we can manipulate them and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.470
change them while the app is running.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.930
An object like the TextView here
contains state information.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.070
Like the text, the text color,
the text size.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.880
The object also has methods so
we can call those methods and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.130
change their internal state.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.670
So for example, we can change
the text while the app is running.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.700
Interacting with all these objects is
called object oriented programming.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.220
We will cover this in more
detail in the coming videos.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.230
So to summarize, in the main activity
when we call setContentView to this

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.440
layout, then we read this layout and
then inflate a bunch of Java objects.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.590
These Java objects make up
the view hierarchy of the app.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.920
The MainActivity holds on to
this view hierarchy, and then

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.400
as you interact with the MainActivity,
it can update these objects.
