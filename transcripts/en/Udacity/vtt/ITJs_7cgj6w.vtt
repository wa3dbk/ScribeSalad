00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.543
Before we start coding
our content provider,

00:00:03.693 --> 00:00:06.336
let's make sure the manifest
is set up correctly.

00:00:06.716 --> 00:00:09.450
You need to update
the androidmanifest.xml file

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.010
within the application tag
to add the content provider

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.960
so that Android's content resolver
can see it.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.340
The authority really should match
your package name.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.660
While the name indicates which file

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.850
your content provider class is in.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.180
Next, let's code up onCreate.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.850
We'll begin by
creating an instance variable

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.513
for our database helper.

00:00:30.123 --> 00:00:33.406
In onCreate, we
initialize our instance variable.

00:00:33.406 --> 00:00:36.210
We return true,
which is how we tell Android

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.340
that the content provider
has been created successfully.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.060
It turns out that we
can repurpose the same test

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.860
we did for the database
to test our new content provider.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.920
This will allow you
to both test your content provider code

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.210
and see how the content provider calls
replace the SQLIte database calls.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.560
Let's start by using Android Studio

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.730
to copy TestDB to test provider.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.050
Let's rename test create DB,
to test delete DB.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.266
So we can start with a clean slate.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.717
We'll just leave the
nContext.deleteDatatbase line in there.

00:01:14.998 --> 00:01:17.000
We'll leave the other test the same,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.810
we'll get to it soon.
