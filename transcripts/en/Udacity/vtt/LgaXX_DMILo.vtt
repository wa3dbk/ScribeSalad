00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.065
Sometimes, using a library
is the right answer.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:07.330
While they can hide
implementation details,

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.140
they make complex scenarios much
easier to deal with and can soften

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.798
some of the sharp edges compared
to hand-rolling your own solution.

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:22.293
Service Worker Precache is a node
module for auto-magically generating

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:27.000
a service worker that will
precache your AppShell resources.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.640
By adding a few extra configuration
parameters, you can also define

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.640
runtime caching options,
perfect for our application data.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.950
The module is designed for
use with Gulp or

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.870
Grunt build scripts, though it also
provides a command line interface.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.440
The module's API provides a method for
creating a service worker and

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.408
saving the resulting code to a file.

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:56.270
The advantage of including
it in your build script

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.140
is that it can automatically run,
whenever a file changes.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.250
You don't need to manually
update it every time.
