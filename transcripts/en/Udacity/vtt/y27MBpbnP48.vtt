00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.354
We can easily calculate the probability for discrete samples like this one in a

00:00:05.354 --> 00:00:10.620
discrete population, but what about in real life, with huge populations? We

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.230
can't possibly calculate the mean of every possible sample of size n and even if

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.597
we could, we wouldn't want to. We ended up with 16 samples when we just had a

00:00:21.597 --> 00:00:27.240
population of size 4. What if we had a population of 350 million? Which is often

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.400
the case. Well, you've already seen that the distribution of sample means is

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.210
normal. And we know that the mean of all these sample means is the population

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.943
mean. Remember, the population mean here was 2.5. And the mean of all possible

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:48.132
sample means is also 2.5. So, if we have a random sample and we take the mean of

00:00:48.132 --> 00:00:53.550
it, how can we know where it falls on this distribution of sample means. We're

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.938
missing one important thing. Do we need to know the total number in the

00:00:57.938 --> 00:01:03.538
population? The standard deviation of the distribution of sample means? Which is

00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:07.379
this here. Or, the total number of possible samples?
