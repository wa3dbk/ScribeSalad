00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.170
This is Android Wear.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.600
It's simple, glanceable, and
built around micro-interactions.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.170
Now, the interface is divided
into two primary behaviors.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.170
First, the user can
talk to the wearable.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.490
Okay, Google, set a timer for
five minutes.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.300
You can think of these as actions.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.490
Also, the wearable can talk to the user,
and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.110
you can think of this
as the context stream.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.810
It's sort of like enhanced notifications
that matter to the user right now

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.200
because it's the right time or place.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.240
That's the basic framework and
it sets you up for success.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.820
But to really make it all the way there,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.670
you need to carry the design philosophy
into your application as well.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.350
Let's talk about that in more detail.
