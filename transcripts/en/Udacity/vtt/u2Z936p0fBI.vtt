00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.650
The second myth concerns going across protection domains and espeiclaly if the

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.590
protection domains are impmlemented as distinct

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.360
hardware address spaces, then the myth

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.100
is that crossing protection domains implemented

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.640
using hardware address space switch is

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.230
expensive. And we are now talking

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.630
explicit cost for crossing protection domains implemented

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.060
as distinct hardware address spaces. Not the implicit

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.880
cost, we're only talking about the explicit cost

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.060
of crossing protection domain. Now, let's understand what

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.210
is involved in an address space switch. This

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.770
is a refresher to show you what exactly

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.910
is happening in terms of translating a virtual

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.130
address to a physical address. You all know

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.830
about the concept of a TLB and the virtual

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.930
address consists of two parts; an index part and a tag. The index is used to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.050
look up the TLB and the tag that is contained in that particular entry of the

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.140
TLB is matched against the tag coming from

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.480
the virtual address. If they match, then we

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.180
got a hit, then this particular virtual address

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.860
is contained in the TLB entry and you've got

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.900
the physical frame number that corresponds to the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.750
virtual page number that you started with, so

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.450
that is your, very simple, TLB, matching hardware

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.720
that does the address translation from VPN to

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.200
PFN. Now what happens on an address space

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.290
switch? That is a context switch going from

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.120
one address space to another address space. On

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.190
a context switch, the virtual address to physical address

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.170
mapping will change for the new process that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.970
is going to be scheduled. So in other words,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.870
if this TLB contains the translations for a

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.810
particular process that is currently executing on the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.580
CPU, if we do a context switch, do we have to flush the TLB because the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.270
virtual address to physical address mapping is going to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.540
be different for the new process or new thread

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.560
that is going to run on the processor now? The answer to the question do

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.370
we have to throw away the mappings that exist in the TLB, when we do a context

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.660
switch, is, it depends. It depends on whether the

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.760
TLB has a way of recognizing that the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.300
virtual to physical address translation that is contained in it, is flagged

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.280
by the distinct process for which those translations have been put into

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.270
the TLB. In other words, if the TLB has address

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.080
space tags in addition to the tag for disambiguating one

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.230
virtual address from another virtual address then you don't have

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.362
to flush the TLB. So these are what are called address space tag TLBs

00:02:58.362 --> 00:03:06.960
which contain the process ID for which a particular TLB entry is present

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.960
in the TLB. MIPS Architecture for instance uses address space tagged TLBs.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.160
But on the other hand, an architecture may not use an address space tagged TLB.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.260
Intel 486, and Intel Pentium are examples of architectures that

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.440
do not have address space tags associated in

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.250
the TLB. So, in an Intel architecture, at

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.530
the point of the context switch, you have

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.990
to throw away all the entries that are there

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.620
in the TLB on behalf of the process.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.630
In the Intel architecture, actually the TLB is

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.500
split into two parts, a user part and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.020
a kernel part. And the kernel part is common

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.940
regardless of which process is running. And

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.670
therefore, you don't have to flush that portion

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.710
of the TLB, the kernel portion of the TLB, but the user portion of the TLB

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.490
has to be flushed on a context

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.360
switch because the virtual address, the physical address

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.580
mapping, is going to be different for the new

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.860
process that starts to run on the processor.
