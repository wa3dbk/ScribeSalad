00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.100
So here's the code, that we had at the end of unit two. Our goal

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.780
now is to modify that code, instead of printing all links, to get all links.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.460
The good news is, the get_next_target we don't have to change

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.480
at all. We still want to find the next URL in the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.530
page. We're going to need to make a few changes to print

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.030
all links to make get all links. But not too many.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.210
The first change we need to make is we need to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.630
introduce a variable to keep track of the results. So I'll

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.010
call that variable links. I'll leave it as a quiz for

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.570
you to figure out what the initial value of links should be.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.150
Remember, our goal for get_all_links is that

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.420
at the end of get_all_links, it will

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.270
return a list containing all of the links that we found on this page.
