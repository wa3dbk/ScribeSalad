00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.972
Now at certain points in the course you may need to enter coordinate pairs using

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:07.932
of course typical coordinate notation with parenthesis around the outside of

00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:12.242
them that contain fractions for the coordinate values. This is actually a little

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:16.495
bit tricky to do in mathquill so we are going to talk about who you do this. I'm

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:20.290
going to tell you exactly how to type this out. So let's say that we wanted to

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.988
type. So, let's say that this is the order pair that we want to type. 3 over 4,

00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:27.527
negative 1 and a half. I'm going to tell you exactly what keys to press. And

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:31.266
then what will appear as you type each one of them. So, the first thing we have

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:35.355
is this open parentheses. But when you type that, both parentheses appear. The

00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:39.184
next step is to type a forward slash. At which point, the space inside the two

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:43.056
parentheses, will turn into the input for a fraction. So there will be a line,

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:46.970
and a space for you to enter the numerator and the denominator. Your cursor at

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.867
this point will be in the numerator. And as unintuitive as it might seem, what

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:54.222
we want to do, is to get the cursor to be right here, inside the first

00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:58.398
parentheses. But before we have the option to type inside the fraction. So you

00:00:58.398 --> 00:01:02.325
just need to type a left arrow key to move the cursor over here. Then you can

00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:06.518
type a comma, which will be the comma between our two coordinates. At this point

00:01:06.518 --> 00:01:10.642
your cursor will be right here, between the comma and the fraction spot. So you

00:01:10.642 --> 00:01:14.678
need to type the left arrow key to move it back here. Now we just need to create

00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:18.853
the first coordinate. Then you need to type a forward slash again. Which will

00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:22.558
create another spot for a fraction to be input. And then you can use the arrow

00:01:22.558 --> 00:01:26.038
keys as you normally would between fractions to go to each numerator and

00:01:26.038 --> 00:01:29.833
denominator and enter the values that you want to. So you can see that whats

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:33.314
happening here, in terms of the order that things appeared in over here

00:01:33.314 --> 00:01:37.090
depending on what I told you to type, that you have to actually create the spot

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.006
for the Second coordinate as a fraction before you create the first one. If you

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:44.803
try to create one fraction and then put a comma, it's not going to work. Another

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:48.451
option would be for you to create two separate fraction spots and then move to

00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:51.987
the spot between the two of them and then put a comma. This is just a way that

00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:55.614
works really easily for me. But of course, as always, you can experiment and

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:59.592
figure out what works best for you. So, thinking about how you create 2

00:01:59.592 --> 00:02:04.007
coordinates that are each fractions. I'd like you to try out typing each of

00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:08.303
these coordinate pairs. First one we have is 3 4ths, negative 1 half. Then we

00:02:08.303 --> 00:02:12.707
have 1, 2 over 7. And then we have negative 1 8th, 3. So just play around with

00:02:12.707 --> 00:02:16.210
these, and see if you can get comfortable with this format.
