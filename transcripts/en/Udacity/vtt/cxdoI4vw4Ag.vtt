00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.251
Before we dig into
the camera perspective,

00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:06.487
viewport awesomeness that is the rest of
this lesson, let's learn one more shape.

00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:08.344
The shape renderer can make for us.

00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:09.590
Circles.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.800
Also partial circle or arcs.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.697
We're going to explore more
code in the course repository.

00:00:14.697 --> 00:00:17.670
You can load up this project
yourself and follow along.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.700
To dig in, let's check out the TODOs.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.299
Here's the most basic circle you can
draw, specifying the x position of

00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:27.901
the center, the y position of the
center, and the radius of the circle.

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.320
And there we go, it's beautiful, right?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.555
We can also draw a partial circle or an
arc, by specifying the number of degrees

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:39.800
counter-clockwise from the positive
x-axis that the arc should start And

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.160
how many more degrees it should
keep going from that point.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.535
So this line is 45 degrees
from the positive x-axis in

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:48.666
the counter clockwise direction.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.424
And then 270 degrees is three
quarters of a circle, so

00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:53.440
we get this Pac-Man shape.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.850
Circles have a dirty
little secret though.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.547
They're not really circles, they're
a fan of triangles where all their

00:00:59.547 --> 00:01:02.419
triangles have their points
at the center of the circle.

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:05.489
ShapeRenderer will pick how
many triangles to use so

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.033
the circle looks smooth.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:11.123
But if you make super small circles,
it might choose to use too few.

00:01:11.123 --> 00:01:14.406
This optional last parameter sets
the number of segments to use.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:17.600
Let's see what happens when we
set the segment count too low.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.260
If we set the segment count too low,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.040
we end up with a circle that
looks like a stop sign.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.540
This can also happen if you're
drawing very small circles but

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.450
you're zoomed way in on them.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.926
Circles can be drawn using either
ShapeType filled or ShapeType line.

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:33.481
The ladder draws just
the outline of the circle.

00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:35.874
If we want to draw
both solid circles and

00:01:35.874 --> 00:01:39.138
the outlines of circles in
the same render callback,

00:01:39.138 --> 00:01:43.434
we first need to end our filled batch
and begin a new batch in line mode.

00:01:43.434 --> 00:01:44.280
let's give this a try.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.850
There we go, a circle drawn in line
mode is just the outline of the circle.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.993
let's try something crazy and
draw some target rings.

00:01:52.993 --> 00:01:54.270
Bam, there we go.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.616
We can also draw just the outline
of an arc just like so.

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:04.215
And if we draw the outlines of a bunch
of arcs stacked up on top of each other,

00:02:04.215 --> 00:02:07.073
we can draw some funky
snail shell like thing.

00:02:07.073 --> 00:02:10.773
Remember, if any of this seemed
too complicated or went too fast,

00:02:10.773 --> 00:02:12.567
don't just take my word for it.

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:15.457
You've got all this code sitting on
your computer so check it out and

00:02:15.457 --> 00:02:16.480
play with it yourself.
