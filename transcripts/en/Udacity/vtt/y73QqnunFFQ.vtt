00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.237
So now, this is what our term looks like, 5 times 7 times 2 times x times y

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:08.877
times z. Now, this definitely looks different from how our term originally did,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.683
but I wouldn't say that it looks less complicated yet. So our goal for this quiz

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:18.134
is to make this look much more simple. So think back to when we were talking

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:22.865
about Grant's gleaming glasses last time. We simplified this term, 11 times 2n

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:27.855
to equal 22n. By using the same idea that we used to come up with that answer,

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:32.695
can you think of a way to simplify this term up here? Try to squish it down as

00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:37.505
much as you can, and remember to get rid of any multiplication signs that you

00:00:37.517 --> 00:00:39.475
don't think need to be explicit.
