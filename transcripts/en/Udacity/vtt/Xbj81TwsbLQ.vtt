00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.800
The instance variable, form the long term memory of an object. The kind of

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.700
thing that an object wants to remember for a very long time. The local

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.150
variables, on the other hand, are the equivalent of the short term memory. You

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.030
may remember that you had pizza today but you won't remember it for very long.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.060
Whereas you'll always remember your cat. Technically speaking the local

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.980
variables go away when you reach the end of the method. The instance variables

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.430
never go away. They stay alive as long as the object is alive. So when do you

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.050
want to make a variable an instance variable? You want to do that for those

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.060
values that an object needs to remember throughout multiple methods. You want

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.870
to make something a local variable when you can forget about it after exiting

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.270
the method. In this case here we compute the gas consumed for driving this

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.870
particular distance, update the gasInTank. And then we no longer care that this

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.090
was the particular amount of gas consumed. We can safely forget it when we exit

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.100
the method. That's why we put this variable inside the method and made it into

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.170
a local variable.
