00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.380
The techniques and behavior patterns
of intruders are constantly shifting

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.280
in order to exploit newly discovered
weaknesses, and to evade detection and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.160
counter measures.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.880
However, intruders typically use steps
from a common attack methodology.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.230
Here are the common attack steps.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.410
The first step is target acquisition and
information gathering.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.502
That is, the attacker identifies
the target systems using publicly

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:34.330
available information,
both technical and non-technical and

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.944
use network tools to
analyze target resources.

00:00:37.944 --> 00:00:41.934
For example, the attackers can
find out what network services

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:44.820
are accessible from the Internet.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.700
And the attacker may find
out some email accounts

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.900
of high level company executives.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.340
The second step is initial access.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.270
This is accomplished by exploiting
a remote network vulnerability.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.240
For example, a network service has
a buffer overflow vulnerability that

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.302
allows a remote attack to take over
the service and gain access to a system.

00:01:06.302 --> 00:01:11.293
Or this can be accomplished by social
engineering, whereby, for example,

00:01:11.293 --> 00:01:15.976
an attacker can send an email to a
company executive with an attachment so

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:21.730
that when the attachment is clicked,
a malware is installed on the system.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.260
The third step is privilege escalation.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.852
This is taken after the initial access.

00:01:27.852 --> 00:01:33.436
And the attacker would try to use local
exploit to escalate the privilege from,

00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:39.130
for example, the normal user to root
privilege on the target system.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.660
The fourth step is information
gathering or system exploit.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.340
That is, after an attacker has gained
sufficient privilege on a system,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.310
he can then find out more about
the network and the organization.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.661
And even move to another target system
to further the exploit on the network.

00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:01.400
The fifth step is maintaining access.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.980
This is important because an attack
may not be a one-time action.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.960
That is, the attacker may choose
to come back from time to time, or

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.770
continue the exploit for awhile.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.900
Therefore, the attacker may install
backdoors or other malicious software on

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.930
a target system so that he can
continue to access this target system.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.950
Lastly, the attacked wants
to cover his tracks.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.560
For example, the attacker can disable or

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.380
even edit the system audit logs to
remove evidence of attack activities.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.270
Or the attacker may install root
kits to hide the installed malware.
