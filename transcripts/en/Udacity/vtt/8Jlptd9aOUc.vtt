00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.224
This equation would just be an ellipse. Now you might have thought that it was

00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:08.626
hyperbola since we have a subtraction of y squared but remember we need the x

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:14.650
squared and y squared to be on the same side of the equation. So if we add y

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.674
squared to both sides of the equation we would get this one. We can see that

00:00:19.674 --> 00:00:22.898
there's a plus sign in between the x squared terms and the y squared terms so

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:28.099
we either have a circle or no ellipse. And since we have different amounts of x

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.100
squared and y squared we know that the equation represents an ellipse.
