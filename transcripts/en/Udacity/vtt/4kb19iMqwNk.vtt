00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.497
Here's the whole meaning for the dot product. For any two arbitrary coordinates.

00:00:04.497 --> 00:00:08.338
We'll go through a piece at a time. This first part we're used to. If you have a

00:00:08.338 --> 00:00:12.559
normalized a and b vector, then the cosine of the angle between the two is the

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.202
dot product. However, when a or b are not normalized, in other words the length

00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:21.735
is not equal to one, the dot product also consists of these two factors. The

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:26.094
length of a times the length of b times the cosine of the angle between the 2.

00:00:26.094 --> 00:00:30.069
To sum up, you can think of a coordinate as moving due to a rotation or staying

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:34.508
still, and just being recategorized by a new set of axes. To throw 1 more term

00:00:34.508 --> 00:00:39.876
at you, these 3 axes are called a basis, and this is a term you'll see as soon

00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:42.443
as you get into vector math at all.
