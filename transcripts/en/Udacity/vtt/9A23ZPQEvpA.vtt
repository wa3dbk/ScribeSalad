Now that you have completed
your professional profile,

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.930
we get to craft the headline.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.310
Your headline appears in search
results beneath your name and photo.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.630
With one simple title, you'll harness
the power to craft your personal brand.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.430
When I first created a LinkedIn Presence,
I didn't realize that this

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.430
headline didn't necessarily need
to be my current job title.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.009
Luckily, I discovered that
you can customize it.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.350
Your headline is a great place to use
positive language to your advantage.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.360
For example, rather than using
a phrase like seeking employment,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.510
which might be read as unemployed,
you can use a positive phrase like

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.060
web development professional or
builder, creator, and web developer.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.300
This is an extremely helpful way to take
control over your professional career

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.910
path and story.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.540
Wherever you are in a job search,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.970
you can create a headline that best
of aligns with your target jobs.
