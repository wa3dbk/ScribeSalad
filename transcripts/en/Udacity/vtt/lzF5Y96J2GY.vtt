00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.065
To get started, we add in some nice little sanity checking to ensure that we're

00:00:03.065 --> 00:00:05.731
not actually trying to do operations on null data that may cause the game to

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:09.871
crash. Or we're not trying to set the energy on an entity that has been marked

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:14.106
for death. If the user is not already at max energy, that means that we can go

00:00:14.106 --> 00:00:18.950
ahead and modify its value. For this purposes, we set that all energy canisters

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.515
will update the physOwner.energy value by plus 10. Once that's been done, we

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:26.440
simply call the mark for death flag to true, allowing the sweeping function to

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.300
destroy this object.
