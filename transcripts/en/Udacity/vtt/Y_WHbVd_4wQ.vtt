00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.832
Let's see how you did. If you have a pair of jeans that a store paid $23 for and

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:11.614
they mark it up by 32%, customers will pay $30.36. Let's see how we got 30.36.

00:00:11.737 --> 00:00:17.568
Well we know the original price of the jeans was $23 and they were marked up by

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.617
32%. Since they were marked up, we add 32% to 100% So 100 percent plus

00:00:22.617 --> 00:00:23.687
32 percent is 132%.

00:00:23.697 --> 00:00:30.625
Remember when you do problems with percents, they, you always have to convert

00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:36.681
the percentage to a decimal. To convert 132 percent to a decimal, we have to

00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:41.148
move the decimal over two places. So 132 percent is 1.32.

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:45.375
Now, we just have to multiply 23 times 1.32, and when you multiply those

00:00:45.387 --> 00:00:49.765
together, you get 30.36. Now, one thing to keep in mind is whenever you're

00:00:49.777 --> 00:00:54.155
solving word problems, you have to remember to put units. So, in this case,

00:00:54.257 --> 00:00:59.025
we're talking about dollars, so the answer is going to be $30.36. Don't forget

00:00:59.037 --> 00:01:00.320
to put the dollar sign.
