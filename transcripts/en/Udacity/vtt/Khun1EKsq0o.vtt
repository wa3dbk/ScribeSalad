00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.755
One method of adding indirect illumination in a scene is to capture the effect

00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:08.560
of surrounding light for various points in space. Here's a view of the idea

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.830
from work by Greger Et Alia in 1998. The spheres represent the captured

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.129
illumination. For a point on a surface in space, the nearby spheres are

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.488
accessed by the surfaces normal and blended together. There are many different

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:26.533
texture map types, what type of map would these spheres use? Specular map?

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:33.424
Normal map? Diffuse environment map? Refraction Map? Displacement Map? Or Road

00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:33.929
map?
