Thanks for doing that. So now remember we're trying to decide if me singing a

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.806
song that I wrote about hypothesis testing is going to increase your engagement

00:00:07.806 --> 00:00:13.385
in learning. In the last example, confidence intervals were really great when

00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:18.904
we were trying to estimate the actually population parameters. For example the

00:00:18.904 --> 00:00:24.530
engagement from our example before. In this case, the dependant variable, so

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.790
the engagements ratio, makes sense by itself, we understand what that means.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.354
The number of minutes students spend watching the course to the total amount of

00:00:34.354 --> 00:00:38.824
minutes that are available. But in this case, your self-reported measures of

00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:43.430
engagment and learning aren't as well defined. And there subject to your

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.214
individual perceptions of what good, engagement and learning are. Obviously

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.854
higher numbers, like nines and tens are better, but what does it really mean if

00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:57.183
you report your engagement as seven. In this case we don't care as much what

00:00:57.183 --> 00:01:02.790
the actually between one and ten will be. We just want to see if the

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.733
intervention or the song possibly has an effect.
