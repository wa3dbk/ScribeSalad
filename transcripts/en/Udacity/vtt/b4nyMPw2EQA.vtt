00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Let's try a graph here on this left side and then I'll have you figure out

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.510
the largest possible clique that is in that network.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.160
It's going to be an easy example.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.580
Here you can check off these boxes and just make a check mark in each of the boxes

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.100
that belong to the largest clique.

00:00:16.100 --> 99:59:59.000
The largest set of vertices that are all connected to each other.
