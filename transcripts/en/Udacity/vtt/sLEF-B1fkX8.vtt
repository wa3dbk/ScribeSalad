00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.211
Now there's one more thing you have to do before we end this lesson. As I said

00:00:04.211 --> 00:00:08.593
before, it's really important to know how to use technology. And that's why we

00:00:08.593 --> 00:00:12.881
had you create a Google account, so that we can easily share real data with you

00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:17.319
to analyze. I asked all my co-workers here at Udacity how many Facebook friends

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:21.356
they have, and then I put this data for you in a spreadsheet. Open this

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:25.846
spreadsheet, and then copy and paste the data into a new spreadsheet. And then

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:30.413
try and find the average number of Facebook friends. I'll help you get started.

00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:34.844
In any of the blank cells, we always start our calclulations with an equals.

00:00:34.844 --> 00:00:39.880
There is already a built in function called average that calculates the average.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.704
See you can write this and the spread sheet software will recognize that you are

00:00:44.704 --> 00:00:49.461
going to take the average. Then in parenthesis write your start cell which is

00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:54.197
the letter and then the number that corresponds to the location of that cell.

00:00:54.197 --> 00:00:58.838
For example c32. Then you'll put a colon because you want to include all the

00:00:58.838 --> 00:01:03.230
cells in between the start cell and the end cell and then finish it off with

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.784
your end parentheses and then push enter or return. This should give you the

00:01:07.784 --> 00:01:12.517
average. Once you find it using the spread sheet tell us what you found. What's

00:01:12.517 --> 00:01:16.929
the average number of Facebook friends that my co-workers at Udacity have?
