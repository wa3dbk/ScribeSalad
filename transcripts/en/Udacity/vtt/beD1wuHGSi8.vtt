00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.969
Since passwords have problems and

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.600
we said that's only one of the ways
in which you can do authentication,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.860
let's look at some of the other ways
in which authentication can be done.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.471
So the second one was
something you have.

00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:15.840
So a token or a smart card or
something like that,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.060
obviously if it some thing you have,
then you must have it on them.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.861
If you don't have your token or your
smart card or your smartphone, if that's

00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:28.682
been used as the something you have,
you can't obviously access the system.

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:31.088
And people sometimes
forget these things and

00:00:31.088 --> 00:00:34.693
don't have them on them when they
need to access especially banks,

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:38.690
when they give you these tokens or send
you some sort of a code through them.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.040
If you don't have that with you,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.400
you're not going to be able
to access your account.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.300
So, not having them
would cause a problem.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.330
So you do have to have them that that's
one of the requirements when you

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.286
use this method.

00:00:50.286 --> 00:00:50.884
So obviously,

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:55.530
if it's something that you must have, it
should be able to talk to the system, or

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.130
the human has to enter the PIN or
whatever code that is sent to them.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.330
But if it's a smart card, the smart
card has to talk to the system,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.960
which requires you have to
have a reader, for example.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.370
You should be able to
swipe the smart card and

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.760
it should be able to communicate.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.150
So that adds the hardware
requirement which increases cost.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.790
Even if you have it at the other
end they should have a reader.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.010
If they don't have it then you
can't use it with that system.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.310
How is authentication implemented
with something you have?

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.580
If you have a smart card
we were just talking about,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.130
then it can talk to the system,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.670
then there could be some sort of
challenge/response kind of a thing.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.070
So the system can say, if you really
belong to the user that is being

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.930
claimed, or claim is being made about
the identity of a certain user then

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.430
that user's smart card
has a certain secret.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.740
Use that secret to sort of maybe
respond to my challenge, encrypt it or

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.170
something like that, or
do something to this challenge.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.000
And the response should demonstrate
that the secret that is stored

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.080
in this smart card is the one that
is used to generate the response.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.580
So, sometimes, if you have some
processing this smart card.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.020
Smart card can do this
sort of computation,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.538
generate a response that could be sent.

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:13.490
So this PIN and chip kind of cards,
the chip can do this kind of work, and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.600
that's how this would we implemented.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.960
The problem with this is that
there is added cost, and

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.360
of course sometimes there could be
misplaced trust in this kind of

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.330
tokens or cards that we're talking
about for something you have.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.630
There's of course the very well
known case of the RSA breach,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.810
where the master key was compromised.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.220
And as a result of that,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.920
all the SecureID tokens that RSA
stronger authentication relied on,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.710
you couldn't count on doing correct
authentication using those.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.460
So there's added cost we are talking
about but there's also vulnerabilities

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.990
or attacks that can limit
the strength that authentication,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.230
the stronger authentication that
these kind of tokens provide.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.180
So, something you have,
you don't need to remember those complex

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.120
passwords we're talking about, but
we need to be aware of the fact, and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.090
that they have their
own set of problems.
