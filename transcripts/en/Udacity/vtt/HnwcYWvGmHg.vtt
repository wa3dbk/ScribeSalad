00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.340
In the first iteration of GIFMaker,
you may have noticed this create and

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.770
save button on the preview screen.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.200
In this next iteration, we want that
button to do something, namely save and

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.730
persist GIFs.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.150
Here's what the new flow will look like.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.140
The app opens up to the welcome view
the first time a user opens the app.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.490
But from then on it opens up to
the saved gifts collection view.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.760
With the saved GIFs collection
view as our root view controller,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.860
we follow a flow similar to the first
iteration until we get to the preview

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.200
screen, where now the user
is able to save a GIF.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.920
Once a GIF has been saved,
it's added to this collection view.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.630
Eventually you can build up
a collection and persist the GIFs,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.130
such that when we close and relaunch
the app, our GIFs are still there.
