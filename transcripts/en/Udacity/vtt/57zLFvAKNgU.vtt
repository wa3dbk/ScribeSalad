00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.350
So there is, in fact, inheritable component to the development of bipolar, and

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.106
we see this in the fact that it tends to run in families. So, for instance, if

00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:12.034
a sibling or a parent has the disorder, it does increase the odds of anyone

00:00:12.034 --> 00:00:16.746
else in the family getting the disorder. But of course, again, this is by no

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:23.930
means inevitable. We also have to have an environmental aspect to the disorder.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.754
Fact in this case, exposure to alcohol while a fetus increases the odds of the

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:34.388
development of bi-polar. It also, in fact, increases the odds of depression,

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:39.832
schizophrenia, and alcoholism. So once again we see this complex interplay

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:44.868
between the forces of Nature, and the forces of n-, nurture. In the development

00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:47.060
of a disorder, and, in this case, bipolar.
