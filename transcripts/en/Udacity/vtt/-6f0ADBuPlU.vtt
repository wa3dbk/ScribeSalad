00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.310
In the case of full virtualization, the operating system thinks that it

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.090
owns all the devices already. And the way devices are virtualized, is the

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.230
familiar trap and emulate technique. That is for the devices

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.220
that the operating system thinks it owns when it tries to make

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.320
any access. To those devices, it's going to result in a trap into

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.850
the hyperviser and the hyperviser will emulate

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.650
the functionality that the Operating System intends for

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.800
that particular device. In this sense, there

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.390
is not much scope for innovation in the

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.790
way devices are virtualized in a fully

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.400
virtualized environment. A lots of details of course,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.810
that the hyperviser has to worry about,

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.700
once the guest. Trans into the hypervisor to

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.600
ensure the legality of the I/O operation and also whether the guest is allowed

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.220
to make those I/O operations and so on, but nothing fundamental conceptually.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.590
Is there in terms of device

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.390
virtualization in a fully virtualized environment. Para

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.820
virtualized setting is much more interesting. The IO devices seen by the guest

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.360
operating system are exactly the ones that

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.560
are available to the hypervisor. That is, the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.890
set of hardware devices That are available

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.110
in the platform are exactly the one that

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.269
the para-virtualized guest operating system is going

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:33.010
to be able to manipulate. This gives an

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.280
opportunity for innovating the interaction between the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.130
guest operating system and the hypervisor, in particular

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.935
ways in which we can make Device virtualization more efficient when we have this

00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:50.000
para-virtualized environment. So for one thing, it

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.250
is possible for the hypervisor to come up

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.920
with clean and simple device abstractions that

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.048
can be used by the para-virtualized operating

00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:02.570
system. Further, through APIs, it becomes possible

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.190
For the hypervisor to expose shared buffers to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.740
the guest operating system. So that efficiently

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.530
data can be passed between the guest

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.930
operating system and the hypervisor and to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.740
the devices without incurring the overhead of

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.600
copying multiple times data from one address

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.360
space into another. And similarly, there can

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.340
be innovations in the way event delivery

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.460
happens between the hypervisor and the guest

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.180
operating system. So, in order to do

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.380
device virtualization, we have to worry about two

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.590
things. One is how to transfer control

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.200
back and forth between the hypervisor and the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.580
guest. Because, devices being hardware entities They

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.550
need manipulation by the hypervisor in a privileged

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.370
state. And there is a data transfer that needs to be done because the hypervisor

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.890
is in a different protection domain compared to the guest operating system.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.860
So these are two things that one has to worry about in

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.070
device virtualization and we'll see how both control transfer. And data transfer

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.870
at accomplished in both the fully virtualized and the para virtualized settings.
