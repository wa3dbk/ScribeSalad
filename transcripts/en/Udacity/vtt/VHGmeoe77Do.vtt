00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.160
Before we talk about how to move on
to high fidelity prototypes, and

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.290
bring new people in on the creation
process, I want to step back for

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.770
a moment and
talk about what you can now do.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.780
You've learned the fundamentals
of an iterative process for

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.820
making a better prototype.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.900
By repeating this cycle, you will arrive
at a great prototype for a great app.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.940
And you'll accrue feedback,
both positive and negative.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.320
Also, remember from the product design
course, you may use your design sprint

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.850
skills to create new features or
parts of your product.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.350
We've only gone along with you for
two iterations of this process, and

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.780
it's important to give yourself
room to iterate, learn and grow.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.930
Many great apps went through 5, 10,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.785
15 cycles of this process
before being built.

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:41.520
These cycles of prototyping
allow you to fail quickly and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.090
get those bad designs out of the way.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.670
Remember that every time
you go through cycle,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.090
there are a few steps
you need to follow.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.650
Define what information
you are looking to find.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.990
Modify your current prototype to match
whatever feedback you've already gotten.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.520
Put your prototype in front
of three to five users.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.140
Collect their feedback.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.850
And then analyze the feedback to see
whether you got the right information.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.030
As you get better at this process,
you'll benefit from learning more tools

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.870
in order to build the right prototype
for the right step in the process.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.380
We'll spend the next few videos
talking about those tools.
