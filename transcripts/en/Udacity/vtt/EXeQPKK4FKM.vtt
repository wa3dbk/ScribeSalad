00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.755
When you substituted in for p, you should have gotten negative 11, 1 and

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:11.274
negative 11 for solutions. Since we found that f of negative 2 is negative, and

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:16.111
f of 0 is positive, then we can conclude that the function has a 0 between

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:23.104
negative 2 and 0. And likewise, between f of 0 and f of 2.
