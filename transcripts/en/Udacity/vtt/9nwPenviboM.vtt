00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.520
The Promise object is used for
deferred and asynchronous computations.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.820
Okay, great.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.870
This statement is less than helpful
if you're understanding of the word

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.410
asynchronous is less than certain.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.190
So, the question is,
what is asynchronous work?

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.590
Asynchronous work happens at
an unknown or unpredictable time.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.900
Normally code is synchronise.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.950
One statement executes, like this one,
and there's a guarantee that

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.590
the next statement executes
immediately afterwards.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.020
Threading on processors doesn't
necessarily guarantee that, however,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.860
the JavaScript threading model
ensures that for all intents and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.730
purposes, JavaScript runs
in a single timeline.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.540
Unlike synchronise code.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.630
Asynchronous code is not guaranteed to
execute in a single unbroken timeline.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.780
In fact,
you should assume that you have no idea

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.680
when asynchronous
operations will complete.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.440
In a situation like this, for example,
you can't even assume that just because

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.630
you sent out the first request first and
the second request second,

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.650
that the first request will
return sooner than the second.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.780
Assume that either order is equally
likely, as the fact that one or

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.650
both requests just
might fail altogether.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.670
Network requests aren't the only
examples of asynchronous code.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.380
Any code that relies on processes like
these, like events, like threads, or

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.450
just some kind of unknowable
finishing time are asynchronous.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.480
So, the big question is, what is the
best way to handle asynchronous code?

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.830
Okay, the answer is obviously promises.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.430
That's why you're here.
