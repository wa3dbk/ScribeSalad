00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's go through 1 possible answer together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're assigning to the variable, regexp, a regular expression.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Those start with r and then double quotes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The first thing I want to do is match the function name. That will be [a - z]+.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now I want to match immediately an opening parenthesis.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I will escape that opening parenthesis just to make sure that it works.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now I can possibly have spaces or not,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so I could have 0 or more spaces, so I'll leave a space

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and then put a star.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The star will refer back to the space, and we can have 0 or more of these.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Then there's a numerical argument--1 or more digits--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and then more space, 0 or more, more spaces.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I close off the parenthesis, escaping the closed parenthesis just to make sure.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.870
Now I'm done, and this regular expression works well in practice.
