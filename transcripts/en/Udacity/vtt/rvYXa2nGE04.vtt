00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.290
Okay, this might sound a bit strange but

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.140
imagine you're building a user interface
for screen reading users only.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.730
So you don't need to create
any visual UI at all.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.440
Just provide enough information for
the screen reader to use.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.700
How would you express the form interface
we used in the previous exercise?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.710
Well, what you'd be creating is kind of
an API describing the page structure.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.790
That sounds kind of like the dom API.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.570
But we can get away with less
information and fewer nodes.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.380
Because a lot of that information is
useful only for visual presentation.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.130
Sorry, something like this.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.300
This enables a screen reader user to
jump in between high level sections and

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.820
then get enough information about
each form element's affordances

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.340
to know how to fill them in.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.080
Remember, for a screen reader user, the
screen reader provides the affordances

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.740
based on the role alone without
caring about the visual style.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.330
This is more or

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.740
less what the browser actually
does present to the screen reader.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.960
What happens is that the browser
takes the DOM tree and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.720
modifies it to turn it into a form which
is useful to assistive technology.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.130
We refer to this modified tree
as the accessibility tree.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.580
In my mind, the accessibility tree
conceptually looks a bit like

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.750
an HTML page from the 90s.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.980
You may have seen web
pages that look like this.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.634
You can picture the mark up, I'm sure.

00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:18.311
A few carefully chosen images,
a lot of links, a text box and a button.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:21.763
Visually scanning down the page in this
case gives you an experience pretty

00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:23.970
similar to what a screen
reader user would get.
