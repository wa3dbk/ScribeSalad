00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.059
Now let's say you had a phobia of snakes, and your therapist going to use

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:09.218
systematic desensitization. First you learn the relaxation techniques, then

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:13.244
your therapist starts pairing the relaxation techniques with snake-related

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:17.857
stimuli. Now I want you to place the level of exposure you are about to see on

00:00:17.857 --> 00:00:21.553
a hierarchy that you would expect therapist to use when gradually exposing you

00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:28.684
to a snake. Seeing a picture of a snake in a terrarium, seeing a real snake in

00:00:28.684 --> 00:00:35.268
a terrarium across the room. Holding a snake, seeing the word snake in print,

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:42.241
seeing a picture of someone holding a snake. Hearing the word snake, imagining

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:48.522
a snake, and seeing someone hold a snake from across the room. Write a letter

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:51.882
in each one of these boxes that goes from the least exposure, so the first

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:55.298
things that you'd be exposed to to get rid of your snake phobia, to the most

00:00:55.298 --> 00:01:00.402
exposure. For example, this would be the last day of your therapy and you are

00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:02.410
no longer scared of snakes.
