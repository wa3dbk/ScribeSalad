00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.950
At this point,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.150
we could perhaps make updates to our model that increase its accuracy.

00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:09.670
Its accuracy is quite high at this point.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.660
And it would probably be more fruitful to consider new questions all

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.480
together that our analysis has opened up.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.700
For example, how well is this model generalized to other users of Twitter?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.820
Can we classify Twitter users into different classes distinguished by

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.910
which type of model characterizes their tweeting habits.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.920
We've made a model that predicts time to next tweet overall, but

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.820
can we now build a predictor for time to tweet about a specific subject.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.200
As you can see,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.060
our analysis is opened up the room to many possible new investigations.
