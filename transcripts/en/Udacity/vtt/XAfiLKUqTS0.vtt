00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.035
Let's do 1 last example using sum and difference of cubes. If we have the

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:08.150
expression 125Z cubed minus 1, how can we factor this? Remember that the

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.242
variables that we picked in the initial original equations are just place

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:16.391
holders. It does not matter that we're using the variable Z here and that

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:20.484
there's 1 present over here. All that matters in a given expression is the

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:24.417
relationship of the 2 terms to one another. The fact that this variable and this

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:27.617
variable happen to have the same name does not mean that they are necessarily

00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:28.160
connected.
