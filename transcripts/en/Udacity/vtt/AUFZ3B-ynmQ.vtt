We need to start off with our new equation for g, the total number of gallons

00:00:05.645 --> 00:00:11.493
that Grant is going to buy. Since n stands for the number of orders that Grant

00:00:10.892 --> 00:00:16.899
is expecting to get, we need to substitute 550 in the spot of n. Then, we just

00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:22.750
need to simplify the right-hand side of the equation, to solve for g. 55 plus 20

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:25.243
is 75. So, the answer is 75 gallons.
