Let's do one more. Have you ever left your house with your umbrella thinking

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.533
it's going to rain but then it doesn't? And then you just end up carrying your

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:11.596
umbrella around all day? Let's say that the null hypothesis is that it's not

00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:16.416
going to rain and the alternative hypothesis is that it will rain. Now we're

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:20.676
going to do kind of the opposite from what we did the last quiz. This time,

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:26.538
decide which of these correspond to rejecting the null or retaining the null.

00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:32.110
Or, if the null true or the null is false.. Write A, B, C, or D in each of

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.990
these boxes. Just to clarify a little more, if the null is true, which of

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:44.232
these, A, B, C, or D, corresponds to that. If we decided to retain each H

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:48.750
naught, in other words we decided that it's not going to rain, which one of

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.294
these, A, B, C, or D, should go in this box?
