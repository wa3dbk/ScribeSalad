00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.372
There are two solutions for any given quadratic equation. Let's think back to

00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:08.648
how this emerges from the quadratic formula. It comes out of the presence of

00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:13.136
this plus or minus here in the numerator. This is going to give us two answers,

00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:17.538
negative b plus the square root of b squared minus four a c all over two a, and

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:21.940
then the same thing except for a minus sign in between the negative b and the

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.617
rest of the numerator. This also makes sense if we look at the general form for

00:00:26.617 --> 00:00:31.221
a quadratic equation as well. We have ax squared plus bx plus c equals 0 and in

00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:35.455
order to end up with a term involving an x squared in it, because we know that

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:39.959
the coefficient a is not allowed to equal 0. We need to be able to multiply 2

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:44.495
things together that have a factor of x in them, since that's the only way you

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:49.123
can get an x squared down here. That means that either of these factors needs to

00:00:49.123 --> 00:00:53.044
be able to be set equal to 0 and give us both solutions. So there are 2

00:00:53.044 --> 00:00:53.756
solutions.
