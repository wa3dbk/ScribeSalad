00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:03.510
Let's talk a little bit more about phases. The rational unified

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.050
process phases are fundamental aspects of this process and which just touched

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.200
on them so we just give a quick overview. And I want to

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.010
look at these phases in a little more detail. So, what I'm

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.960
going to do is, for each phase, I'm going to discuss what it is,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.310
what it produces and how is the result of the phase suppose

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.910
to be,. Assessed, and what are the consequences of this assessment. So

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.350
let's start with the first phase, the inception phase. The first phase

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.920
goes from the idea of the product to the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.990
vision of the end product. What this involves is basically

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.230
to delimiting the project scope. And making the business case

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.040
for the product presented. Why is it worth doing? What

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.870
are the success criteria? What are the main risks? What

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.690
resources will be needed? And so on, specifically these phases

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.310
answer three main questions. The first one is, what are

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.330
the major users or actors, to use the UML terminology.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.450
And what will the system do for them? To

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.780
answer this, these phases produce a simplified use-case model where

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.480
only a few use-cases are represented and described. So this

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.390
is a sort of initial use-case model. The second question

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.610
is about the architecture, what could be an architecture

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.370
for the system? So in this phase we will normally

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.420
also develop a tentative architecture. So an initial architecture that

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.540
describes the most crucial subsystems. Finally this phase also answers

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.890
the question, what is the plan and how much

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.620
will it cost? To answer this question. This phase will

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.930
identify the main risks for the project and also produce

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.600
a rough plan with estimates for resources, initial planning for

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.820
the phases and dates and milestones. Specifically, the inception phase

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.370
generates several deliverables. It is very important that you pay

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.600
attention so that you understand what this deliberate approach are.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.320
Starting from the first one, which is the vision document.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.800
And this is a document that provides a general

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.420
vision of the core projects requirements, key features and main

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.890
constraints. Together with this, the inception phase also produces an

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.900
initial use case model, as I just mentioned. So this

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.720
is a use case model that includes an initial set

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.670
of use cases, and then will be later refined. Two

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.300
additional variables are the initial project glossary, which describes the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.330
main terms, using the project and their meaning, and the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.229
initial business case which includes business context. And

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.470
success criteria. Yet another deliverable for the inception phase

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.770
is the initial project plan, which shows the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.650
phases, iterations, roles of the participants, schedule and initial

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.610
estimates. In addition, the inception phase also produces

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.810
a risk assessment document, which describes the main risks

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.970
and counters measures for this risk. Finally, and this

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.430
is an optional deliverable, in the sense that it,

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.990
it might or might not be produced, depending on the specific

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.870
project. As part of the inception phase we might also generate

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.780
1 or more prototypes. For example, we might develop prototypes to

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.590
address some specific risks that we have identified or to show some

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.380
specific aspect of the system of which we are unsure to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.910
the stakeholders. So basically all the typical users of prototypes that

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.600
we discussed before. So when we're done with the inception phase

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.300
we hit the first milestone for the cycle we are currently performing.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.600
And so there are some evaluation criteria that will tell

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.640
us whether we can consider the inception phase concluded or not.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.840
And the first of this criteria is stakeholder concurrence, which

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.510
means that all the stakeholders must agree on the scope, definition,

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.510
and cost schedule estimates for the projects. The second criteria

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.040
needs requirements understanding, out of the initial primary use cases that

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.380
we have identified so far, the right one for our system.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.760
And other criteria is the credibility of the cost schedule estimates,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.280
the priorities, defined the risks identifies and the countermeasures for

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.590
those risks, and the development process that we're following. Finally, in

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.000
the case we produce prototypes as part of the inceptional

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.520
phase, this will also be evaluated and assessed to judge the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.960
overall outcome of the phase. So what happens if the

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.170
project fails to pass this milestone? So if the outcome of

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.020
the inception phase is considered to be inadequate with respect

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.642
to one or more of these criteria. Well at this point,

00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:51.240
since we're kind of an initial phase of the cycle

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.370
the project may be cancelled or considerably re-thought. So to

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.610
summarize all of these in one sentence the Inception Phase

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.320
is the phase in which we produce. Then you shall vision,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.750
used case model, project plan, risk assessment and possibly, prototypes

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.290
for the project. And we have to make sure, that

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.680
all of this deliverables satisfy a set of criteria, so

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.770
that we can continue on the project. And otherwise, we'll either

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.160
cancel the project or rethink its scope, or other aspects of it.
