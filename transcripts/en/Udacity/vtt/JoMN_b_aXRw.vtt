00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.740
What approach is a window based [UNKNOWN]?

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.640
In this approach, a sender can only have

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.230
a certain number of packets outstanding or

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.470
quote, in flight. And the sender uses acknowledgement

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.800
from the receiver to clock the retransmission

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.330
of new data. So let's suppose that the

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.920
sender's window was four packets. At this point,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.590
there are four packets outstanding in the network.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.240
And the sender cannot send additional packets,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.020
until it has received an acknowledgement from the

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.370
receiver. When it recieves an acknoweldgemnt on ACK

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.800
from the reciever. The sender, can then, send

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.660
another packet. So at this point there are

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.910
still four outstanding or four unacknowledged packets in

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.560
flight. In this case if a sender wants

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.390
to increase the rate at which it's sending,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.840
it simply needs to increase the window size. So for example, if the sender wants

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.450
to send at a faster rate, it can increase the window size from four, to five.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.370
A sender might increase it's rate anytime it sees an

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.350
acknowledgement from the receiver. In TCP every time a sender

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.450
receives an acknowledgement, it increases the window size. Upon a successful

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.660
receipt, we want the sender to increase its window

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.840
by one packet per round trip. So for example in this case, if the sender's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.321
window was initially four packets, then at the end,of

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:37.540
a single round trip's worth of sending, we want the next

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.960
set of transmissions to allow five packets to be outstanding;

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.700
this is call Additive Increase. If a packet is not acknowledged, the window

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.940
size is reduced by half, this is

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.170
called Multiplicative Decrease. So TCP's congestion control

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.400
is called additive increase multiplicative decrease,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.750
or AIMD. The other approach to adjusting

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.860
rates is an explicit rate-based congest control

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.270
album. In this case the sender monitors

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.210
the loss rate and uses a timer to modulate the transmission rate. Window based

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.950
congestion controal, or AIMD, is the common

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.490
way of performing congestion control in today's

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.990
computer networks. In the next lesson we will talk about the two goals of

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.460
TCP congestion control further, efficiency and fairness.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.140
And explore how TCP achieves those goals.
