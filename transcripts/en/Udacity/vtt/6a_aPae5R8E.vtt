00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It turns out it doesn't really depend on whether the graph

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is done through sparse that's captured in M.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Right. So if the M is dense that means it's sort of order in squared. If it's sparse, it's lower n.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So what have we already captured in terms of n and M, so it's not that one.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It depends on the degree or amount--it turns out we're going to have to do the same amount of work

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
if there's nodes that have very, very high degree or if there's nodes that have very, very low degree.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We still end up having to do a certain amount of work for each edge.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It doesn't matter how to clump the nodes--it matters how many they are total.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's this one--it depends on how "find shortest" is implemented.
