00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.997
Let's talk about signs for a second. For real numbers, we have 3 different

00:00:03.997 --> 00:00:07.882
cases. Every real number is either negative, 0, or positive. Now since

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:12.106
discriminants are made of real numbers, assuming that the coefficients of our

00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:16.475
quadratic equation are real, then they had to fall into these 3 categories. Each

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:21.031
of these types of discriminants matches a certain number of roots Of a parabola,

00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:25.315
or in other words, a certain number of solutions to our quadratic equation,

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:29.937
which we can of course find by our quadratic formula, using the disciminate. So

00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:34.353
here are 3 types of discriminates, and which type do you think produces 2 real

00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:38.838
roots, which type do you think produces 1 real root, and which type do you think

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.363
produces no real roots?
