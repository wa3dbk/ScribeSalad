00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.210
With the help of jQuery selectors, you can select specific elements of the DOM.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.320
But, what if you wanted all the children of this div?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.290
How would you find them?

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.790
Alternatively, what if you selected this div, but

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.620
you wanted to inspect its parent element, this div?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.900
How would you find it?

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.410
jQuery gives us DOM traversal methods for moving around the DOM tree.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.952
I'll start with parent.

00:00:24.952 --> 00:00:27.930
If I've selected the node with the ID Cameron,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.781
I can select my immediate parent by calling .parent.

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:32.835
Dot parent goes up the DOM one level, so

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:36.960
at this point I've selected the element with the ID Mark Suzanne.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.450
I could use .parents to select my parents, my grandparents, and

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.010
my great grandparents.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.970
I could also filter for

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.040
a specific parent by passing in another selector to the parents method.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.400
Say, for instance, I just wanted my grandparents, JerryJudy, I could pass

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.780
JerryJudy with a pound sign into parents and then only have this node selected.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.170
It's important to note that parent will only go up a single level on the tree.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.920
If you need to go up more than just one level you need to use .parents; which

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.980
will go all the way up to top of the DOM tree.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.087
I could go down the DOM too and select my children using .children.

00:01:13.087 --> 00:01:17.770
Dot children creates a jQuery collection of all of my immediate children,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.810
meaning that they're one level down in the DOM.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.180
But if I wanted my children's children, or any children of Taylor and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.250
Grant, if they existed in this example, I would have to use .find.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.110
Dot find goes down the DOM more than one level.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.450
Similar to parent and parents, jQuery provides a method that

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.300
only traverses a single level deep in the tree, which is called .children.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.070
If you want to go deeper, there's a separate method called .find which will go

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.350
many levels down on the DOM tree.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.490
Finally, there's .siblings.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.640
Dot siblings returns a jQuery collection of all of my siblings,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.380
meaning that we've got the same parent.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.670
In this case, Max and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.210
I both have the same parent so calling .siblings would return Max.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.180
And once again, I can pass a selector into siblings if I

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.990
need to get more specific with my selection.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.240
Now, I want you to try out all of these DOM traversal methods with a quiz.
