00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.870
We earlier discussed quality measures,
and now you'll see why.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.480
Providers demonstrate that they have
achieved Meaningful Use Stage One

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.970
by submitting measures in three
categories, core measures,

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.830
menu set measures, and
clinical quality measures.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.240
There are 15 mandatory core measures.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.831
Providers must also submit
five of ten menu set measures,

00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:30.020
as well as six clinical
quality measures.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.790
Three of these are mandatory, and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.079
providers can select the other
three from a list of 41.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.200
The core measures are divided
into the four groups shown here.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.010
Improve quality, safety, and efficiency,
and reduce health disparities.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.510
Engage patients and families.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.150
Improve care coordination and
privacy and security.
