00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Thrun] And here is my solution. We have 4 cases.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
On the left side, if I'm on the left side of the racecourse,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as defined that x is smaller to radius,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
then my crosstrack_error is defined by the distance to the circle,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
centered at radius comma radius minus the radius itself.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So this is going to be 0 if I'm exactly on the circle.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If I'm more than 3 times over to the right side, I get a circle again.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It looks like the one before, but now the center of the circle is a little bit further to the right

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
by 3 times radius as opposed to 1 radius.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The rest is identical to the line over here,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
so I'm subtracting the same radius on the right side.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You can't quite see it but it's there.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Interesting are the straightaways.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So if my y value is large on the upper part of the diagram--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
in fact, it's larger than radius--then my crosstrack_error is the y coordinate

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
times 2 times the radius, which is the height of the racetrack.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If I'm down at the bottom, it's just the y axis,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but really important is the minus sign because I'm moving in the opposite direction.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So for your code, to run this correctly you would have gotten everything in this routine right.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So that finishes my homework assignment.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Congratulations. You were able to make a car drive on a racetrack.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That is actually quite a significant component of making cars drive.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The PID control methodology that you learned today

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and the smoothing methodology are really, really essential

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
not just in controlling self-driving cars but in a great number of other control setups.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Thank you for taking the class so far. You learned a lot already.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You learned about localization, about planning and control,

00:01:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and we almost learned talking about how to build a self-driving car.
