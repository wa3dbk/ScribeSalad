00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.333
First I'm going to talk about networks in general. The

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:06.240
internet is just a special kind of network. There are lots

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.780
of different ways to define a network. We are going to

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.152
use quite a precise definition. So we are going to define

00:00:11.152 --> 00:00:13.680
a network as a group of entities. And entities could be

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.330
people, they could be computers, they could be organizations, they could

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.980
be governments, that can communicate, even though they're not all directly

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.930
connected. So here's an example to show what that definition means.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.810
So we have Alice. And we have Bob.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.060
And Alice and Bob know each other, and can

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.670
talk to each other. The way they talk, we can

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.540
call the channel. That could be just talking in

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.790
person. That could be talking over a telephone. We're going to

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.980
say that just this is not enough to be

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.370
a network. This is just two people having a conversation.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.140
If we had the second scenario, we'll say we have

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.300
Alice, Bob and Charlie. And Alice can communicate with Bob.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.160
Bob can communicate with Charlie. And Charlie can communicate

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.870
with Alice. But they can do all this directly. They're

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.540
all directly connected. If Alice wants to talk to

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.060
Charlie, well, she has a direct link to Charlie. She

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.180
doesn't need to use Bob. There's no way to

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.910
communicate other than across these direct links. So even in

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.880
this case where there are three people who can all

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.370
communicate we're still going to say that's not a network.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.070
Many people would call both of these networks. We're going

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.830
to use a somewhat more precise definition where neither of these

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.860
will be considered a network. What will be considered a

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.080
network is this third example and in the third example we

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.400
have three nodes. We have Alice, Bob, and Charlie let's

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.400
say. They're the three people but now Alice is not directly

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.110
connected to Charlie. But there's a way that Alice can

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.880
send a message to Charlie. And she can send the message,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.840
because Bob will forward the message for

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.390
her. Once the message goes through two hops,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.780
to make it so two people are not

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.460
directly connected, can communicate. And maybe Charlie can

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.060
also send messages back to Alice. Then we call it a network. So that's going to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.270
be our definition. There has to be at least three entities and there has to be

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.150
a way that entities that are not

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.100
directly connected can still communicate. So to see

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.640
that you understand that definition of a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.830
network and maybe also know a little bit

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.320
of world history we're going to have a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.350
quiz. So here are the possible answers. Ten

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.280
years old, 30 years old, 100 years old, 1000 years old, or over 3000 years old.
