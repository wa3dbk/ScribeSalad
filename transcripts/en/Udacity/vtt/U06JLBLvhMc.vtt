00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.670
Here's another principle by Robert Martin,

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.170
called the Interface Segregation Principle. Robert Martin developed this,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.950
principle, which suggests that clients depend on an interface to

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.335
a part of a large class's features rather than directly on the large class.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:20.120
Note the relationship of this principle to role-based design that we discussed

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.440
earlier in the course. In role based design, classes are synthesised from

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.580
interfaces each of which reflect a role that objects of that class might play.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.930
The implication of this principle, like that of role based design,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.230
is that class interfaces should be broken into small pieces,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.270
each corresponding to a single use case.
