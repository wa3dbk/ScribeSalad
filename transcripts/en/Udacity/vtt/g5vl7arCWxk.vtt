00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.590
The first question that popped to your mind whenever we suggest a solution

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.840
approach is why? In particular, whose pain point are we trying to

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.040
solve? It turns out that many operating system's subsystems need

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.210
persistence. For example file system, it has metadata

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.530
such as inodes that say where and how files are actually

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.870
stored on the disc. And this data structure, which

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.210
is the inode data structure, is a persistent data

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.070
structure and while the operating system may manipulate that

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.640
data structure by bringing it into main memory for performance

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.120
reasons. Finally, it has to put it back on

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.490
the disk in a persistent state once permanent changes have

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.740
been made to that data structure. And that's the

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.732
reason why persistence is very, very important for building several

00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:52.660
such subsystems. So, a file system I gave

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.300
you as an example. Similarly runtime systems of

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.770
many languages may require support for persistent objects

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.709
that need to be stored on permanent storage.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:10.310
And all of these subsystems, what they would do is in order to make it efficient

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.390
from the point of view of your processing,

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.910
they will have in memory a cache copy of

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.050
the persistent data that lives on permanent

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.070
storage such as the disk. But, if and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.510
when changes are made to those data structures that are in memory, they have to

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.310
be committed back to the permanent storage

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.240
so that there is consistency for actions that

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.710
are being taken by these subsystems. So how

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.640
can we provide persistent support for these subsystems?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.030
Well, one possibility is to make virtual

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.190
memory persistent, because if you make the virtual

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.305
memory system persistent then all the data

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:51.600
structures that are contained in the virtual memory

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.770
become automatically persistent. Now the upshot of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.800
doing that would be that the subsystems do

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.660
not have to worry about flushing the

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.010
persistent data structures from memory into the disk

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.139
because some other layer in the software stack is

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.600
going to take care of it if in fact

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.440
we make virtual memory persistent. That also means that

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.370
if the system were to crash either due to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.966
power failure or due to problems in the software,

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:25.430
meaning software bugs, recovering from such crashes becomes easy

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.780
because the data structures are persistent and anything that

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.020
was done in the virtual memory of the process

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.030
that represents that subsystem is going to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.170
be available in the persistent storage. The question

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.970
is then, who will use it? Well,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.820
we are expecting that the subsystem designers will

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.250
use such an abstraction if we provide

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.290
it. But subsystem designers also care about performance.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.200
And therefore, subsystem designers will use it

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.650
only if the abstraction is a performant abstraction.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.150
In other words, it is not enough to come up with an abstraction, but it is

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.950
also important to make the abstraction efficient. So

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.730
if an abstraction is cheap to use, easy

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.880
to understand, and flexible, then subsystem designers will

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.950
use it. If it is not, they won't.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.440
So the question is, if we want to

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.820
make virtual memory persistent, can we also make

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.560
it an efficient implementation of the abstraction

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.680
of a persistent virtual memory? Now how can

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.495
we make it efficient? Now if we think about it, the virtual address base of a

00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:36.008
process, and let's say that this virtual address

00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:38.970
space represents a process that belongs to a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.580
particular subsystem. It may have persistent data structures

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.720
that are strewn all over this address space.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.560
And if these data structures, persistent data structures,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.510
are written into and if these persistent data structures

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.070
are manipulated by the subsystem and if we want

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.810
them to be committed to the storage, then it

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.552
requires that every time we touch a persistent data

00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:06.195
structure in-memory version of it and modify it, the

00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:09.380
on-disk version of that same data structure needs to

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.740
be updated. Now what that means is if these

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.380
data structures are spread out all over the

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.355
virtual address space, that could result in many

00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:21.709
I/O operations, first of all. Second, it could

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.290
also mean that we may be writing, to

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.920
different portions of the disk. And both of

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.880
these are bad news, because disk by it's

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.690
very nature, it's electromechanical in nature. And, disk

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.080
is electromechanical in nature. And as a result there

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.940
are latencies associated with the disc, namely,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.900
seek latency and rotational latency. And if the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.540
writing that we are doing to virtual

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.005
memory, which is backed up by the persistent

00:04:52.005 --> 00:04:58.560
disk, is all over the disk, then it's going to result in many random writes

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.060
to the storage system. And random writes are

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.860
going to be resulting in very poor performance.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.030
So instead of doing this, what we would like to do is have what we will

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:16.160
call a log segment. And the idea is very similar to the log structure file

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.960
system that we have seen earlier when we discussed XFS. The idea is that, when

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.610
you're making changes to the virtual memory and

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.250
you know what portions of it are persistent,

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.140
every time you write to a persistent data structure

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.130
that is in memory, then you write a log

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.100
record that corresponds to the change that you made

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.820
to the persistent data structure. So this is the

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.350
change you made to this persistent data structure, and

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.680
this is the change you made to this persistent

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.320
data structure. The log segment is itself a data

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.390
structure in support of these subsystems when implementing the

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.220
persistent virtual memory. We have this log segment

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.370
as a data structure that the implementation uses to

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.850
record changes to persistent portions of the virtual address

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.530
space. And because we are putting it into this

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.814
data structure called log segment, we can write this

00:06:09.814 --> 00:06:13.520
contiguously. And of course, we have to commit these

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.000
changes to the disk. But now you can see

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.280
the difference in the picture between here and here.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.080
Here we were doing random writes all over the

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.100
disk. But here we are writing the changes to

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.140
the persistent data structures to contiguous portions of a

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.400
log segment and we can take this and store this

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.610
contiguously on the disk, and that's the attraction. So

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.210
these log segments are going to be stored contiguously

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.950
on the disk. And therefore, even though we are

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.600
making random writes in the address space of the subsystem

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.420
that we are building that requires certain persistent

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.990
data structures, because those changes are being recorded as

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.940
logs in a log segment, and we are committing the log segment to the disk we can

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.052
convert these random writes to sequential writes and

00:07:01.052 --> 00:07:04.040
write sequentially on the disk. So two things we

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.590
are accomplishing by doing that. The first is

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.730
we are not making individual I/O operations for every

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.450
time we touch different portions of the virtual address

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.730
space, because we are writing it into this log segment,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.890
which may be an in-memory data structure. And therefore,

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.100
we are reducing the number of I/O operations that we

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.020
need in order to commit these changes finally to

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.250
the storage. And second because we are writing this contiguously,

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.960
we don't have the random writes that we talked

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.090
about. All of this, will help make the design and

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.810
implementation of a persistent virtual memory much more

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.970
efficient. That is the key idea, which is

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.740
there in the paper that I've assigned to

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.070
you for reading, which is the LRVM paper.
