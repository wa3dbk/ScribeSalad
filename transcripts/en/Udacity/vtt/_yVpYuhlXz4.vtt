00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.300
This equation really represents a hyperbola. And it opens up and down. Nice

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.766
thinking if you got that correct. Now remember, we want to get the x squared

00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:15.070
and y squared term on the same side of the equation. So, I'm going to subtract

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.234
2x squared from both sides of the equation. This will leave us with 18 on the

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:25.203
right, and 2y squared minus 2x squared on the left. Since we have a subtraction

00:00:25.203 --> 00:00:28.161
sign between the y squared and the x squared term, we know the conic is a

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:32.902
hyperbola. And since this y squared term comes first, we know that our

00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:38.588
hyperbola opens up and it opens down. We can put this equation into the general

00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:43.591
form that we recognize, by dividing each term by 18. We'll have y squared

00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:48.260
divided by 9 minus x squared divided by 9 equals 1. And just to be sure, I can

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.068
show you that each of these equations represent the same exact hyperbola. The

00:00:53.068 --> 00:00:55.740
equations are just written in different forms.
