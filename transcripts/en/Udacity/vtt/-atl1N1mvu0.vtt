00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Evans] These are our 3 big themes in the class:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
abstraction, universality, and recursive definitions.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What I want to do now is look at various things that we've covered throughout the course

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and see how they fit in to these 3 main themes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In Unit 1 we introduced the concept of variables.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We can use a name to refer to some value.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So that's definitely a type of abstraction.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It allowed us to use the name x to refer to different things.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's helpful for universality, but by itself it doesn't really provide us that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And it's not really a recursive definition, although we can define variables

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in terms of other variables.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In Unit 2 we introduced procedures.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
A procedure is definitely a kind of abstraction.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
By making the parameter to a procedure, we can have code that we write once

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that does many different things,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and we can hide all those details when we use the procedure.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Procedures also give us a form of universality.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We can use the same procedure to do many different things,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we can define procedures to do everything, as we've seen.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We didn't really understand that yet in Unit 2, though, but it is enough

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to define every possible computer program.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We certainly use procedures to make recursive definitions,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and we've certainly defined recursive procedures--not until Unit 6, though.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And this gives us a way to define a procedure to break a problem down

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
by seeing it in terms of a smaller version of itself.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The main new thing in Unit 3 was lists.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is a kind of data abstraction.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You can use a list without knowing the details of how Python implements a list.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It also can be a recursive definition.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We can have lists that have elements that are other lists,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so it certainly is useful for recursive definitions.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And it's universal in the sense that we can put any element we want in a list.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So in Unit 4 the main things we did were finish the search index

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
by providing a way to produce an index of data.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This certainly involved a lot of abstraction.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We found a way to represent the data from the web pages in an index

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and respond to queries.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The other thing we talked about in Unit 4 was how networks work.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Networks are all about abstraction.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We want to find ways to make requests

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
where we're thinking about what we're requesting as a web page.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
All the details of how we actually do that are hidden,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and unless we need to worry about that, it's much better to think about that abstractly

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
as this is sending a request for a web page.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
In Unit 5 the main new idea we introduced was how to measure cost.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
That's a kind of abstraction.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We want to measure cost in terms of understanding how the cost scales

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
with the size of the input rather than the details of the cost.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's also related to universality.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Understanding the cost of a procedure depends on having a fairly universal model

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
of computing.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We want to understand how much a given algorithm costs

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
without depending on the details of how our particular computer works.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And then we introduced the hash table.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This was a kind of data abstraction.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It was universal in the sense that it could contain any kind of element as its values.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
We didn't define it recursively.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We could certainly have hash tables containing other hash tables,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and we have dictionaries of dictionaries,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
so this also certainly has aspects of recursive definitions in place.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And finally, in Unit 6 the main big idea was recursive procedures.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Obviously, that fits in to our theme of recursive definitions.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It also relates to universality.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We showed how to make code that runs forever

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
or keeps on going as long as it needs to

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
without using a while loop, so that gives some support for the idea

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
that all we really need are procedures, if, and a way to keep track of things

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
to be able to define every computer program.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We saw that any program that we could write as a recursive procedure

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we could also write as a while loop.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So if you've followed everything that we've done in this class,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
you've really learned an amazing amount.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And as you learn more and more about computing,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
you'll see these 3 themes of abstraction, universality,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and recursive definitions all over the place.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But you've already seen them many, many times just in the units of this course.
