00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.460
Let's take an example
site like udacity.com and

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.460
imagine that I am a user who has
difficulty reading small print.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.400
Now naturally, one thing I may do to
help with this is to zoom the page.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.837
So let's go ahead and we'll just
zoom this page up to about 400%.

00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:19.255
Now an interesting thing
is going to happen,

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:23.730
we're now viewing the mobile
version of the site on our desktop.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.890
Because the page was
designed responsively,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.300
the UI has rearranged itself for
the smaller viewport.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.350
Which is great for desktop users
who require screen magnification,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.340
and it's great for

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.030
mobile screen reader users since there
are fewer elements to touch and explore.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.929
This is just a total win, in fact, just
by designing responsively we're meeting

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.490
rule 1.4.4 of the WebAIM checklist.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.959
Which states that a page
should be readable and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:51.090
functional when the text
size is doubled.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.005
Now going over all of responsive design
is way outside the scope of this course.

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.735
Fortunately, there is a separate
Udacity course just on this

00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:01.605
topic which you should totally
check out if you get a chance.

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:04.334
I'll leave a link to this
down in the instructor notes.

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:07.265
But there are a few important
points which I did want to cover

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:10.725
which will be both important to
improve your responsive experience but

00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:14.580
also to give your users better
access to your content.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.500
The first of those is to make sure that
you're always using a meta viewport tag,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.800
and that you're setting its
width equal to device width and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.270
its initial scale to 1.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.142
The meta viewport tag gives
the browser instructions on how

00:01:27.142 --> 00:01:30.380
to control the page's dimensions and
its scaling.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.524
By setting width equal to device-width
we're telling the viewport to match

00:01:34.524 --> 00:01:38.300
the screen's width in
device independent pixels.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.390
And by setting initial-scale equal
to 1 we're establishing a one to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.300
one relationship between CSS pixels and
device independent pixels.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.560
Doing this will instruct the browser
to fit our content to the screen so

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.280
that the user doesn't just see
a bunch of scrunched up text.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.340
Now one thing to note, when using the
viewport tag, make sure you don't force

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.360
max scale to one or
set user-scalable to no.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.389
This is a bit of an anti-pattern
because it prevents users from easily

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.680
pinching to zoom
the content of the page.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.960
Which is useful if you have a hard
time reading smaller text, so

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.960
be mindful of this one.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.790
The next technique is to make sure that
you're designing with a responsive grid.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.780
As I demonstrated with the Udacity site,
designing with a grid

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.490
means your content will reflow
when the page changes its size.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.940
So this is great for working on mobile
devices but it's also great for

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.460
those of us who need to zoom in the page
in order to read smaller text content.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.300
Oftentimes these layouts are produced
using relative units, like percents,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.730
ems, and rems,
instead of hard coded pixel values.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.330
The advantage of using relative units is
that text and content can enlarge and

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.560
force other items down the page.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.738
So the down order and the reading order
remains the same even if the layout

00:03:01.738 --> 00:03:04.080
is changing because of magnification.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.112
Now you might also consider using
relative units like or rem,

00:03:08.112 --> 00:03:13.042
specifically for text size instead of
pixel values, as some browsers support

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:17.930
resizing just the text in a page
via a user preference setting.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.240
If you're using a pixel value for

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.210
text, it may not zoom when
that setting is turned on.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.695
If, however,
you've used relative units throughout,

00:03:25.695 --> 00:03:29.810
then the text should update
to reflect that user setting.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.510
Lastly, when your design is
displaying on a mobile device,

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.300
you need to ensure that your
interactive elements like buttons or

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.450
links have touch targets
that are large enough.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.220
And have enough space around
them to make them easy to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.500
press without accidentally
overlapping onto other elements.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.320
This benefits all of your users,
but it's especially helpful for

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.750
anyone with a motor impairment.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.480
A minimum recommended touch
target size is around 48 device

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.830
independent pixels on a site with
a properly set mobile viewport.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.010
The 48 by 48 pixel area corresponds
to around 9 millimeters,

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.739
which is the same size
as someone's finger pad.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.820
So in this case I've got two
buttons here and this top one is

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.740
actually about 40 pixels,
the one below it is about 24 pixels.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.153
So to get up to this 48 device
independent pixel range what I can do is

00:04:24.153 --> 00:04:27.729
I can add some additional
padding to each of these to make

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.939
sure that their final touch target
size meets this requirement.

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.113
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:34.113 --> 00:04:38.685
Now touch targets should also
be spaced about 32 pixels apart,

00:04:38.685 --> 00:04:41.560
both horizontally and vertically.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.270
So that a user's finger pressing
on one touch target will not

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.410
inadvertently overlap onto another one.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.710
So while this icon here has
a touch target area of 48 by 48,

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.460
I'm also going to ensure that it has 32
pixels of margining around it to make

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.610
sure that it's not overlapping with this
other interactive element over here.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.320
Following this set of guidelines will
go a long way to ensure your experience

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.370
is both easy to interact with and

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.250
accessible regardless
of the device size.
