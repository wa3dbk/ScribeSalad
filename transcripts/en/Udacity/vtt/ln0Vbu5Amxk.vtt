00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.210
The time has come to check out the

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.910
mobile app for conference central. We pre-built one for

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.760
android, and if you have an android device you

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.300
can also try it out on that device. Please

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.710
see the instructor notes. This app will work

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.100
towards a conference central instance hosted by Udacity. But

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.070
remember, since you used cloud end points when you

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.650
develop Conference Central. You could also make this app

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.760
work if you recompile it towards fewer Conference

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.890
Central instance. So, here is the Udacity Conference Central

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.830
app and when I select it I need to select a user account. So, I select one here.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.920
After that, I immediately get to the main screen,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.950
which displays all the conferences that have been registered.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.900
So here you can see all the conferences created,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.980
in the conference central instance, hosted by Udacity. Should a

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.860
user add a conference using the web browser interface,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.840
for example. They would also show up here, since the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.740
Android device, and the web browser. Using the Cloud

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.519
Endpoints API to talk to the conference central server. When

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.320
I select a conference, for example, the power of chron

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.850
jobs, I can also see the details for the conference.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.350
I can also see the max attendees, and that there

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.360
are two seats left that are available. If I click

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.700
register, I get registered to the conference. And I can

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.150
see which conferences I am registered in, by this check

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.570
mark on the right. And if I go back to

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.220
the conference details, you can now see that the seats available

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.480
have been decremented to one. Now, I have

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.270
the option to unregister from a conference. And as

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.600
you can see, when I do that, this

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.780
mark disappears and, again, the available seats are two.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.190
And that's the power of cloud endpoints. When

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.750
you create your API in this way you can

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.670
access your server application from any device. Let's look

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.670
in a little more detail on how it works.
