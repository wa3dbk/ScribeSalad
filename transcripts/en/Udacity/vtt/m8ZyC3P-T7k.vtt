Obviously, either one of these could be right, and the answer does really

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:07.328
depends on what kind of game you're making, whether you have the time to make

00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:11.090
your own physics engine, and whether there's any off the shelf software you can

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.034
use to fill your needs more easily. Now when designing grids, we decided not to

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:21.938
write our own physics engine, instead to use this physics engine that was

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:25.719
already up, working, and open source.
