00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.405
If we use each side as the input to an exponential function with e as the base.

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:10.850
Then we have e to the lnx equals e to the 10. The left hand side, just

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.640
simplifies to x, because of that inverse property that we talked about. And the

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.830
right hand side, is just equal to e to the 10 still, since we haven't evaluated

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.810
this yet.
