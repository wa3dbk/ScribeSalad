00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Dave:] I'm here with Jim Fruchterman who is the director of Benetech.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Tell us about what Benetech does.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[Jim:] Benetech is Silicon Valley's non-profit technology company,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we exist to combat market failure.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Basically, when something doesn't make enough money but does a lot of social good,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we want to develop software that delivers solutions for that social problem.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
[Dave:] What kinds of things do you actually build?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
[Jim:] We write software in three different major areas.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The first one is education, especially for kids with disabilities.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Like we run the largest library for the print disabled, the blind, in the world online.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We also write software for the human rights movement, whether you're a grassroots group

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
or a truth commission or a war crimes tribunal.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Our third area is the environment.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We write project management software for environmentalists that are running campaigns

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
or managing programs on the ground to actually have the same kind of tools

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you would have in a for-profit but because you're in the environment now you've got one.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
[Dave:] And heard you're starting a new project for coding for social good.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
[Jim:] Yeah, it's in a pilot phase right now.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's called "Social Coding for Good," and you can kind of think of it as an

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
online matching site for geeks that want to do social good.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You tell us your passion, your technical skill, and your time availability,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and we'll hopefully match you up with a project like Wikimedia

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
or the Guardian Project helping human rights groups

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
or whatever other sort of project that matches up with your goals.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It's just in the pilot phase, but we're hoping that in the next year it goes to scale

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
so that geeks all over the world that want to do social good can get a chance

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to go to a place like GitHub, do some volunteering, and get some good cred

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
for having done something socially good.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
[Dave:] How much experience would students need to have to be able to start doing this?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
[Jim:] Well, I think that people in different levels of the professional area

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
of software development can actually help.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I think our initial target audience is to work on people who are in the profession,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
people who are working for high-tech companies or software developers,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
but the human rights, the environment, and the education need people at

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
all sorts of different levels.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It could be characterizing a bug or writing some documentation,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and our goal, of course, is people can increase and improve their skills

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
by doing volunteering for social good, and then hopefully that leads to a job

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
either doing social good or maybe a regular job.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
[Dave:] It sounds like you found ways to do lots of really beneficial things with technology.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Can you tell us what are the social responsibilities that someone who gets power

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
because they learned about technology should have?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
[Jim:] You know, I think that being educated in a profession like software development

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
you have a responsibility to give back to society.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Many people do that by actually getting a job and creating products that have value.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The thing I want to talk to engineers is as you go out there and you see problems

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that are important to society and they can take advantage or your skills,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
don't ignore them just because they don't make a lot of money.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I think that there are ways to make a living or volunteer to actual help these issues,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and I think that that's really an area of terrific satisfaction as a toolmaker

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
when you see the great things that people do with your tools.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Solve bit social problems and actually find a way to change the world for the better,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
not just for more money.
