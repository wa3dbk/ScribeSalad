00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.100
To help us investigate scopes,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.540
let's write a program that helps us build zany sagas full of random words.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.020
Each call that we make to a function in this program,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.820
should help us string together a new combination of nouns and

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.550
verbs, adding one more sentence in an ongoing saga about a hero.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.840
Once we start the program,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.900
all the stories will be about this same hero that was randomly selected for us.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.810
Each saga about this hero will feature a different randomly selected

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.850
foil character.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.740
The program will call functions such that we string together a new

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.130
combination of nouns and verbs, adding one more sentence to this ongoing saga.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.980
And that's it, it's a simple little program,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.200
let's see how we could implement it using the feature of Scopes in JavaScript.
