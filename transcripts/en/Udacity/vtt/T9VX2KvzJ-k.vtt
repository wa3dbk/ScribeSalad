00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.957
So, we found that the standard error is 0.024, but we still need our interval

00:00:05.957 --> 00:00:12.348
estimate. Let's say that we want a 95% confidence interval, abbreviated CI, for

00:00:12.348 --> 00:00:16.570
short. I'm going to put our standard error of the mean over here. And I really

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.420
should make this capital N, since it's the population, and n is the sample size

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.139
20. Based on the results from our sample mean, which was 0.13, then the true

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:34.327
population mean, if everyone has access to this musical lesson will be somewhere

00:00:34.327 --> 00:00:40.557
around 0.13. And within 95% confidence interval, we're assuming that this sample

00:00:40.557 --> 00:00:46.227
mean is one of the 95% of sample means that will be around the true population

00:00:46.227 --> 00:00:52.973
mean. We're going to call the true population Mu sub I. I for intervention. So,

00:00:52.973 --> 00:00:59.173
this means that if this sample mean is within this 95% of Mu sub I, then Mu sub

00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:05.203
I, then Mu sub I is can be here or here. See how that sample mean is on the

00:01:05.203 --> 00:01:11.644
lower bound of that 95%. Whereas here, the sample mean is on the upper bound of

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:16.668
that 95%. So if Mu sub I can either be here or here, in this interval

00:01:16.668 --> 00:01:22.980
surrounding 0.13, then this is our confidence interval. What are these values?

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.334
So, this value here should be what? And this value here should be what?
