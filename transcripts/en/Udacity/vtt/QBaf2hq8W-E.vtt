00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.000
We've come to the last coding exercise in this course.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.390
Now that you've got your conference central application up and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.750
running, I'm going to show you a couple of things you'll

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.930
need to do if you want to write a mobile

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.830
application to use your conference API. You're going to need to

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.510
give your mobile app a client ID. Regardless of whether

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.040
you're building an Android app or an IOS app, you

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.830
need a client ID. And just like with the web application,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.110
you create the client ID in the developer console. We're also going to

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.600
generate the client libraries for your conference API so that you can include

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.360
those libraries in your mobile application. But what your mobile application

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.270
chooses to do with the Conference API, well, that's up to you. Come on then!
