Well, it turns out it's just a squared minues b squared. We know that these

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:09.295
middle terms, or linear terms, always sum to zero. So we're really only left

00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:14.084
with these, our squares. So we'll have our first term squared minus our second

00:00:14.084 --> 00:00:16.639
term squared. That's true in every case.
