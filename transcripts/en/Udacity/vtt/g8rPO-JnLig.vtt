Alright.

00:00:00.654 --> 00:00:06.001
So, we've written this XMLHttp request code a few times now. Let's go ahead and

00:00:06.013 --> 00:00:11.138
extract it out. What I'd like you to do is fill out the function xhrGet that

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.472
does, well, exactly what we've done the past couple of times with xhrs. Takes in

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:19.880
the request URI, like weapon.json, or bg_menu.ogg,

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:24.722
it takes in a callback function to set the onload function too and it takes in

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:29.190
a type, which could be either nothing, if we're expecting text data or

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:34.372
arraybuffer, if we are expecting arraybuffer data. Now, one quick note

00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:39.504
about the callbacks, we're going to create the callbacks such that we assume that it takes

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:44.637
the request object as a parameter. So, for example, you can see our parseJSON

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.903
function here takes the xhr, and then parses xhr.responseText. Now, we have both

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:55.242
the parseJSON and playSound functions here, that if passed in as callbacks, will

00:00:55.254 --> 00:01:00.191
appropriately play sound or parseJSON as we've done before. Now, down at the

00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:05.780
bottom of this file, we make 2 calls to xhrGet with weapon.json and bg_menu.ogg.

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:10.622
Just for you to test again to make sure that your xhrGet function is behaving

00:01:10.622 --> 00:01:11.130
properly.
