00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.110
Now, Bob, Carol, and Alice who are going to come in later are finally having their meeting.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.610
Well, I should say something about Carol's algorithm,

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.630
but Carol already has a bit more experience with algorithms than Bob or Alice.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.249
She has already figured out that a simple algorithm that you just try

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:23.690
all the possibilities of selecting certain investment opportunities

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.360
into her portfolio is just not going to cut it.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.900
Carol is really looking forward to meeting Bob and figuring out some new ideas.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.310
At the beginning of the meeting, Alice is not there yet.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.870
Bob and Carol started explaining their problems to each other.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.869
Bob is explaining to Carol how among a set of genes some of which are connected.

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:46.640
He is looking for groups where every gene is connected to every other gene

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.899
and Carol, of course, explains her problem

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.320
where she is looking for potential investments that are not connected to each other.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.710
such as this one here.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.840
Now, in order to not have to talk about genes and investments anymore,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.250
we should use some common terminology for both of those problems

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.079
and if you already have an algorithm's course,

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:14.780
you might have come across a structure known as graphs.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.870
and graphs are basically just objects that are connected to each other.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.960
The network up here at would be called a graph

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.950
and the network down here would also be called a graph.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.100
This here, the object would be called a vertex

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.940
and of course, this, this, and all of these objects are vertices

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.920
so this would also be a vertex, here, either the purple or the green ones

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.030
and then the connections are called edges.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.870
All of the blue connections or some of those that I've colored green here

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.660
every single one of them is an edge.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.300
An edge always connects to vertices and the whole structure is called a graph.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.809
And if you used that terminology, you can state the problems

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:59.930
that Bob and Carol are working on using a similar language.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:08.699
Bob's problem is basically taking as input a graph with n vertices

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:26.698
and the output that he is looking for is the largest set of vertices all connected to each other.

00:02:26.698 --> 00:02:33.010
What Carol is looking for, again the input is a graph with n vertices

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.139
and the output is the largest set of vertices not all connected to each other

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.920
that non-connected to each other.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.970
As you can see, once we use the common terminology, the problem that Bob is working on

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.880
is actually very, very similar to the one that Carol is working on.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.750
The only difference is Bob is looking for a set of vertices where all are connected to each other

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.029
and Carol is working on a problem where none of the vertices are connected to each other

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:01.330
but everything else is the same.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.850
You are given a graph with n vertices, you are looking for the largest possible set,

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.680
and all it's about is the connection that these vertices have to each other.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.620
In the future, to be better able to talk about these problems,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.289
we'll also give them names as we do with most problems

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:21.500
Also, so that we don't always have to say this is Bob's problem and this is Carol's problem.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.480
What we will call Bob's problem is a problem named Clique

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.770
because all of those vertices are very closely connected to each other

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.880
just like in a clique of friends for example

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.650
And we'll call Carol's problem independent set.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.970
Carol is basically looking for the opposite of a closely collected clique.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.240
Carol is looking for vertices that are not connected to each other.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.830
If those were friends, they wouldn't know of each other.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.190
Now, after Bob and Carol have explained their problems to each other

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.210
and given them the name, they noticed since the only difference

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.890
between clique and independent set is that in one we're looking for all vertices

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.290
to be connected and on the other one we are looking for none of the vertices to be connected

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.300
That problems are actually very, very closely related,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.559
and I will show you the idea that they come up with to figure out how similar these problems are.

00:04:09.559 --> 99:59:59.000
also from an algorithmic perspective.
