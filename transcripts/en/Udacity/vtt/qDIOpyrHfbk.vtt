00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.558
For this skills check, I want you to match each inequality with a number line

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.082
and its interval notation. Think about whether brackets or parentheses are

00:00:09.094 --> 00:00:13.838
important and think about if you're less than or greater than. For example, for

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.437
this inequality, if you think its number line was 2 and its interval notation

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.073
was d, you put 2d in the box.
