00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.790
Here the solutions for x are 4 plus or minus 2i times root 5. Fantastic work if

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.528
you found those solutions. This one wasn't so simple. First we subtract 36 from

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:15.539
both sides, to get this equation. Next, we complete the square by adding b over

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:21.013
2 squared to both sides. The b value is negative 8. So, that makes b over 2,

00:00:21.013 --> 00:00:26.074
negative 4. We square this number to get 16. Adding 16 to both sides of the

00:00:26.074 --> 00:00:30.554
equation, we get x minus 4 squared, this is our perfect square and negative 20

00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:36.180
on the right. We take the square root of both sides of the equation, to get x

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.474
minus 4 equals plus or minus the square root of negative 20. Then, we add 4 to

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:45.655
both sides of the equation to get our solutions for x. We do need to do one

00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:49.504
more step. We need to simplify. The square root of negative 20 is going to be

00:00:49.504 --> 00:00:54.245
an imaginary number, since the radicand is negative. We can split up the square

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:58.220
root of negative 20 into these three square roots. The square root of negative

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.587
1 is i, the square root of 4 is 2. And we can't take the square root of 5, so

00:01:02.587 --> 00:01:06.780
we leave it underneath the radical. These are our simplified solutions
