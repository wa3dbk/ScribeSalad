00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So case 1, the code that didn't cover is infeasible code.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The second case is the code that we believe to be feasible but which isn't worth covering.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
A code might not be worth covering because it's very hard to trigger and it's very simple.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So let me give a quick example. The res variable is the result of the command to format a disc.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And if that operation fails, we'll just going to abort the program.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And so what might be the case is that we lack an appropriate fault injection tool

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that will let us easily simulate the failure of a format disc call.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And in furthermore, the response of the code in this case is to

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
simply abort the execution of the program.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If those two things are the case, then we might be perfectly happy not to test this code branch,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and the reason is the abort code, which is going to terminate the entire application,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
is presumably something that was tested elsewhere, so we don't have any real suspicion

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that it might fail and there's no reason to think that calling it from a location like this

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
would act any differently or will probably be okay.
