00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For this procedure you're asked to reverse a list, and any elements that are lists

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
within that list you're also asked to reverse.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm going to label the elements A, B, C, and each of these elements needs to be in reverse order.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
C, B, A.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now C is itself a list, which means that C is going to have to be reversed as well.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
B is a list, and A is just a single element.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Well, when it's a single element, that's it. We're done. A is fine.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
B we're going to have to reverse.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Each element in B is now just an element. It's not a list. That's fine.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Finally, in C it looks like we've got a lot of work to do here,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because we've got 4 and this list of lists.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Those need to be reversed.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Four is okay, but 5, 6, 7--that's another list of lists.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
That one needs to be reversed, and so on.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We're going to have to keep going until we get down to looking at the elements themselves which are not lists.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That gives us the structure for our procedure,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
because we're doing the same thing over and over again to smaller parts of the lists,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that really lends itself well to using recursion, and that's what we're going to do.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
No we're going to define the procedure deep_reverse.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The first thing we're going to check is whether we have a list as our input.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We're going use this function is_list,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and if p is a list, then what we are going to do is create a new list, an empty list.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We want to go through the elements in the original list in reverse order.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
In order to do that, we're going to count backwards.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The last position is the length of the list -1.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Then we want to go length of list -2, -3, and so on, all the way down to 0.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We can do that using range.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
For i in range the length of the list -1.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Because range stops one before the second input number,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
we have to go to -1 because we want to end at 0.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We also want to tell it to count backwards.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We want to count in -1 steps.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What do we want to do? Well, we just want to append each element of the list in reverse order.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
But we don't want to just put the element in,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
because remember we've actually go to reverse each element as well.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We're going to call the procedure again on each of the elements of the list.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Then when the loop has finished, we're just going to return the result.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Now, we haven't got a stopping condition yet.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
When did we stop when we were doing the example?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
We stopped when we got to an element that was not a list.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So our else condition we just return whatever that element is.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
That's our base case for the recursion.
