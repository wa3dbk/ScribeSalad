00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.719
There's a slightly different notation that's often used for composite

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:08.222
functions. Instead of writing f of g of x. We can write this, which we read as

00:00:08.222 --> 00:00:14.140
f composed with g of x. These two notations mean exactly the same thing. Since

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.130
we already found f of g of x, or in other words F composed with G. Can you tell

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.804
me what G composed with F is? In other words, I'm asking you what g of f of x

00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:26.119
is for these two functions?
