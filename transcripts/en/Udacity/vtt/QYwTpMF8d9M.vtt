00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.690
A source router can adjust traffic over multiple paths

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.800
by having multiple forwarding table entries for the same destination,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.820
and splitting traffic flows across the multiple next hops, depending

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.340
on, for example, the hash of the IP packet header.
