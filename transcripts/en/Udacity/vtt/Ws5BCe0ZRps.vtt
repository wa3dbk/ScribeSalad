Okay, for this quiz, what I want you to do is simplify these fractions. You're

00:00:04.973 --> 00:00:09.631
going to simplify these fractions and then pair it with the image that it

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:15.315
matches. For example, when I reduce 6/8 I got 3/4. I would look at my images and

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:20.113
then I see, oh, f, I have 1, 2, 3, out of 4. So f would be the answer for 6/8.

00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:22.786
You could put your answer in these boxes.
