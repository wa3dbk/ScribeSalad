00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.180
So these hooks, this four step process,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.010
starts with a trigger to an action,
then a reward, and then an investment.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.540
So every hook starts with a trigger.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.610
A trigger prompts the habit, and
we have these two types of triggers,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.650
an external trigger or
an internal trigger.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.510
External triggers are things in
our environment that tell us

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.200
what to do next.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.310
They give us some piece of information,
click here, buy now,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.890
a friend telling you about this
great new app through word of mouth.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.080
All example of external triggers.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.200
These external triggers
prompt us to action.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.689
That's the habit itself.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.530
Opening an app, scroll through
Pinterest, search on Google,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.530
push the play button on YouTube.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.960
These are these actions that we do
with little to no conscious thought,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.180
that are these very simple behaviors,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.480
these very small behaviors
that we do seeking a reward.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.770
Which brings me to the third step
of the hook, the reward phase

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.060
is where the user's itch is scratched
where they get what they came for,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.430
and yet there is a bit of mystery
around what they might find

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.662
next time they engage with the product.

00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:03.960
So it's not just a reward, it turns
out that habit forming technologies

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.370
integrate what's called
a variable reward.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.390
So this comes from the classic
work of BF Skinner,

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.340
the father of operant conditioning.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.200
Skinner found that when he gave rewards
to his pigeons in these little boxes,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.900
on a variable basis, so sometimes
the pigeons would peck at the disk,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.080
they wouldn't receive a reward, the next
time they would receive a reward.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.620
What Skinner observed was
that the rate of response,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.300
the number of times these pigeons pecked
at the disk increased when the reward

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.560
was given on an intermittent
new schedule of reinforcement.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.570
And so in all sorts of products
that we find most habit forming,

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.230
most engaging, we find this bit of
mystery, this bit of variability.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.340
So searching and scrolling and
scrolling on a news feed, or

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.660
what makes sports fun to watch
is the uncertainty of will our

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.190
team win the game, or what makes for
a great TV show or movie?

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.010
Right, the uncertainty about how
the happy ending is going to unwind.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.990
All of these are examples
of variable rewards.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.540
And finally, the investment phase,
the last step of the hook.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.150
The investment phase is where the user
is prompted to put something into

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.060
the product to invest in the product
in anticipation of a future benefit.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.740
So the purpose of investments is to
increase the likelihood of the next

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.890
pass, that's what the investment phase
is for, and it does this in two ways.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.671
The investments load the next trigger.

00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:25.856
So loading the next trigger, an example
of that would be, when I send someone

00:02:25.856 --> 00:02:28.699
a message on WhatsApp, I don't
get any immediate rewards, right?

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.419
There's no leader boards,
there's no badges, there's no points,

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.090
nothing really happens.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.640
What I'm doing is I'm loading the next
trigger because I'm likely to get

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.180
a reply, and that reply comes coupled
with an external trigger, hey here's

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.410
a message from your friend, which
prompts me to use the hook once again.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.430
The second way that investments increase
the likelihood of the next pass

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.100
is by storing value,
and this is a big deal.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.440
Storing value is when the product
gets better and better with use.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.170
It appreciates in value,

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.895
and it does this by storing data,
followers, reputation, content.

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:03.490
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Right,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.340
anything that I'm putting into the app
that gets better and better over time.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.179
And so it's through successive
cycles through these hooks,

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:12.544
trigger, action, reward,

00:03:12.544 --> 00:03:16.268
investment, that now an association is
built with that second type of trigger.

00:03:16.268 --> 00:03:19.074
Remember, I told you there was two types
of triggers, external triggers and

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.250
internal triggers.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.830
The internal trigger are these
things in our life that prompt us

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.640
to action like a place, a situation,
a routine, a certain person, and

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.540
most frequently emotions that prompt us
to do this next action, this next habit,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.400
with little or no conscious thought,
but without any explicit information.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.490
So over time, through successive
cycles through these hooks,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.300
now we use the product,
not with a message that tells us, hey,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.360
click here, but with a need, exactly.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.940
We internally trigger ourselves,
we have these associations.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.420
So I'm lonely, I check Facebook.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.170
I'm uncertain, I Google.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.210
I'm bored and I'm on YouTube, or
Reddit, or checking stock prices, or

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.160
sports scores, right?

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.640
We do these things instantaneously
because of these successive cycles

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.380
through these hooks.
