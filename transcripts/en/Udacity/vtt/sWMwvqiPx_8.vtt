Our first piece of information up here tells us that 92 wiper sets were made in

00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:09.504
the time frame we're considering. So, number of wiper sets made equals 92. The

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:14.095
next piece of information says, that the cost to make all of those wiper sets

00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:18.438
was $598. So, we can write 598 in the cost to make 92 wiper sets. This may seem

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.803
sort of silly right now, but we've set ourselves up really well to move forward

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:27.168
and come up with an equation that only has numbers and variables. No more words,

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:31.092
thankfully. Word equations are really, really useful for helping us

00:00:31.104 --> 00:00:35.790
conceptualize problems, but they take a really long time to write out. So, we

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:38.055
can simplify what we're doing, that's awesome.
