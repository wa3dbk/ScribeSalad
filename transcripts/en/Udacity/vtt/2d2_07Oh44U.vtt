00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is fairly straight forward.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We just take the square roots of each of these numbers.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The square root of 2 is approximately 1.414.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The square root of 4 is simply 2.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The square root of 20 is approximately 4.472.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What's interesting about this is that these tend to grow more slowly

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
than does the mean or the variance.

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
They don't grow linearly with time.
