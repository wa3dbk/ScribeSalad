00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.760
Congratulations and good job! You've made it to the end of Unit 1.

00:00:03.772 --> 00:00:06.750
You've learned a lot about parallel computing on the GPU already,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.481
both the fundamentals of the GPU programming model, and how to write your first GPU program.

00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:16.853
Now we're going to talk to NVIDIA Chief Scientist and Senior Vice President of Research, Bill Dally.

00:00:16.853 --> 00:00:19.208
Bill is one of the pioneers of parallel computing,

00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:21.725
so I hope you enjoy his perspective as much as I do.

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:24.543
After the interview, we can dive into problem set 1,

00:00:24.543 --> 00:00:30.133
where you'll write a program that will transform a color image into a gray scale image,

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.702
and we'll provide a lot of the surrounding code for this assignment,

00:00:32.702 --> 00:00:35.019
but you're going to write the most important part;

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:41.758
the part that actually does the parallel processing on the GPU.
