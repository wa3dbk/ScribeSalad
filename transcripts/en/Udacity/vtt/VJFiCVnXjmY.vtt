00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.561
The equation that we ended up with at the
end of the last quiz for Grant's total

00:00:03.573 --> 00:00:07.317
future earnings, taking into account the
two updates to the number of orders he has

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:10.681
received, is definitely helpful. But I
think that we can still make it look

00:00:10.693 --> 00:00:14.292
better. In fact, I know we can because I
see that there are some like terms here

00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:17.851
that have not yet been combined. Using
your understanding of the distributive

00:00:17.863 --> 00:00:21.703
property and just simplifying expressions
in general, please simply this expression

00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:25.215
as much as you can. You'll notice that I
actually, in the last quiz, already did

00:00:25.227 --> 00:00:27.918
part of it for you. So, see if you can
remember how to do this.
