00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.640
So how many people would like to find
their blind spot, raise your hand.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.682
You can't, it's blind, no.

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:05.700
We're going to do that.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.119
So it's actually really, really easy.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.370
Couple of ways we can do this.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.070
So, on my screen right now, I have
a picture of a, a plus and a, and a dot.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.640
Your blind spot is always on
the outside of your visual field.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.860
So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to
look for the blind spot in my left eye.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.340
So it's going to be outside.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.600
So what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to, whoa!

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.680
It happened right now.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.930
So right now I'm looking at
that dot on the right, and

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.640
to the left of it is a cross.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.490
And if I move here, there's the cross.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.570
There's the cross, but
right here, the cross is gone.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.380
I think that's at 12 deg,
I can't remember,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.530
I think it's 12 degrees out, right?

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.150
It's just not there.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.875
It's just plain black.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.912
Okay if I want to do
it with my right eye,

00:00:47.912 --> 00:00:51.750
well what I'll do is I'll look at
the cross, and I'll move until I oh!

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.750
There it goes.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.660
The circle is gone.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.710
If you are doing this,
if you rotate your head like that,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.720
the cross comes back because the blind
spot is located off to one side and as

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.690
I rotate, the blind spot is now up here
and the, and the, the cross pops back.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.880
In class, normally what I do is I
make a bunch of pieces of paper and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.480
I hand this out right here.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.130
Okay, and I ask people to
take their left eye, so, so,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.880
for those of you not paying attention,
so we have a dot, and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.300
over here we have a bar with a cross
hash pattern in the middle of it.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.420
And what I do is,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.410
I tell people to move that dot til
something seems to happen to that bar.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.730
All right, so back here I see the bar
with the cross hash, I move in, and

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.630
then something happens, the cross
hash disappears into just a line.
