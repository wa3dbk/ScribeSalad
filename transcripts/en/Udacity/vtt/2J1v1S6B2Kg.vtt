00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In physics, the conservation of energy is highly related to the conservation of area in phase space.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to introduce that notion in a second.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Solvers did also conserve that area, are pretty good at conserving the energy,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
not exactly but almost exactly.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For simplicity, I'm looking at a one dimensional system.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The position is one dimension just a single number,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the velocity has one dimension, just a single number.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Phase space is the coordinate x and v and this is actually use the momentum

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which is mass time velocity.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I don't want you to be confused, so I stick to velocity.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
For every point in this phase space, you can look it's temporal evolution

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000
given the value of x and given the value of v, we can solve the system of differential equations

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and something is going to happen about that point and another point and to another point.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You start from that initial condition to given x and the given v

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and look at what happens to this x and that v and look at what happens to position and velocity.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The trick now is to look at infinitely many initial conditions at the same time.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
A complete some area in phase space. This is what we're talking about.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Let's look at all of these initial conditions. What's going to happen with them?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Where is the evolution going? Where is the differential equation taking us?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Can this way, we see an evolution of area in phase space?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This set of initial conditions will have to say one second end up here

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and after another second may be end up here and so and so on.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
An area in phase space remains constant, that's called Liouville's theorem.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Why does the area in phase space stay constant as it evolves? Let's look at the first equation.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The position changes with the rate of the velocity,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
so if you rate for a small time and look at wherever ending, x will increase a little here,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
increase more here, more here, and so on depending on v

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and this motion does not depend on x, it just depends on v.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So, our initial area will be deformed to this which, is the same area.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Simply use this part, glue it to that part and you'll see

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that the blue parallelogram has the same area as the top of the rectangle.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So the first equation alone would not change the area.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
If you look at the second equation on its own, the rate of change of the velocity

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
depends on x and on x only, so if this velocity is changed by that much,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
also this velocity will change by that much and that velocity will change by that much.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The rate of change does not depend on v, it just depends on x,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
so we could have a different rate of change here but it has to be the same for all velocities

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and maybe there's a little bit of change here and again it has to be the same for all velocities.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So our purple rectangle is transformed into something that may look like this

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and that still has the same area as the original purple rectangle had.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
To see that, simply take this slice and push it down and take this slice

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and push it down and so on and so on.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So each equation alone would not change the area.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
If it continuously apply these rates of change, together we also have no problem.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
If x evolve for an infinitesimal short amount of time,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and then we let v evolve for an infinitesimal short amount of time

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and then it's the turn of x again and so on and so on--that's going to work.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
If we apply the first equation for an infinitesimal amount of time,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and then we apply the second equation for an infinitesimal amount of time,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
the area stays the same, and we apply the first equation again and so on and so on.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
If you step through this and infinitesimally short time steps, that's going to work.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Problem is can be applied both equations at the same time

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and do not use infinitesimally short time steps then it's going to break

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and that's precisely what the forward Euler's method does.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
You can see one solution to that problem, you apply the first one for a finite time step

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
then the second one for a finite time step then the first one and second one and so on

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
one after the other, that's going to work, that's going to conserve a phase space area.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
This leads to the conservation of that area and solvers

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
which have the same property are called symplectic.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Sometimes people also use the term geometric integrators.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We are going to build the simple most one of these and have a look at the long term behavior

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and there's something to note all of this works because the force

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
neither depends on time nor on velocity.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
If the force was influenced by time or velocity that would most probably break this nice behavior.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Homework 1 is going to show the evolution of phase space

00:05:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
in action producing some nice diagrams.
