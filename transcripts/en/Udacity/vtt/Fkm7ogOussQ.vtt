00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:00.910
We reload the map.

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.710
It looks like the circles are placed in reasonably right locations.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.079
We can see the South Korea and Japan World Cup, the South Africa World Cup.

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:14.095
A number of World Cups in various countries in South America,

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:17.727
a number of World Cups in various European countries and

00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:20.895
then two World Cups in Mexico and one in the U.S.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:26.170
and good news that no circles were plotted in the middle of the ocean.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.860
Means that the center pixels that we calculated, are approximately correct and

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.970
what's left to do, is to properly scale the circles, so

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.570
that they correctly represent the attendance.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.460
So, rather than using a constant value, set the attribute r,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.360
while passing an accessor function, which in this case will set to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.210
the aggregate attendance, for a given year of the world cup.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.390
Going back to our map and reloading the page, however, we

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.480
can see that something has gone very, very wrong and the whole screen is black.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.510
Can you figure out what went wrong with the visualization,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.700
when we tried to set the radius of our circles?
