00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:09.532
So what happens here is that we write down four equal factors--one plus X over four times one plus X over four,

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:17.799
times one plus X over four, times one plus X over four. And then we look what this is going to turn into.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:26.599
For the first box we need everything that has no X whatsoever. This is just one times one times one times one.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:36.899
Anything else would have an X in it. So this becomes one. For the next box, we need everything that has precisely one X in it.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:45.832
For instance, X over four times one times one times one. One times X over four times one times one.

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:56.166
One times one times X over four times one, and there's a fourth one: One times one times one times X over four.

00:00:56.167 --> 00:01:04.866
We get four of these. Four times X over four, which is one times X. Four X squared.

00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:13.899
We have X from the first two parentheses, but one from parentheses number three and parentheses number four.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.632
X from the first, one from the second, X from the third, one from the fourth.

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:28.066
Or X from the first, one from the second, one from the third, and X from the fourth.

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:39.199
Or one from the first, X from the second, X from the third, one from the fourth, one from the first, X from the second,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:51.199
one from the third, and X from the fourth. And the final one, one from the first, one from the second, X from the third, X from the fourth.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:00.499
Six options to form something that contains X squared. Six times X over four times X over four.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.599
We can cancel a factor of two, which leaves us with three over eight.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.766
To get X to the third power, we need to pick X from three parentheses, and one from the other.

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:20.299
We can pick X from the first three parentheses, and the one from the last, or X from parentheses number one, number two,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:29.332
the one from the third, X from the last, X from the first parentheses, one from the second, X from the third,

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:36.899
X from the fourth, and one from the first, X from the second, X from the third, X from the fourth.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:47.699
So, four ways of doing this, four times X over four times X over four, times X over four, which leaves us with X to the third power

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.099
over 16. One over 16. And the final one: We need four factors of X.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.699
You have to pick this and this and this and this. That's it. Only one option for doing that.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:09.099
Which leaves us with X over four times X over four times X over four times X over four.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:16.199
X to the fourth power divided by 256. One over 256.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.799
So this is a crude approximation to the exponential function, and we find a way of expressing this with powers of X.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.332
The beginning of a power series. Let me restate the general equation for the exponential function again.

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:38.999
E to the power of X is the limit as N goes to infinity of one plus X over N to the power of N.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.199
We have now looked at the special case of N equals four. Hopefully, you can imagine that this also works out

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:56.299
for 40 or 400, 4,000, four billion, four whichever number. And the result is it's one plus X--

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:04.566
We have that already. One plus one X, plus X squared over two. You see we're close.

00:04:04.567 --> 00:04:10.332
Four over eight would be one half. We've got three over eight, with that four here.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:20.332
Plus X to the third power over six, plus X to the fourth power over 24, plus, and so on, up to infinity.

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:26.966
To prove this, you need a better method than we have used here; you need binomial coefficients.

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:31.532
But hopefully, you get the idea where this power series comes from.

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:41.966
And actually, it turns out that the six is the factorial of three; this 24 is the factorial of four, and so on.

00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:48.032
So the general term would be X to the power of N divided by N factorial.

00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:55.632
This also gives us a way of computing E itself. E equals E to the power of one.

00:04:55.633 --> 00:05:07.799
So we simply set X to one, which means E equals one plus one plus one over two, plus one over six, plus one over 24,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.199
plus, and so on, up to infinity. And now you can see how efficient this power series is.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:26.966
One plus one, so we have two already, plus one half, is 2.5, plus one over six equals 2.6.

00:05:26.967 --> 00:05:35.099
You see we're getting pretty quickly pretty close to 2.71 something. So if you actually want to computer Euler's number,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.033
or the exponential function, you're using this power series.
