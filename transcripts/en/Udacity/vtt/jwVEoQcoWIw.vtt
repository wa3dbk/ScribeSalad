00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The next case is we pick this v at random, and it just so happens that it partitions

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to something bigger than K--so this is case III here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What happens at this point? Well, all the values get separated out.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
all the ones smaller than v end up over here,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and all the ones bigger than v end up over here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And we haven't really solved the problem yet but we have made it a lot smaller.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Consider at this point the list of the Lâ€™ from here to here.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is a list of elements that Top K of this list is going to be exactly the Top K of the original list

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because the values that we're throwing out here can't possibly be in the Top K.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What we can do at this point is look again for the Top K,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but now just do it on the sublist of L[0:rank(v)].

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
By picking v, we've actually just made this problem smaller. So great.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now we've handled two of the three cases. One case, it's completely solved.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And another case, we have a smaller version of the same problem.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
What about the third case? So the third case is when the rank(v) is smaller than K.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We do a partition and the v that we happened to pick is off to the left here.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So what that means is we've now separated the list into elements that are smaller than this v value

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
over here and elements that are bigger than this v value over here.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And what do we know about this initial list? Well, we know that this actually is in the Top K.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But we don't know about what's going on with the rest of the world over here.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But we learned enough to have made some progress.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Again we're going to recurse. Now what do we need to do?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Well, this is the list that we are still unsure about.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And there could be some off by ones in here but just to give you the basic idea

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
from the rank of v, from this position here to the end of the list is what we care about.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But we don't want to find the Top K of this. We want to find the Top K - rank(v). Why?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Because we already know these elements here are already in the Top K.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We only really need to care about what's left. The K - rank(v) that we haven't found yet.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Those are the three cases that we care about, and we ought to be able to code this up

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and actually find the Top K in this list.
