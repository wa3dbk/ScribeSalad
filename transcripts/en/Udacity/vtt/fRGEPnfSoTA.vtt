00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.781
The first thing that's important to remember is that the first coordinate we

00:00:03.793 --> 00:00:07.745
have in any ordered pair is the horizontal position of the point, and the second

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:11.630
coordinate is the vertical position. So, let's start with the first point as an

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:15.399
example. We have an x coordinate of 1. So we move from the origin over to the

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:19.671
right in a positive direction 1, and a y-coordinate of 2, so we move up two,

00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:24.184
that's point b. For the second one, we have negative 2 as our x value so

00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:29.208
starting at the origin, we count to the left in the negative direction 1, 2. And

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.919
then, the y value is 1 so we count up one. So, that's point d. And we can do the

00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:38.227
same process for every other point on here. So here, so here are the final

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.236
answers, luckily none of my letters are the same in any of the boxes cause that

00:00:42.248 --> 00:00:46.139
would indicate that we had made a mistake. Every pair has a unique position on

00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:49.880
the coordinate plane. And in the same way, every position on the coordinate

00:00:49.892 --> 00:00:51.486
plane has a unique ordered pair
