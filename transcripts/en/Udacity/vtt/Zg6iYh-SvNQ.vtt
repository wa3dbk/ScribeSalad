00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.960
As we just said, EHR certification
specifies requirements for

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.790
commercial EHR systems.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.710
This is a very important development,
because for

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.430
decades the grand challenge for
health IT here in the U.S.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.550
has been interoperability, the ability
of hundreds of commercial EMR

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.710
products and tools to exchange and
meaningfully share data.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.230
Even with universal adoption,
without some degree of interoperability,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.510
we still wouldn't be able to coordinate
care among the many providers who care

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.120
for the same patients and
who may well have different EMR systems.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.700
So the EHR certification
process supports,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.960
among other things, a basic
interoperability standard or capability.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.320
Systems must be able to record key
specified demographic and clinical data.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.000
They must be able to provide tools
to measure and improve care quality.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.890
And, of course,
they must protect the confidentiality,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.320
integrity of the health
care data that they record.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.510
We'll now look at each
of these in some detail.
