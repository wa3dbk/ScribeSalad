00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.370
D3 isn't necessarily magic, but it hides a lot of complexity for you.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.090
So it might seem mysterious.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.790
But if you dig deep enough,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.710
you can always find out where the source of what it's doing is.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.960
In this case, the data attribute in the DOM.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.410
And something I don't advise, but you can do, is you actually mutate the data of

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.970
this circle by changing individual fields on the .__data__attribute.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.050
And again, this is a somewhat bad practice unless you

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.730
know exactly what you're doing since it could lead to issues of data corruption,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.480
here we've simply changed the attendance of the first gain to 1 million.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.860
But enough fooling around.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.670
Let's get back to the code and actually draw some circles.
