00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.742
Graphs A and D probably look pretty familiar to you and they go respectively

00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:07.928
with functions G and F. I know it probably seems a little bit strange because

00:00:07.928 --> 00:00:10.853
we haven't seen equations like these before, even though you recognize their

00:00:10.853 --> 00:00:14.752
graphs. We'll talk more about this later, but start to think, right now, about

00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:18.950
what these equations reduce to. And why they produce the graphs that they do.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.163
Graphs B and C however are definitely new for us. Graph B represents the

00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:28.480
function one over X and graph C represents the function one over X squared.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.532
You'll see a lot more graphs that look like these two over the next few

00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:34.139
lessons. And pretty soon you'll understand exactly what's happening in each of

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.799
them.
