00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.245
Now let's see how to implement
an interstitial ad in Android Studio.

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:06.973
And for this I'll be using
the Amazon Mobile Ads API,

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:09.649
which I've downloaded from
their developer site.

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:11.554
If you still need to download that API,

00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:14.964
please refer back to our reading
node for instructions, otherwise,

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:18.222
follow along with my code and
we'll test our end result together.

00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:23.405
So I've opened Android Studio and titled
a new project named My Interstitial Ad.

00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:25.074
You can name yours whatever you want,
but

00:00:25.074 --> 00:00:27.992
keep in mind that it's always good to
have a clear and descriptive name.

00:00:27.992 --> 00:00:30.860
Then let's create a new
blank activity and

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.655
I'll name it Interstitial Ad Activity.

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:37.487
Okay, great, and we can see we have
a few bare bones things in here already.

00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:43.033
We have our xml layout file here,
and our interstitial ad activity.

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:46.557
The most important method to us here
is going to be our on create method,

00:00:46.557 --> 00:00:49.811
which sets our view up so
that we can display our interstitial ad.

00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:53.226
So I've copied this Java file,
and pasted it into our project,

00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:54.625
in the Java lives folder.

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:57.430
Then we need to click it and
say add as library.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.442
Now, we should be able to open it,
and we can see all the classes and

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:06.101
interfaces that we have access to,
like add layout and listener, and also,

00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:07.260
interstitial ad.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.549
We also need to add a couple lines of
code to our android manifest XML file.

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.953
So let's take a look at that.

00:01:12.953 --> 00:01:14.739
Inside our applications tag,

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:18.591
I've added lines that reference
Amazon's ad activity package.

00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:22.027
And outside of the application tag,
you can see that I've also declared

00:01:22.027 --> 00:01:25.759
the permissions we need to use, which
let us use the Internet to retrieve ads.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.890
I've also added these extra runs that
allow us to get the user's locational

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.899
data, these can be useful if you want
to target ads to specific location.

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.052
So make sure you've changed your android
manifest and included your library.

00:01:38.052 --> 00:01:41.395
And now, let's dive into our Java
code to make an interstitial ad.
