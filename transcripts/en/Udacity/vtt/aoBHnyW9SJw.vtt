00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.902
We saw in the last quiz that x minus a is a factor of a function, f of x, if

00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:11.246
and only if f of a equals 0. So let's take another function as an example to

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:15.928
see if this rule that we just figured out really makes sense. If we have f of x

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:21.316
equals x squared plus 3 x minus 10. Then what do we get for f of two. Please

00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:25.156
write that in this box. Now based on your answer here, you may or may not have

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:29.190
information that tells you about a factor of f of x. If you think you can

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.108
figure one of theme out, please write it right here. Remember to find f of two,

00:00:33.108 --> 00:00:36.484
just replace every x here with a two.
