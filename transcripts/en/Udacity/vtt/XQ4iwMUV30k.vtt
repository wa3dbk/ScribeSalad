00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I told you to use a mathematical formula, so I cheated a little bit.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I wrote a little piece of code to actually generate a complete graph

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and then return the number of edges in that graph.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
To make a complete graph, I just looped through all the pairs of nodes,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and if one node was smaller than the other, then I made a link between them.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That was mainly to just make sure I didn't make a link from nodes to themselves.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There is no reason not to make a link the other way.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It would have not counted against the total, but this seemed nicer and cleaner.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's look at what happens if you loop on all the different values of n

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
from 1 to 9 and print n and the number of edges in the clique.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
A graph with one node has no edges.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
A graph with 2 nodes fully connected has one edge, 3 has three--that's a triangle,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
4 has six, which is the square with the x through the middle of it,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
5 is that pentagram-looking thing that we just showed a minute ago,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and it continues growing up like that.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
With that as our insight, can we actually write down what the formula is

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
for a graph with n nodes?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Essentially what happens is each node gets an edge to each other node,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which we can write as each node has an edge to each other node.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Notice what happens if we use that as our formula, we're going to count this edge,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as it goes from this node to this node.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We're also going to count it again, as it goes from this node to this node.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We've double counted everything, so that should be our formula,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
which is Î˜(nÂ˛). Let's just double-check this.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If we print n, clique (n), which I counted by actually creating the clique,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
compared that to the formula n * (n -1)/2,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
you can see that it matches up perfectly.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So, really the answer that you should have given is this--

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
shouldn't have bothered with any of this creating of stuff.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now, in addition to all those graphs where the growth rate was linear, we now have one that's quadratic.
