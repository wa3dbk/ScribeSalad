00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.620
So the trick for doing algorithms like
Value Iteration in infinite state space

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.980
like what you get from the belief MDP is
going to come only by looking really,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.450
really, really carefully
at the infinite case and

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.950
then showing that we can be
represented in a finite way.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.310
So what we're going to do now
is actually step through what

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.300
Value Iteration would
look like in POMDPS.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.430
And then piece by piece,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.220
we're going to convert that to something
that actually can be computed.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.790
So at first, it's going to be math and
then it's going to be an algorithm.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.790
So here's Value Iteration written
out and it's in POMDPS but

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.080
sort of doesn't really matter yet.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.230
We're going to define the value
function at step zero,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.490
as a function of the belief,
to just be zero everywhere.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.450
And then we'll say, for t greater than
zero, the value function for time stamp

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.100
t as a function of belief state b,
is going to be the max overall actions,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.000
the reward for taking that action in
the context of that belief state.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.630
Plus the discounted expected
value of where we end up right so

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.790
that we're going to observe
is an observation z.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.630
And so we're going to let sum over
all the possible observations

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.610
the probability that we make that
observation times the value function

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.910
at the previous time step for
the resulting belief state b prime,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.770
which is the what we get by doing
what we talked about on the previous

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.600
slide which we call the state
estimation for b, a, z.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.450
&gt;&gt; All right, that seems reasonable.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.540
I mean other than the fact that
r is not a function of b and

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.910
a that just it means
the reward you actually got.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.787
Right so let's, what is this, what
is this like, what is the reward for

00:01:32.787 --> 00:01:37.390
being being in the belief state b given
that we take action a, how can we

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.030
represent that in terms of quantities
that we're more familiar with?

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.175
&gt;&gt; By unrolling probabilities or
something the same way we did last time.

00:01:43.175 --> 00:01:46.450
Yeah and in particular all we have to
do is say well you know we would get

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.210
the reward for
state s we were in state s.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.600
So let's just sum overall states the
probability we're actually in that state

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.790
the reward that we would
get from that state and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.660
of course this is just the belief
state for for state s.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.220
So this is really just the dot product
of the belief state with kind of

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.541
a vector that you could make out
of the rewards for a given action.

00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:11.920
&gt;&gt; So, it really is just the the average
award you expect given the belief state.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.730
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.620
&gt;&gt; And so again now that we've
got that out of the way,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.860
the scary thing here is this function
v this value function is defined over

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.390
an infinite set of belief states, these
vectors of probabilities over states.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.420
So again we're not going to let
that scare us quite yet, but

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.520
it is something we have to keep in mind.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.550
Otherwise, we could just
implement this directly.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.530
All we would need is
a loop that would say for

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.950
all belief states do this update.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.560
It's just that there's
an infinite number of them so

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.700
that would not terminate
&gt;&gt; Yeah but

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.555
you could write it in really
just a few lines of code.

00:02:42.555 --> 00:02:46.160
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, you could write an
infinite loop in very few lines of code.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.680
&gt;&gt; Beautiful really.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.130
&gt;&gt; This is how we're going to jump from

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.730
the infinite to the finite is we have,
we're going to make a claim.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.430
And the claim goes like this, that for
all t, the value function times steps t,

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.140
over all belief states b,
right so this is over

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.290
the infinite set of possible belief
states, can be written in a finite way.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.040
In particular, the maximum over

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.490
some set of vectors gamma sub t that
we're going to have to deal with later.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.630
But the point is that it's
a finite set of vectors.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.760
The maximum of the dot product of

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.780
the vectors in that set
with the belief state.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.680
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Where

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.990
a dot product is really just
the sum over all the states,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.420
the weighted probability being
that state times this alpha of s.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.110
So this kind of function is sometimes
called piecewise linear and

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.120
convex and the reason is, that if we
actually, if we think about belief space

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.770
as being well it's just a really
simple one, like the space of

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.780
probability distributions over
just the two possible states.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.590
So we have some probability
between zero and one and

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.620
if probability one represents we're
totally definitely in state S1

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.300
otherwise if the probably zero,
were totally definitely in state S0 and

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.550
in between where in between there some
probability of S series some probably

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.280
of S1, In the halfway in
between would be half of each.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.940
Okay?
So what

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.399
functions of this kind have in common
is that each of these alpha times b

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.260
is a linear function
of the belief state.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.950
All right?
So

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.520
each of that alphas in
the set capital gamma sub t

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.660
is some linear function of the belief
state and what we're going

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.260
to do is we have a whole bunch of them
at any given belief state b what we're

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.200
doing is we're taking the maximum value
of all these possible linear functions.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.160
So at the end of the day the actual
function that we've represented

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.860
is this upper surface of
these linear functions

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.650
each of which is defined
in the set capital gamma.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.990
Does that make some sense?

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.440
&gt;&gt; Sure, makes me think of something
you did in the last class.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.100
&gt;&gt; What was that?
&gt;&gt; Well,

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.680
when we did the game theory stuff.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.360
Remember that?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.080
&gt;&gt; Yes, so right,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.440
so maximums over linear functions
comes up in game theory as well.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.180
Yeah, it's a good point.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.590
&gt;&gt; And there they end up
looking very piecewise linear.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.920
&gt;&gt; Yep, and convex, right?

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.140
They open upwards to the top.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.600
And that's because of the max and

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.640
the piece has linears because it's
a finite set of linear functions.
