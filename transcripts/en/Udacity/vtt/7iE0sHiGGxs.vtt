00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
Well the kernel, as we've written it, uses 32 by 32 threads, or 1,024 threads,

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.612
and the limit on my machine is 2,048 threads.

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:12.095
That's keeping us down to no more than 2 thread blocks per SM.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:18.721
The kernel requires 7 registers for each of those threads, so that's a total of 7,168 registers.

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:23.559
The limit is 65,536 registers per SM.

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:28.949
So this is limiting us to no more than 9 thread blocks per SM. This is not the limit.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.506
The kernel is requesting 4 kilobytes of shared memory to store the tile. The limit is 48k.

00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:41.880
So, this is restricting us to 12 blocks per SM, That's not our limiting factor.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.109
And finally, there's a limit of 8 thread blocks per SM total, and that's clearly not the limiting factor.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.553
So in the end, the thing that's keeping us from running more thread blocks per SM,

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:58.181
and therefore keeping us from running more threads per SM is this first limit,

00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:00.265
the maximum number of threads per SM.

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:04.027
We're limited to running 2 thread blocks per SM,

00:01:04.027 --> 00:01:09.918
and that means that we're going to be running a total of 2,048 threads on each SM.
