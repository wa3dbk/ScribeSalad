00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.200
The stage set for the Andrew File System, AFS, is

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.110
the CMU campus. And the user community can access

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.330
file servers using workstations connected to a local

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.500
area network. And as I mentioned, local disks on the

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.810
workstation served as efficient caches. And the vision of the designers

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.390
of the Andrew File System and the Coda file system, both of which were built

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.510
at CMU for enabling the student community to

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.870
access a central file system, is as follows.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.820
A user walks up to any workstation and, and logs into the work station. And your

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.170
content magically appears on this workstation from the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.740
central server as soon as you log in.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.890
In other words, in the CMU experiment, what they wanted to afford the users

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.580
to be able to do is have this ability to walk up

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.810
to any workstation spread out throughout the campus and be able to

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.880
access their personal information that is stored

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.090
in servers that are central to the entire campus. Isn't that what

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.300
today's cloud computing and mobile devices are trying to do to your

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.640
content? In some sense you'll see that many of the technologies that

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.670
we take for granted today had their modest beginnings in

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.030
experiments such as the Andrew File System and the Coda file system at CMU.
