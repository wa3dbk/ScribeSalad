I want you to try this. I'm going to give you a list of life events and I want

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.300
you to place them on the number line according to the amount of stress you

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.891
think they cause. So we have death of a close family member, vacation,

00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:14.380
retirement, marriage, begin or end school, death of a close friend, divorce and

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.040
pregnancy. Each of these correspond to one of these numbers on the scale. Where

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.768
do you think they go? Put the appropriate letter under the appropriate number

00:00:24.768 --> 00:00:28.800
on the scale. Don't worry if you get this wrong. I had a few people try this,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.480
and almost everybody came up with different ratings.
