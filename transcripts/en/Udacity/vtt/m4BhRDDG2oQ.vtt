00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What I'm going to do now is go over a fixed-sized queue data structure

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that's going to serve as a running example for some of this lecture,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we're also going to keep using for a couple of our exercises for the next several units.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And the way this data structure works is it supports an enqueue operation,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a dequeue operation, an enqueue elements to dequeue and FIFO order.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The FIFO is first in first out--so if we enqueue 7 and then also 8, the first thing that we dequeue.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
will be 7 then 8, and if we try to dequeue again--if we try do dequeue an element

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
with an empty queue, we're going to get some sort of an error.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Okay, so that's all fixed-sized queue. Now let's look at some code. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So in the implementation site--what we have here is a Python object so it's called queue 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and the constructor for that object is going to set up the data structure because structure 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
for that object is going to take a size max argument--that's going to determine the largest

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
number of objects that can be stored in our queue and it's going to set up the data structure.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So first it's going to make sure that size max is greater than zero.   

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's going to save a temporary copy of that, initialize some head and tail pointers,  

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
a size variable which stores the number of objects currently in the queue,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and finally we need to reserve some space for the queque elements themselves.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But you can see here is we're allocating a Python array and so one implementation option

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
for a queue in Python will be to just use a Python list and that will be basically trivial.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Python list already is pretty much need of a support enqueue and dequeue operations    

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and the problem with the Python list is they're dynamically allocated,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
they are dynamically tight and that makes them not very fast.   

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And so by allocating a fixed-sized storage region of statically tight memory,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
where the "i" here means that our queue is only going to be able to store integers   

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
we can avoid some of Python's dynamic checks that makes the queue slow   

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and so in some cases, a queue based on a Python list is perfectly fast but on the other hand  

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
in some benchmarking that I did, this statically sized, statically tight queue

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
is more than 10 times faster than a queue based on a Python list. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So the first method that queue supports is the empty method and this simply returns true if

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
self.size equals zero--so of course the empty queue is the one that currently contains zero elements. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Very similarly, the full queue method returns true if the current size of the queue

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 is equal to the maximum size of the queue.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So now let's look at a couple of routines that are slightly trickier. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The enqueue method is going to take an argument x.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
X is an integer that we want to try add to the queue.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The first thing this method is going to do is check if the current size of the queue 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
is the maximum size--if so the queue is full, then we're going to return false.  

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If we passed this test, of course, the queue is not full and we have room.  

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So the next thing we're going to do is put the argument data item

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
into the queue at the location pointed to by the tail.    

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And so now let me show you a little bit of about how our representation works.  

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So for demonstration purposes, we're going to look at a 3-element queue

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and initially it's going to have a head and a tail according to the first queue element--

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that is the queue element with index zero and also its size is going to be zero.  

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
To enqueue an item, the first check will be useful--no it's not because its size is zero. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
We go ahead and put the item--let's say it's the number 7 in the queue element pointed to by the tail

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We're never going to increment the tail, and now the last thing we have to do to enqueue

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
an element is increase the size of the queue to be 1.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Okay, now let's go look back at the code. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Seeing here at the code, we can see that we put the element in the queue,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
we increased the size of the queue, we moved the tail to point to the next element  

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and the only thing that's left the only bit of logic that's sort of tricky here is

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
if the tail of the queue point passed the end of the queue--that is to say if it's equal to the max

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and so remember what the zero index array, the maximum way in is going to be one pass

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
at the end of the queue--we're going to reset the tail to point at the zero element of the queue--

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
that is to stay at the beginning.   

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Now the dequeue operation is very similar--first if the size of the queue is zero then the queue

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
is empty, we're not going to be able to dequeue an item.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And so what we're going to do in this case is return Python to none type.   

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So none of the special data types supported by Python we can often use to indicate

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
that we don't have anything--we don't have any actual value.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So if we pass that test, then there is something to return.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So what we're going to do is store the item from the head of the queue in a temporary variable.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So x is going to get 7. We're going to decrement the size of the queue.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
We're going to move the tail point out to point the next element and then using logic very similar

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
to the tail pointer in the enqueue function, we're going to wrap the head pointer around

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
if it's gone passed the end of the queue.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So let's go back to the drawing and look out and see how this plays out.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So we're going to return 7, decrement the size, and make the head element 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
point to the next element of the list, and we're not going to bother erasing the 7 we returned 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
but we're going to have to make sure that our queue logic never returns this dead element.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Oh! So let's take a very quick quiz just to make sure that you understood all of that.
