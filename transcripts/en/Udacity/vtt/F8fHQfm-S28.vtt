00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.609
So what's an incubator?

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.805
So, incubators have been around for
a long time.

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:10.480
Idea Lab, back in the early 2000s and
1990s was one of the first ones.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.910
And what incubators are,
it's a group or kind of an organization

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.300
that has their own ideas, but
they need teams to build those ideas.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.977
So in a sense what you're doing in
an incubator is you're going to work for

00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:27.792
a holding company that has ideas and
you're going in building those ideas.

00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:32.139
Now if the ideas take off and
that business becomes successful,

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:36.094
then they spin out and
then they become a private company.

00:00:36.094 --> 00:00:38.784
But initially, you're going to work for
somebody else.

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:40.374
You're working on their idea, and

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:43.610
you're trying to get to a point where
it can eject from this mother ship.
