00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.180
For this quiz, I want you to take
a look at the hometown hero image and

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.500
the navigation links, NEWS,
EVENTS, CULTURE, and BLOG.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.380
Start with a small viewport and
resize the page to make it larger.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.890
Pay attention to the size
of the hero image, and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.580
the spacing between the nav links.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.260
As you play with it I
want you to ask yourself,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.370
where would you add a breakpoint?

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.970
Type your answer in here and
just to be clear,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.690
there's not just one right answer, this
is as much of an art as it is a science.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.720
Oh, and here's a hint, if you open
up DEV Tools and resize the page,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.490
you'll notice that the resolution is
displayed in the top right-hand corner.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.800
That'll help you find out where
you want to put your breakpoint.
