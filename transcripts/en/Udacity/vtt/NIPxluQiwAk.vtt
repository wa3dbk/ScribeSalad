The first time you log into Salesforce, there's a lot on the page, and it can be

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.850
a little bit overwhelming. That's a good thing. That's

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.690
because there's so many things that you can do.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.370
Feel free to explore and click around. As

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.080
you build apps, you'll often come back to the

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.300
setup area, so you can find the setup link

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.090
at the top of the page and reorient yourself.
