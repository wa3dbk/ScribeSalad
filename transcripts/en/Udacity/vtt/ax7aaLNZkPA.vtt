00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.550
Let's look at an example. A lot of times where you

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.270
find yourself in a situation, where you need to get creative, you're

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.820
probably going to need to scrape data from a website. In

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.950
my experience, this is most often the case when the data is

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.360
provided by a government agency of some kind, or maybe a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.350
small grasssroots organization. In this case, the example I woild like to

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.010
look at is from the US bureau of transportation statistics. So,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.290
imagine we have a need for among other things to get statistics

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.270
on how many flights individual carriers have. To and from

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.080
the airports in the United States. Okay, now this particular

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.870
page provides us with a way of getting at that

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.850
type of flight data. That is, how many flights say Virgin

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.520
Atlantic has into and out of Boston Logan Airport. But

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.790
in order to get it we have to go through a

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.540
lot of work and a lot of manual effort if

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.250
we want to pull all the data for all the carriers.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.310
So this is a great example of a situation where we would

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.900
problematically deal with this problem. Okay now I've got this zoomed in

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.540
big enough so that we can see what's on the page and

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.500
as a result the layer is falling apart a little bit so bear

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.740
with that. So, let's take a look at how we would use

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.550
this site. Now right now, this is providing for us, the number of

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.810
domestic and international flights for all carriers, US and foreign, with a

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.370
destination of any airport. So, if I want to get just the data

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.300
for Virgin America, and all of the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.750
flights for Virgin into Logan Airport in Boston,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.980
I can make those selections and click submit. And here we have just that data.
