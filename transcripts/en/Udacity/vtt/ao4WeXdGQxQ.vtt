00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you. Here comes the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer, of course, is you put the part back in,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and you try to remove other parts. Why is that so?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well, if you remember our discussion of the scientific method in the first unit,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
what you just had is you set up a hypothesis on why the failure occurred.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You removed some part, and you observed that after removing this part,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
your hypothesis on what the failure is no longer holds,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so you go back to your earlier hypothesis and remove other parts.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Trying to keep only the part and remove everything else makes little sense,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and keep on removing until the failure occurs again also is very unlikely to happen.
