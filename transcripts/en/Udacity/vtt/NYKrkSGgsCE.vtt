00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, in our final programming exercise,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I want you to put everything together and build a particle filter.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm supplying you with code that has as gaps

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
pretty much the 2 functions you just programmed--move and sense,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and some additional code that I copied from class--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the particle filter code that you're familiar with and also code

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that helps you test your routines so you can make sure they're correct.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The key new thing you have to do is you have to work on the noise.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There is now bearing noise and steering noise and distance noise.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The code that you wrote didn't have any of those.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I want you now to modify your procedures to accommodate this noise--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
steering noise, distance noise, and bearing noise--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and all of it should be Gaussian.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's go all the way to the end. There are two test cases.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The first test case, which are uncommented so we can run it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What this is is it creates a sequence of robot motions.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
At each of these time steps the robot turns a little bit and moves forward.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It also has 8 measurements, which are the bearings to the those 4 different landmarks.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If I go up a little bit in the code,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
then you'll find that the ground true final position was 93, 75, and 5.2.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
When I run it, it runs the routine particle filter with those motions

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and those measurements as an input.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It produces an estimate, which is 94, 71, and 5.2,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
which isn't exactly the same as up here, but it's close.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This is a particle filter working.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I'm supplying quite a few functions for you. You should look around.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
One is called particle filters.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That's exactly the same code we used in class and constructed together.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I just copied it over, so if you look through this you'll find, hopefully, no surprise here.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm also supplying you the measurement probability function, which is part of implementation.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
let's just go there.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Here is the measurement probability function. There is something non-trivial here.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I compute the predicted measurements,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and then I compute a Gaussian that measures the distance between

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the measurements passed into the routine

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and the predicted measurements computer over here.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That's all happening down here. Here's my Gaussian function with the exponential.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Then I return my Gaussian error. There should be no surprise here.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
What's important is a little modification to the sense function that we haven't seen before.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I can now give the sense function a parameter, and I give it the parameter 0.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It switches off the noise model, so you will need the noise model

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
for forward simulation of the robot,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
but you don't need it for computing the probability of the measurement.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It augments your sense function to have a flag

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that if it's set to 0 it switches off the noise modeling

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and gets you the predicted best possible measurements.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
What you have to do is you have to find the part in the code

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that says "only add/modify code below here."

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You have to copy over your move function and then work in,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
as it says in the instructions, the steering noise and the distance noise

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and it's Gaussian--I hope you know how to do this.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Then you also have to plug in the sense function,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and you also have to plug in bearing noise and make sure there's

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
a flag that allows you to switch off the bearing noise.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It should be an optional flag,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
so it has to have a default value of the bearing noise being on.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Otherwise your code won't run.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Here is how we will test your code.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
If you go to test case number 2,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
then I wrote a few extra functions for you that allow you to test your particle filters

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
on many, many instances just like the ones we were using

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
for testing that are all randomly generated.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Let me just go through that code line-by-line.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Our test case will be 8 steps long.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
There is the same motions vector we had before of a slight turn on the circle.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
"Generate&lt;u&gt;ground&lt;/u&gt;truth" gives us a sequence of measurements and a robot position

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that we can split as follows, using a robot simulation.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Then you run your particle filter over here, and the function

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
"check_output" down here compares the final robot position, the ground truth position,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
with your particle filter position, estimated position, from here

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and gives us a single flag whether this is all correct. Let me just do this.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
We generate a robot that finished with final location 20, -29, and this orientation over here.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The particle filter came up with 22, -31, and 0.14, which is close to the original.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
My code check said "True." Let me run it again.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Different values--still true. Run it again. Different values--still true.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Now, it could happen that the code check says "False."

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I just ran it 20 times, and it said true for me every single time.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But I've seen it say "False."

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
The reason is it's a randomized algorithm. It's a particle filter.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It might actually not have a particle at the right place.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So when we test your routine, we're going to code our own code check, check_output.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
We have our own function for this, but we're going to run it multiple times.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
If you get it wrong once it's not a big deal.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
In summary, you will have comment out all the test cases again.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
All you have to do is supply the missing function. You can test the correctness yourself.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
You can basically grade yourself with this test case over here,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
but when you submit it, have those commented out,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
because we have our own test software.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
All we're going to test is whether your particle filter gives us a good estimate

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
when we choose randomly the initial position

00:05:20.000 --> 99:59:59.999
of the robots, measurements, motions, and so on.
