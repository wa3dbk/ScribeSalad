00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.817
I'm going to focus on Interactive 3D rendering in particular. Let's break that

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:09.326
phrase down starting from the end. This last word, rendering, means depiction.

00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:13.350
Well, it can also mean translating to another language, or turning animals into

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.095
meat, but let's ignore those definitions. An artist can render a scene by

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:22.114
painting it, an architect can render a building in perspective. And so on. To

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:26.298
render means to create an image. For the phrase 3D, this means defining things

00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:30.401
in a three-dimensional world. In the field of 3D computer graphics, you

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:34.840
mathematically define objects, materials, lights, and a camera. And then use

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.781
these together to render onto a 2-dimensional screen. Your monitor becomes a

00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:42.544
window into this world that you've created. Even newer smart phones have 3D

00:00:42.544 --> 00:00:46.099
graphic accelerators in them. You've undoubtedly seen video games and special

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:50.470
effects in movies. These are two of the most obvious uses of computer rendering

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.733
techniques. There are a vast number of other uses of 3D rendeing that effects

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:58.520
how the world works. Architects commonly create 3D graphics presentations for

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.290
their own benefit and for clients. Engineers use rendering to help show

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.159
potential problems with their designs. Doctors use 3D reconstructions from

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.650
medical scanning devices to understand patients problems. Even lawyers will

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.611
employ 3D animations to help explain accidents or other events. Interactive

00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:18.212
means you can instantly influence what you see on the screen. Video games give

00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:21.928
us obvious examples. You turn the wheel left in a racing game, and go that

00:01:21.928 --> 00:01:26.836
direction. Compare this to say, playing a DVD. There's perhaps, some minimal

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:31.015
control that could be considered interactive, pause, fast forward and so on. But

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:34.200
you're not affecting the world itself in any way. Drawing these lines is

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.875
interactive, I'm affecting what I see, but it's 2-dimensional. By Interactive

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:43.035
3D, I mean that the users actions affect something in a 3D virtual world At the

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:47.455
least, you move the camera to the world, possibly affecting objects and lighting

00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:51.338
as you go. This program by James Gow shows MRI data of how the brain is

00:01:51.338 --> 00:01:55.958
stimulated when exposed to different objects and actions. On the right is the 2D

00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.136
system for picking an object, on the left you then see the area stimulated. You

00:02:00.136 --> 00:02:03.048
can also change the view and with the slider, control how the data is

00:02:03.048 --> 00:02:07.390
represented. I asked Jack Galiant, who helped with this program, about how much

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.102
of the brain is dedicated to processing what out eyes see. The answer is, that

00:02:11.102 --> 00:02:15.233
more than a quarter of our brain is involved in interrupting visible signals. I

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:19.265
should note that there are other areas of computer graphics having to do with

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:22.884
images but are not truly 3D rendering. For example there's a complementary field

00:02:22.884 --> 00:02:26.816
called image processing. Where you use the computer to analyze photographs or

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:31.040
other images and try to extract a mathematical description of the world from

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.710
them. Though graphics hardware can definitely accelerate image processing

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.019
operations. We'll mostly be focused on 3d rendering in this course.
