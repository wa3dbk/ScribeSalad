Welcome to unit 7. This unit will start with a brief summary of the course,

00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:07.350
recapping the major themes we've seen. Then the rest of the unit will be all fun

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:10.975
field trips and interviews. We'll start by looking at the past of computing by

00:00:10.987 --> 00:00:14.700
visiting the computer history museum. Then we'll look at the present and how you

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:18.450
can contribute by visiting SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and talking to

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:22.482
the folks at Mozilla and Benetech. Finally we'll get a glimpse into the future

00:00:22.494 --> 00:00:26.160
of computer by visiting UC Berkley and looking at what people there are doing

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:29.992
research on. We'll start by summarizing the course, and I want to highlight the

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.762
three main themes that I think are most important in computing.
