00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's an example of how it all works.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This I've actually typed into the Python interpreter.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I've defined a function f as a lambda expression. It looks like this.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Then I've asked what F is.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
All Python prints out is it says that it's an object of type function,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which doesn't have a name other than the lambda

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and the address and memory where it's stored.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Then I'd say, is F true of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That is, Y is equal to 1, M is 2, E is 3, U is 4, and O is 5.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The answer is no, it's False. This is not equal.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Then I asked is it true for 2, 1, 7, 9, 8. Yes, that's true.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The reason is because it works out to this expression 289 equals 17-squared.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now I'm thinking of a design where we have some type of a solve function

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that's going to solve a formula, and we're going to have a compile formula function

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that's going to take a string formula as input and return a lambda expression function

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
as the result of compiling the formula.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
As part of that, I want to have a function that I'm going to call compile_word,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It's going to take a word like ME and compile that into something like 10M plus E.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You could have some variation on exactly how you want to express that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It will also take a word like equals and compile that into itself,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
into equals, and a word like 2 and compile that into 2 itself.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This is the function I want you to write.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Compile_word where compile_word of YOU is something like this--

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
don't worry about the communicativity and associativity.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You can write this any way you want as long as it is a code that would compute the right answer.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's important to put parentheses around it.

00:01:57.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Anything that's not an uppercase word you should leave alone.
