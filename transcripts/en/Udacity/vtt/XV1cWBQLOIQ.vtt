00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.320
All right, we've come nearly to the end of our course. What I'd

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.040
like to do now is summarize what I think are the high points, that

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.110
is the most important testing principles that

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.600
I've tried to convey in this course,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.820
and put them all in one place. So, let's go through these. First of

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.840
all, testers must want software to fail.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.590
Second, testers are like detectives who are

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.180
hunting down bugs. And as detectives, testers will have to be observant to all

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.050
sorts of suspicious behaviors and anomalies in

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.490
the software of your test. My guess

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.066
is that a number of really serious bugs that have occurred over the years.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.240
I think these had already been noticed by people and swept under the rug because

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.720
people were busy or they just wanted to ship the product or maybe they were

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.320
users who didn't know what the bugs meant. So regular users have the luxury of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.180
ignoring bugs, but testers don't, and so

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.880
it's really important not to sweep things under

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.760
the rug. All available test oracles should be used as a basis for testing. And

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.250
so, you might be tempted to think from the language that I was using, that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.060
is, strong oracles versus weak ones, that if we had a couple of good strong

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.770
oracles available, maybe we wouldn't need the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.080
weak ones, maybe we wouldn't just use them

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.168
at all. And as I hope I've convinced you by now, that's not

00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:54.120
the case at all. All of the oracles should be used because they

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.470
can all detect different kinds of faults, and even if they detect the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.560
same faults, weak oracles might be much cheaper to use. Test cases should

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.150
contain values selected from the entire input domain, and if there's doubt about

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.680
what exactly that domain is, this is something that will be good to

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.090
hash out with the developers. Interfaces that cross a trust boundary need to

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.070
be tested with all representable values, not

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.200
just those from the ostensible input domain.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.540
If we recall some of the examples we've looked at, if we are writing

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.080
a web server we might hope everybody

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.080
submits data that's well-formatted, but as its

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.590
most likely the case, they won't and the reason they won't is because they

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.880
will be trying to break into our Web site. Server. So we need to test

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.010
on that kind of data, to ensure that we can correctly reject it. Similarly,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.790
a piece of software like the Linux kernel has the trust boundary at the

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.420
system call interface, that is to say

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.280
the interface between user mode applications and

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.180
the Linux kernel. Linux kernel like the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.310
web server, can't trust that its clients are

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.450
going to make well formed requests all the time. It should expect

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.120
that its clients if not actually hostile, are at least buggy,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.900
and are going to do all kinds of, it needs to

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.610
catch that instead of crashing or violating its security policy. A little

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.280
brute force goes a long ways when we're testing. And what

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.640
I mean in particular is in certain restricted circumstances, we can

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.430
do exhaustive testing and almost anything else can be randomly tested.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.430
Quality cannot be tested into bad software. We saw the Therac 25

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.910
example, where the control software for

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.880
the radiation therapy machine was probably

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.880
so broken, that almost an, almost no amount of testing would have been

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.190
sufficient to make it right. It needed to be thrown away I

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.360
think I needed to start over. I'm sure we've all seen software that

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.320
looked like that. So in contrast with examples like a fair at

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.820
25, testable software has a few of the following qualities. No hidden coupling

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.870
between modules and side channels where

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.570
modules can share information without being

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.230
visible to the system developers. A

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.410
few variables but are shared between threads.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.700
Few global variables shared between modules. And no pointer soup,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.570
and that is to say, no huge data structures with pointers

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.950
going everywhere where it can't possibly keep track of who's

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.450
changing what and what's valid and what's not. Codes should be

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.510
self checking whenever possible using plenty of assertions. However, these

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.180
assertions are never used for error checking, rather they're used to

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.480
check for logically impossible conditions. It implies some sort of an

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.890
internal consistency violation. Assertions must

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.450
never be side effecting, because if

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.900
they are, and you turn them off, the system behavior will change,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.560
and this leads to madness among

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.770
developers. Finally, these assertions should never

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.460
be silly or trivial ones, because first of all, those serve no

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.590
purpose, second, they clutter up code,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.320
third, they make things slower, and finally,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.050
they fail to communicate useful information to the next person who looks

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.160
at the code When appropriate, all 3 sources of input to a piece

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.970
of software under test should be used a a basis for testing.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.670
And those include the obvious API's, provided by the software on your test

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.610
which can be tested directly. API's used by the software

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.020
under test can be tested using fault injections techniques. So

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.790
recall that these are things like substituting the library that

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.040
provides these API's with a different library the inject faults, well

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.935
perhaps just hacking the layer underneath to inject faults. Finally,

00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:39.980
non-functional inputs such as thread schedules need to be tested using

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.180
whatever method you can get that will work to actually

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.880
test these things. And finally, the last principle for testing is

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.280
that failed code coverage do not provide a mandate to cover the failed

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.270
items, no matter how tempting that might be, but rather, they give clues to

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.470
ways in which the test we did is inadequate. So, blindly coding to

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.170
the coverage metric is going to destroy those clues, but it's going to do it in

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.450
such a way that doesn't improve the quality of the test suite very

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.260
much. So taken together, this list of

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.030
items I've just given you constitutes pretty

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.350
much all that I know about testing. And the detailed version of these

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.030
has been the content of this course. This is material that I have never

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.870
taught before, so I hope it came out in sort of a fairly coherent

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.899
fashion. It's stuff that's been brewing in my mind for a long time. I've

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.690
wanted to teach it because I've noticed for years that we don't seem to

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.480
be doing a very good job teaching CS students to test. What happens instead is

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.295
they write small test cases in response

00:04:25.295 --> 00:04:27.330
to assignments, they debug them until they

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.410
pass the test cases we give them, hand them in and never look at them

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.952
again. And it's hard to think of anything less like the real world of

00:04:32.952 --> 00:04:34.842
software development than the environment we create

00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:36.105
in classes. So what I have tried to

00:04:36.105 --> 00:04:38.083
do is structure this course a bit little differently,

00:04:38.083 --> 00:04:39.459
tried to bring out thing that I feel are

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:41.136
really important that we often don't do a very

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:42.930
good job with. And this has been really enjoyable for

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.270
me, it's been great to actually try and set

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.270
this material down in a coherent fashion and I very

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.930
much hope that this material has been useful for

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.840
you and that the class has been enjoyable. Thank you.
