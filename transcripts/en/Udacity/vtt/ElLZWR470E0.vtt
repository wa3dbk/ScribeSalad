00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.655
Therefore, after we know the slope and a point on the line, we can find the

00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:09.710
y-intercept. After that we'll have an equation for the line. And once we know

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.150
this equation, we'll be able to find any other point on the line. And therefore

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.389
use our equation to make predictions. Here we know that since a point on the

00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:24.570
line is x bar comma y bar. We can plug that into our equation and now we can

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.430
solve for a by subtracting 0.2 times x bar on both sides of the equation. These

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:38.950
cancel out and we're left with a on this side equals y bar minus 0.2 times x

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.325
bar. Now that we have our formula for a, the y-intercept, find what this

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:48.030
y-intercept is for our regression line for flight costs.
