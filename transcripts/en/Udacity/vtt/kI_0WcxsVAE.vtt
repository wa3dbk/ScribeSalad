00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.480
Now that you have practiced using so
many new tools and

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.830
concepts, it's time to embark
on your final project.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.950
You will create a menu app with Flask
that lists out all the restaurants in

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.280
your database and allows you to view
the menu for each of those restaurants.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.970
Users should also be able to create,
read, update and

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.270
delete restaurants and their menu items.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.180
You will be the technical
lead on this project and

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.280
I will not be telling you line
by line how to write your code.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.080
Note that the code presented in these
next challenges will help you make

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.550
a basic final project.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.400
But I strongly encourage you to
go above and beyond by making

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.950
a unique creation that you can call
your own and share with others.
