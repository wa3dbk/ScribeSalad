00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the approximation factor here is a 2,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because the length of the shortest tour

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is larger than the weight of the tree.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And the solution that we output is twice the weight of the tree,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so it must lie somewhere in between here,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which tells you that this solution here

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is at most twice as large as an optimum solution.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So Dave can now be very happy

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because he has a factor 2 approximation algorithm for his problem.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Which, of course, should he ask you,

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
you can easily explain to him, because you figured out most of this by yourself.
