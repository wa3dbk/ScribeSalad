00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.520
There was so much you might have said here. And, if

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.730
you have any ideas that I don't mention, please share them in

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.120
the forum. To start, our data's from 2008. So, not only do

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.110
we need to account for inflation, but the diamond market is quite

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.590
different now than it was. In fact, when I fit models

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.650
to this data and predicted the price of the diamonds that I

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.430
found off a market, I kept getting predictions that were way too

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.460
low. After some additional digging, I found that global diamonds were poor.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.550
It turns out that prices plummeted in 2008 due

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.610
to the global financial crisis. And since then prices, at

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.285
least for wholesale polished diamonds, have grown at about

00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:39.430
6% per year, compound annual rate. The rapidly growing number

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.190
of couples in China buying diamond engagement rings might

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.280
also explain this increase. You can click on the links

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.300
in the instructor notes to learn more about that.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.620
And finally, after looking at the data on price scope,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.410
I realize that diamond prices grew

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.480
unevenly across different karat sizes since 2008,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.550
meaning that the model I initially

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.500
estimated couldn't simply be adjusted by inflation.
