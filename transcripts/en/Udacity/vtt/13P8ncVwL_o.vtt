00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.230
Next, we're going to learn about the statement syntax

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.170
in Jinja. The statement syntax is very simple, it just

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.100
looks like this. This is squiggle percent, and then

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.700
you have your statement, and then you have a close

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.435
squiggle percent. And then you'll often have an ending

00:00:14.435 --> 00:00:18.437
statement, which is surrounded by squiggles of course, and in

00:00:18.437 --> 00:00:21.290
the middle you have your output. For example, an if

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.740
statement might look something like this. So I'll say if

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.520
name equals, equals Steve, this is just a Python syntax

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.440
for an if statement. Notice there's no colon at the

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.950
end. Will print hello Steve. Else will print, who are

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.920
you? This whole thing is followed by the end statement

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.817
block. Which in this case just says end if. Now

00:00:40.817 --> 00:00:44.609
this whole thing is followed by the end statement block,

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.064
which in this case just says end if. In Jinja

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:51.140
we have to tell it when the if statement is over.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.850
So what this will do when this is run, if

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.330
the variable name Steve or if the variable named name

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.290
equals Steve, it'll say, hello Steve! Else, it will say

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.034
who are you? And this ends it. Let's go ahead and

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:07.350
see this in practice. Okay, I'm going to get the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.710
variable n from the request and n will be a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.622
number, and we're going to change this to be n

00:01:13.622 --> 00:01:16.510
equals n. Then we're going to go into our template and we're

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.180
going to change this. We're just going to work on the same

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.360
template here if you don't mind. We're going to change this to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.984
use a basic if statement. So if n equals one, say n equals

00:01:27.984 --> 00:01:34.238
one, else say n does not equal one.
