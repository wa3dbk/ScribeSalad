00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.400
So, the Python grammar is much stricter than the English

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.190
grammar or most natural language grammars. In English, if we say

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.560
something nongrammatical like me go to the store, another English speaker

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.900
might laugh at us. But they can probably understand what we

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.780
meant. In Python, the code must match the language grammar exactly.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.360
Here we saw when we tried to evaluate 2 plus without

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.590
the extra operand, we got a syntax error, that means it's

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.980
not grammatical. If we said 2 plus to someone in English

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.840
well they might be able to figure out that that

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.030
means the same thing as 2. In Python it needs to

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.350
match the grammar exactly. So now we're going to look at the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.680
Python grammar for arithmetic expressions. We won't see the entire Python

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.470
grammar here. But enough to get an idea of why the

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.232
expressions we've seen were valid and why the 2 plus is

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:46.770
not. So first of all, an expression is something that has

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.160
a value. We're going to start our grammar with an non-terminal expression.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.690
And we can make an expression by combining two expressions

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.810
with an operator. This is sort of like the sentence

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.590
rule we have for English where we could make a

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.390
sentence by combining a subject, a verb and an object.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.140
This is a lot more interesting though, because we have

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.070
expressions both on the left side and the right side.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.080
This looks kind of circular. Because we have other rules,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.410
it's not completely circular. This is what's called a recursive definition.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.570
We'll talk a lot more about that in a later

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.500
class, in unit six we will, but for now, we're going to

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.360
just see how we can use that to make the Python

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.590
grammar. And to make a good recursive definition, we need at

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.840
least two rules. We need one where we can keep going,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.260
using the same thing on the right side as the left

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.070
side. And we need one where we can stop. So, another

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.540
thing that an expression can be is a number. And this

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.980
is why we can make expressions like 1 plus

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.980
1. This expression will become a number which will become

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.710
one. The operator will become plus, and the other

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.100
expression will become one. So let's write a few more

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.900
rules to see how that works. So we can

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.990
replace the operator with plus. We can also replace operator

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.370
with times. And there's several more operators in Python.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.350
Those are enough for now, we just need those two.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.360
We can also make numbers. And the complete rule

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.030
for making numbers is sort of complicated, but let's

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.730
assume we know what numbers are. We can make

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.350
numbers any number of digits. There different rules to make

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.160
all those numbers, but we know what they are.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.450
So, this looks like a very simple grammar. It's

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.720
quite small, but it can express infinitely many things.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.130
And the reason for that is because we have expression

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.970
on both sides here. That we can replace an

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.890
expression with a derivative expression, and keep going. So

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.590
here's an example derivation. We can start with expression.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.980
We can follow the rule, replacing that with expression

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.280
operator expression. And then, we can follow the rules

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.560
again. We can replace the first expression with a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.070
number and replace that number with the actual number

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.000
one. And we notice the actual numbers are terminal.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.790
So, once we get to the number one, we're done.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.810
There's no more replacements to do. We can replace the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.540
operator with plus. Plus is also a terminal, and we

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.860
can replace this expression with a number, and replace that

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.520
number with the number one. So this is how we

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.450
got the expression 1 plus 1 in the Python grammar

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.620
and that's why that was valid. We can do a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.130
lot more than this though. Instead of replacing this expression

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.300
with a number, we can replace this expression with

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.420
another expression, operator expression. So we're going to use the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.570
first rule replacing the expression with expression, operator expression

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.110
here. I'm going to start abbreviating so Expr is an abbreviation

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.200
for expression. Op for operator and Expr but, we're

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.430
just using this rule. And now we can do

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.610
the same thing again, replacing this expression with a

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.580
number and replacing that number, let's say with number two.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.190
We could replace this operator with the multiplication

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.680
operator. And we can replace this expression with a

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.650
number. Or you could replace it with an

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.660
expression, operator, expression. Let's do that, and build increasingly

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.630
complicated expressions this way. We can keep doing

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.840
this. We are not done until everything is a

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.500
terminal. So let's say, we skipped a few steps here, but this could be 3 plus 3.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.300
So this is how we can build up complicated expressions

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.779
from very simple rules. So I am going to add one

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.690
more rule to our python grammar, that will be enough

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.030
to produce all the expressions that we have used so far.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.330
And that rule that we need is for parentheses. And

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.060
this is actually quite a simple rule. It just says

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.440
we can make an expression by taking any expression we

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.590
have and putting parentheses around it. So, this is a pretty

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.720
small grammar, but this is actually grammar that's powerful enough

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.100
to produce all the Python expressions we've seen so far.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.430
As well as infinitely many different expressions. We're not going to

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.040
cover the entire Python grammar this way, but this should

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.660
give you an idea of the power of writing our

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.480
grammar this way. So we're going to have a quiz to

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.720
see that everyone understands the grammar. So the question is

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.760
which of the following are valid Python expressions that can

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.300
be produced starting from expression using the

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.660
grammar rules. So here are the choices; there

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.070
are five possibilities, check all the ones that

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.630
are valid expressions that can be produced from

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.810
this grammar starting from expression. You can try

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.820
your answers in the Python interpreter if you

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.570
want, but first see if you can figure it out for yourself, which ones are valid.
