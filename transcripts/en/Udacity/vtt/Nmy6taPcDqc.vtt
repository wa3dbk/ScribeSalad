00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.580
So, you might be wondering if you
don't have a phone, what you can do.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.980
Well, Android Studio has
actually provided a way for

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.310
you to simulate a phone
on your computer.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.250
This simulated phone has a fancy
name called the Android Emulator.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.330
To start the Android Emulator,
go ahead and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.810
go up to the Run button and press Run.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.480
You'll see a small
loading circle down here.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.810
Now, whereas before I told you to select
the Choose a running device radio

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.900
button, you're going to want to choose
the Launch emulator radio button.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.790
And here is a drop down of all
the different types of phones

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.320
you can simulate.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.550
Right now you should only have one, and
it's most likely going to be a Nexus 5,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.910
which is the type of phone, and API 21
refers to the operating system level.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.350
And x86 refers to a particular
type of hardware configuration.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.930
Anyways, this is the name for
your simulated phone.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.270
And I'm going to go ahead and
click OK to start the phone.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.120
Now after about ten seconds, you should
see a black phone appear on the screen.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.240
You'll also see this window here appear,
which will show any sort of error

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.020
messages or
activity messages from the phone.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.239
Okay, so here's my black phone,
and I'm waiting for it to load.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.070
After a moment of that, I'm going to
see this Android loading icon.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.471
After a little bit more time,

00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:13.270
you should see this welcome
screen appear on the phone.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.220
To go ahead and start the phone,
swipe up from the bottom.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.983
Now it's trying to simulate an actual
phone, and the first time you load up

00:01:20.983 --> 00:01:24.360
an actual phone, you get all
these help icons and dialogues.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.325
I'm going to just click OK.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.550
Now, if all goes well,
your app should appear on your phone.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.850
It didn't for me, so I'm going to
go ahead and try to run it again.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.310
Okay, since the emulator's
already running,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.640
I can see it now under my
Choose running device.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.519
So I'll go ahead and click it.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.890
And I press the OK button.

00:01:42.232 --> 00:01:44.660
All right, and it loaded up
my code on my emulated phone.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.070
Now you should know that sometimes these
simulated phones don't always work

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.800
correctly the first time.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.153
For example, you might have this issue
that I had the first time when I ran my

00:01:54.153 --> 00:01:57.508
simulated phone where it would
just show the black screen or

00:01:57.508 --> 00:02:01.530
would just show the Android loading
symbol, and it wouldn't go beyond that.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.470
These are actually fairly common errors
when trying to start a simulated phone.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.479
And one of the reasons that we
suggest using a real device.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.470
That said, for
the most part they're solvable problems.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.570
So, if you are running into
those issues, go ahead and

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.760
look at the instructor notes for
how to deal with these situations.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.710
We've provided a link to
a troubleshooting document.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.450
Finally, since I have your attention,
if you're having difficulty with your

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.060
simulated phone, sometimes you have
clues in this error output over here.
