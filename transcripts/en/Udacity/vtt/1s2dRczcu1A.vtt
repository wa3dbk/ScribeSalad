00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's the routine. It's very short.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It goes through the measurements. It assumes it has as many motions as measurements.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It first applies the measurement as before. Then it applies the motion.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When it's done with it, it prints the output, and the output is interesting.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The world has a green, a red, a red, and a green, and a green field.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The robot saw red, followed by a right motion, and green.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That suggests that it probably started

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
with with the highest likelihood in grid cell number 3,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which is the right-most of the two red cells.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It saw red correctly. It then moved to the right by 1.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It saw green correctly, moved right again.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It now finds itself most likely in the right-most cell.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This is just looking at these values over here without any probabilistic math

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and any code limitation.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's look at the output--0.2, 0.1, 0.08, 0.16, 0.38.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Very correctly, then it would most likely assign this position to the right-most cell

00:01:04.000 --> 09:59:59.000
as should be, given the sequence of observations over here.
