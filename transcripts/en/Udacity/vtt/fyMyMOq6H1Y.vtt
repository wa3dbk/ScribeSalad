00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.810
Many sites and apps,
especially those built on PHP,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.280
Ruby on Rails, JSP and so
on, assemble the page and

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.266
all of its content as one before
sending it down to the browser.

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:18.620
Progressive web apps change this
model by separating the parts that

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.910
change often essentially the content
from the parts that don't change often,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.770
typically called the application shell.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.780
The app shell can download and
display the content and

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.150
may even store the content in a local
database so that it can operate on open

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.410
slow networks or even if there is
no network connection available.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.220
The app shell is the minimum HTML,
CSS and

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.620
JavaScript that is required to power the
user interface of a progressive web app

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.650
and is one of the component that
ensures reliably good performance.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.135
Its first load should be extremely
quick and then immediately be cached.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.700
On repeat visits this allows you
to get meaningful pixels on screen

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.759
without the network, even if your
content eventually comes from there.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.880
App Shell architecture separates
the core application infrastructure and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.610
the UI from the data.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.170
All of the UI and infrastructure is
cached locally using a service worker.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.270
So that on subsequent loads
the progressive web app only needs to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.620
retrieve the necessary data,
instead of having to load everything.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.400
Put another way, the app shell
is similar to the bundle of code

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.470
that you'd publish to an app
store when building a native app.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.870
It is the core components necessary
to get your app off the ground but

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.980
does not likely contain any data.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.450
Using the app shell architecture and

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.545
caching it's resources using a service
worker allows you to focus on speed,

00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:02.900
giving your progressive web app similar
properties to that of native apps.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.070
Instant loading, regular updates, and
all without the need of an app store.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.510
Service workers are powerful for
offline caching but

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.600
they also offer significant performance
went in the form of instant loading for

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.890
repeat visits for your sites or app.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.310
You can cache your application shell so
that it works offline and

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.740
populate it's content using JavaScript.
