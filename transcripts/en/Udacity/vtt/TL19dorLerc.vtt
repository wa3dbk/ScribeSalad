00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.194
We work with numbers, so of course, what are we going to do next? Let's work

00:00:04.194 --> 00:00:08.533
with variables. The variable just holds the place of a number. So this x could

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:12.937
just be like my 10. Here's another rectangle to represent this expression. One

00:00:12.937 --> 00:00:16.993
side or one factor is x, and the other factor is x plus 2. The sides of this

00:00:16.993 --> 00:00:21.477
rectangle represent the factors in this expression. Factors are simply numbers

00:00:21.477 --> 00:00:26.385
that are multiplied together. Here's the first number x and here's the second

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:31.197
number x plus 2. We know each of these is just a number because x represents a

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:36.177
number. So, here's one number this would be a different number. Using what we

00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:39.538
saw before, what do you think each of these areas are?
