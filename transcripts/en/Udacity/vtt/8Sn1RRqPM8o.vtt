Congratulations, you
now have all the basic

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.000
tools to help you start using
Version Control with your next project.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.750
As a reference for

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.170
you, below is a summary of the main
points we covered in this lesson.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.940
And remember Walter's game crashing
in the beginning of the lesson?

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.220
Hopefully, you can see how
Version Control could have helped Walter

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.870
find the bug in his code more easily.
