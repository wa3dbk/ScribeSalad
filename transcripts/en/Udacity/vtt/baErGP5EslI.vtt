00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.254
Now once an object is created, it will one day have to die, because that's the

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:07.535
ebb and flow of the universe. Now once it dies, we need to remove it from the

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:11.055
physics simulation, and can do so by calling the destroy body function on the

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:15.535
world object. Now we rap up this call in a remove body function so that

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:18.901
external systems don't need to know about the presence of the world object from

00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:20.760
box 2 D.
