00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.560
Now that we know what
Google collects and

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.770
what do they do with this information,
the next question to ask, again

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.370
in a privacy policy, is do they share
this information with somebody else?

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.206
And if they do, now who are they?

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:22.960
So if you opt-in, you agree to it, then
they can share it with the companies,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.580
Individuals, organizations,
whoever outside of Google.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.850
Google collects it, Google uses it, and

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.409
then they can share it with somebody
else if you choose to opt-in.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.550
They can share information about
people who provide support to your

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.300
organization, so domain administrators
and resellers and things like that.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.745
So information that you give to
Google can be shared with them.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:49.630
They can share it with
what's called affiliates and

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.950
other trusted businesses or persons.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.910
Of course they will say with
appropriate confidentiality and

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.380
security, but this is really
addressing the sharing part, okay?

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.640
So somebody is a trusted business or

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.490
an affiliate, they can share
the information with them.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.560
And finally they can share it with
the government for legal reasons.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.450
Google has been,
actually more recently, been good about

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.540
transparency of government requests for
legal reasons and

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.272
having to share what kind of information
with the government or law enforcement.

00:01:18.272 --> 00:01:22.720
But this sort of defines how the private

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.350
information about you is collected, used
by Google, and then shared by Google.
