The last area we're going to talk about in motivation in the workplace is

00:00:03.048 --> 00:00:07.424
perceived organizational support. Perceived organizational support is an

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.892
employees belief that their organization appreciates them and supports them in

00:00:10.892 --> 00:00:15.948
their contributions and their well being. Employees that feel that their

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:19.020
employer actually cares about them and supports them feel less stressed and

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.150
enjoy their jobs more. Than those, who feel that their employer doesn't care

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.980
about them.
