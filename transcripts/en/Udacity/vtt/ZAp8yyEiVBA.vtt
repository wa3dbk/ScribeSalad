00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.030
So, we just talked about goals and the goal state of the goals.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.800
In order to specify the goal fully, we need to not only specify the goal state,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.020
but also to specify the initial state.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.030
So, let's do that. Let us suppose that the initial state in this world is,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.640
that the robot is on the floor. Note, how I'm writing this. On is a predicate,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.310
that says this is a two [UNKNOWN] and I'm reading this as Robot On Floor. So

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.900
Robot on Floor, and the Ladder is Dry, and the Ceiling is Dry.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.460
So, this is the Initial state, this is the Goal State. Now we have

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.110
fully specified the goal. Let's now ask, how can the robot come up with a plan?
