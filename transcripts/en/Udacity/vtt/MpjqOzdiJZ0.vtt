00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.160
This brings us to the end
of our foundations lesson.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.270
Our goal here has been to
give you a solid basis for

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.160
studying machine learning.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.140
You now know where machine
learning came from and

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.070
where it sits in the broader
family of artificial intelligence.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.800
You now know the three major types of
machine learning that we'll cover,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.340
supervised, unsupervised,
and reinforcement learning.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.030
You now know some of the applications of
machine learning like robotics, trading,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.020
and health care, and finally, you now
know some of the basics behind model

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.610
building and machine learning,
like classification and regression.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.759
Next, we'll move on to model
building in more detail.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.870
I hope you're excited to get started.
