00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.972
End_Date minus Start_Date plus one would actually give you

00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:05.960
the length of the festival. Why? Well, let's think

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.910
of a one-day festival that starts and ends on

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.428
the same day. N minus start would give you

00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:13.560
zero, you'd add one. For longer festivals, the same

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.390
logic would apply. But the key thing to note

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.080
here is that you would use a formula to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.020
do something very powerful that you may not have expected.
