00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.442
To find the side link of a cube, we actually take a cube root of the volume. So

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:10.370
the cube root of eight would be the cube root of two cube. We need this factor

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.495
of two of third in order for us to take it out. Since this index is a three, we

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:20.477
need to group the three factors to take out the two from the radical symbol. A

00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:24.991
cube root really just send us a third power. We can think of roots and powers

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:30.550
and inverse operations of one another. Pretty neat, huh? We can apply the same

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.161
concept for taking the cubed root of 125. We see that a factor of five appears

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:40.348
three times underneath the radical, so we just have five. And for the cubed

00:00:40.348 --> 00:00:46.315
root of 343, we just have seven. Here is the list of some perfect cubes. These

00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:49.402
numbers are considered to be perfect cubes since we can take the cube root of

00:00:49.402 --> 00:00:55.358
them to get an integer. Like we saw before, 8 was the same thing as 2 cubed. So

00:00:55.358 --> 00:01:01.540
the cubed root of 8, or 2 cubed is just 2. You'll want to keep a list of these

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.458
perfect squares and perfect cubes close by since they come up frequently. Make

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:08.278
a list on a separate sheet of paper or use and index card but either way you

00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:12.773
want to be really comfortable with your perfect squares and your perfect cubes.
