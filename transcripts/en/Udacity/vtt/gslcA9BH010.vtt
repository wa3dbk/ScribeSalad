00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.835
Well, the answer would be no. When we look at 11x and positive 46, we can think

00:00:04.835 --> 00:00:10.680
about the greatest common factor between them. That greatest common factor would

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.940
just be 1. Because there's no other factor of 11x plus 46 in our denominator, we

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.034
can't cancel this factor with anything down here. This is another reason why we

00:00:21.034 --> 00:00:25.667
want to leave the denominator in factored form. At the end, we should check to

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:30.339
see if this is factorable and cancel any factors that appear in the numerator

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.519
and denominator.
