00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.210
Modify the existing code so that you display just the numeral 1 from the grid.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.930
You should pick out a piece of the text here that is a quarter of the width and

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.730
height of this square. I'm not going to tell you much about how to code it, but

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.485
here's a tip, if you want to look at demo code, you can always download it from

00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:18.742
GitHub or can examine it right in your browser if you dig a little bit in the

00:00:18.742 --> 00:00:22.630
browser's debugger. For example, here's where I found the oil rangle demo in a

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.580
previous unit using Chrome's debugger. To get back to the exercise, when you're

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.520
done, the view over the square should look like this.
