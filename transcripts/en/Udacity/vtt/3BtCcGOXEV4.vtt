00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's the quiz I'd like to give you--what I've provided is a queue code

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we've already seen and also three test functions.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The first test function is the one that I wrote and this is put here really quickly.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It creates a three-element queue, checks that it's empty that is to save.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It calls the empty method, and if it's not empty, that is to save.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If the empty method doesn't return true, we print test1 not okay and return.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Otherwise, we keep going. So we enqueue a 10, make sure that that succeeds.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Enqueue the value 11, make sure that that succeeds.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Call dequeue method which takes the first thing out of the queue that we put in

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which is 10, so we make sure that it's 10.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Dequeue the next element, make sure that it is 11, and now we check again that the queue is empty.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If all of these are true, then we print test1 okay. So, that's my test function.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You're test function are test2 and 3--so just make sure that everything works here.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We run the code and we see the test1 okay, test2 okay, and test3 okay.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So you're assignment is to write functions test2 and test3.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So just a little bit previously, I gave some examples

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
of several different tasks for the queue that were equivalent to each other

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
in the sense that if we run one of them then it would just about as good as running the other one.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So, if you remember, for example, we can enqueue some numbers

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and dequeue them and check if they are correct.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The queue code would behave exactly the same

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
if we do the same exact operations but with sleeps in between them.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So, you're going to do here is the opposite of what I was showing.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
What I want you to do is write test functions two and three

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
so they're not testing equivalent functionality in the queue.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This should be pretty easy but let me just go up and look at the code

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and we'll get some ideas about how that might work.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So, what kind of behaviors in the code could you trigger that I didn't trigger?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Well, it's pretty obvious. For example, I never triggered the four case for enqueue.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I never triggered the wrap around case, I never triggered the empty case for dequeue,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
nor did I trigger the wrap around case with the head point.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So, given those ideas, right functions test2 and test3 such that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
they are not testing equivalent queue functionality as the test1 function that I wrote.
