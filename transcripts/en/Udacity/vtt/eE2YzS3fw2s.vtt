00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.578
My name's Molly Mackinlay, I'm from Belleview Washington and I'm a senior here

00:00:03.578 --> 00:00:07.663
at Stanford. And I first got into computer science when I was doing a first

00:00:07.663 --> 00:00:12.161
robotics program at my high school. I didn't take any coding classes until I

00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:17.239
got to Sanford and I took CS106A, my freshman year, fall quarter. And I loved

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:20.777
it, but before that I thought I was interested in math, science, maybe

00:00:20.777 --> 00:00:25.108
engineering. And so I took an engineering course in the summer at Cornell

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:29.712
University, trying to figure out if that's something I was interested in. And

00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:33.060
there I got to tour their HCI lab, which is Human Computer Interaction, and

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.381
that studies how people interact with technology. And I was really interested

00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:42.718
in how to design technology for people. And make it something that was going to

00:00:42.718 --> 00:00:46.195
be both effective and really useful for them and that's what really got me

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:51.686
excited about exploring CS. Because computer science is all about designing and

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:55.407
solving problems that are going to be useful for the people that are using

00:00:55.407 --> 00:01:00.421
these programs. And so from there I took a lot of really amazing CS classes

00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:05.525
here. And from there I was sold. And I took the rest of the CS classes and had

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:07.550
a really great time with it.
