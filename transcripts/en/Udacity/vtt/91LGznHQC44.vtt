00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.730
So, that's all there is to
the algorithm, that's particle filtering

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.780
using sampling as a,
as a way of representing your densities.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.020
There are some details to
mention about how to do that,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.720
which we'll talk about later,
when we do if for tracking.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.160
But, before we do that, I want to
show you some interesting, sort of,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.990
robot vision applications be,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.380
because they they illustrate the use
of particle filters really well.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.600
And then we'll revisit
the pure vision tracking but

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.630
in the meantime I'm thirsty.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.370
I'm going to go get a drink so we'll
be back for the next lesson in a bit.
