00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.183
I'm going to argue, that the best answer to this is no. This code is already

00:00:04.183 --> 00:00:07.989
fairly complex. It's got two loops in it, lots of statement and it doesn't

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:12.100
handle lots of cases. So let's think about the cases that it doesn't handle. It

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.450
doesn't handle the case where the, initial days are in the same month. And it

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.146
doesn't handle that, because we're adding all the days in month one, to the days

00:00:20.146 --> 00:00:23.450
and if day two was also in month one, we're going to add that we're going to get

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.440
the wrong answer. We could handle this. Maybe we subtract the difference between

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.576
the days. We have a special case for that. Maybe we need to do something

00:00:30.576 --> 00:00:33.526
different with this loop to account for when the months are the same. But that's

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:36.868
painful. We're going to need a new special case. Adding one special case is

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:40.389
okay. There are other cases it doesn't handle. It doesn't handle the case where

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:43.914
month 2 is before month 1. And this could happen if the years are different, it

00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:47.034
would still be the case that the second date is after the first date even though

00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:50.054
the second month is before the first month. And this won't handle that

00:00:50.054 --> 00:00:54.014
correctly. The other thing it doesn't handle quite correctly is counting days in

00:00:54.014 --> 00:00:57.782
leap years. This loop where we add the days in year one we have to be careful

00:00:57.782 --> 00:01:02.021
depending on whether February is included, based on what month we're in. Whether

00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:05.732
we should pay attention to the days in year 1 or the days in year 2. There's a

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.498
lot of things it doesn't handle. We could definitely fix this code to

00:01:08.498 --> 00:01:12.014
handle.those. And, if you answered the second answer, I'd encourage you to try

00:01:12.014 --> 00:01:15.406
and do that. To try and turn this into a correct working program. And you should

00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:18.533
be able to do that, but our goal as programmers should be to try and find a

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.942
simple solution first. Something this complicated is very difficult to get

00:01:21.942 --> 00:01:24.945
correct. Once you start handling lot's of special cases, and I've seen lots of

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:27.940
discussions on the forum of people who try to handle all these special cases.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.850
It's really hard to get them all right and it makes the code very complicated.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.586
So let's start by thinking of a simpler way. Often the way humans solve a

00:01:33.586 --> 00:01:36.823
problem is not the simplest way, because humans are lazy. We want to find

00:01:36.823 --> 00:01:40.520
shortcuts, instead of doing things in a real, simple, mechanical way. On the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.990
other hand, computers are not lazy. Doing things in a simple, mechanical way is

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.234
great for computers. It makes the program easier to write, makes it more likely

00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:47.843
to be correct.
