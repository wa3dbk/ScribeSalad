This problem seems really simple. But this
division sign is what's really interesting

00:00:04.814 --> 00:00:09.351
about the problem. Dividing by a number is
actually the same as multiplying by the

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:13.289
reciporical. The reciporical of the number
is 1 divided by that number. So, for

00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:17.826
example, the reciporical of 3 would be 1
3rd. The reciporical of a fraction, a over

00:00:17.838 --> 00:00:23.286
b. Is b over a. This was actually true for
the number 3. We can rewrite 3 as 3

00:00:23.298 --> 00:00:29.173
divided by 1, since that's still 3. And
notice the reciprocal of 3 divided by 1 is

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:34.764
1 divided by 3 or 1 3rd So the reciprocal
of negative 5 4ths would be negative 4

00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:40.199
5ths And the reciprocal of 1 7th would be
7 over 1 or just positive 7. Now what we

00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:45.488
know that a reciprocal is let's go back to
this division. We said dividing by a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.397
number is the same as multiplying by its
reciprocal. So I can change 4 divided 2

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.570
into 4 times 1 half. So if I do 1 half
times 4, I know I should get 2. Whether we

00:00:54.582 --> 00:00:59.707
know it or not we actually multiply by
fractions right here 4 is the same as 4

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.045
divided by 1 and I got a result of two.
We're going to look more closely at this

00:01:03.057 --> 00:01:04.595
throughout the rest of the lesson.
