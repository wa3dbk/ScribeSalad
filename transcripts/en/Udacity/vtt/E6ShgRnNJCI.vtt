I need this for 16 because 4 times 4 is 16, 5 times 5 is 25. This one had an

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:10.565
area of 20. 5 times 4 is 20. This bottom side is the same as this top side, so I

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:15.890
should have 4 times 4 or 16, and then for over here, I have four for this piece,

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:21.080
and four for this piece, 5 for this piece, and 5 for this piece. 4 times 5 is

00:00:20.907 --> 00:00:21.907
20.
