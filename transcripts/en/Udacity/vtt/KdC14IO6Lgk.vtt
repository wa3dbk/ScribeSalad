00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.910
In this case there are multiple, correct answers. So you should have

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.800
marked several of those. So let's go through the list. Well this

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.970
is definitely not true. They are used for something. The second answer,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.880
is a correct one, because you can order, the use cases that

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.320
you planned to realize, according to

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.580
your prioritization criteria. So basically what

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.100
you're doing you're prioritizing either in terms of functionality. So you, you

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.680
can decide which piece of functionality you want to realize first in

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.430
your system. Or you can also prioritize based on the actors involved.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.530
Maybe there are some actors, maybe there are some user

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.580
roles that you want to support before others, and we'll

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.580
see some examples of that. The next correct question is

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.190
that they can be used for requirements elicitation. Why? Well

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.130
because used cases express what the system is supposed to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.490
do for each user. They're an ideal way to collect,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.110
represent, and check functional requirements. And we'll also get back

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.700
to this. And finally, use cases can definitely be used

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.160
for test case design. So why is that? Because each

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.500
use case represents a scenario of interaction between users and the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.470
system. So testers can very naturally construct test cases based

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.570
on use cases. And in addition, and most importantly, they can

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.320
do that even in the absence of code that realizes

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.490
a use case. So they can do it as soon as

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.740
they have the requirements. They don't have to wait until the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.150
code is ready. So this is not very a important point.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.400
So you can have your test cases ready even before

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.150
writing the code. And now for completeness. Even though this is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.787
not listed in the quiz. I also want to mention two

00:01:23.787 --> 00:01:27.040
additional uses for use cases. The first one is that use

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.080
cases can be used to estimate effort as we will discuss

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.710
in more detail in mini course four, when we talk about

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.770
agile software development. And they can also be used by

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.290
customers to assess requirements. Which

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.170
is another fundamentally important role of

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.640
the use cases. They provide a common language between the customers

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.850
and the developers which makes it easier to collect the right requirements.
