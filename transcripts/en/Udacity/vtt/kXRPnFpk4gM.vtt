Now that we have an idea about the different variables involved in experimental

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.720
studies, let's go back to our study about caffeine and reaction time. We're

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.300
going to vary the amount of our independent variable, which was caffeine, that

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.930
we give to different participants. That brings us to the different groups, part

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.150
of our sentence. Say we're going to use two groups. One group gets caffeine.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.510
And one group does not get caffeine. Why do you think it's important that we

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.890
have these two groups. Is it because we want to get a baseline to compare the

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.030
caffeine group to? Is it because some people might not want caffeine? Or is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.539
having two groups a bad idea and everybody should get caffeine?
