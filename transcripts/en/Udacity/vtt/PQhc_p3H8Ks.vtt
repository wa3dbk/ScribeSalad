00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.010
I think the, the most important thing that, that inspired me to start to

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.415
shoot Keep In Mind is that they they should have a very curious mind.

00:00:09.415 --> 00:00:09.770
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.760
&gt;&gt; They should have the ability to ask questions, to kind of formulate these

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.773
questions as it pertains to them, as, as they would see these questions being

00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:23.270
raised in their own lives. So if, if there's a problem they see with

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.100
the, with the, with the pieces that they are working with or with again

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.780
with the project that they're working with, they should, they

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.409
should try to they should try to ask these questions in

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.890
terms of and how they can understand for themselves. And

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.780
once they understand, once they know what is the, the, the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.250
gist of the question is, then they can go and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.280
use algorithms. Obviously it helps tremendously if you know, if you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.300
have experience about all the arguments that are out there

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.560
to attack these questions. But I think the most important ability

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.170
that, that you should have as a data scientist, and you,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.300
you could obviously improve throughout your, your career in this is

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.980
that you have this this inquisitive mindset, where, where you are

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.680
trying to ask the right questions while you are trying to, to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.920
see what is important. And you also have an overview of

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.080
what kind of data can support in the end, your conclusions

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.470
that you are going to draw draw with the help of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.150
these algorithms that you are going to use to solve these problems.
