00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.292
We need to find R of N of 1000. 
So that just means 60 times the square

00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:11.100
root of 1000. 
This is about equal to 1897.37.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.264
So this means that if Grant spends $1000 
on advertising, he'll bring in $1897.37

00:00:17.264 --> 00:00:19.649
in revenue.
