00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.420
The first example that we'll look at is how control and data transfer is

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.850
affected in zen for a network virtualization. Each guest has two I/O rings,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.110
one for transmission and one for reception. If the guest wants to transmit

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.275
packets, it enqueues descriptors in the transmit

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:25.990
I/O ring. And placing these descriptors in

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.480
this IO ring is via hyper [UNKNOWN] that then

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.140
provide for desktop systems. The packets that need to be

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.460
transmitted are not copies into zen, but the buffers that contain these

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.130
packets are in the guest operating system buffers. And what the guest

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.670
does is it embeds pointers to these buffers

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.670
in the descriptors that have been enqueued for transmission by hypervisor. So in

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.580
other words, there's no copying of

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.400
the package themselves From the guest operating

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.140
system buffers into [INAUDIBLE]. Because the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.260
pointers to the guest operating system buffers

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.390
have been embedded in these descriptors.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.690
And for the duration of the transmission,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.560
the pages associated with these network packets

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.670
are pinned So that Xen can complete

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.000
the transmission of the packets. Now, this

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.020
is showing interaction of one guest operating system

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.790
with Xen. Of course, more than one VM may want to transmit. And what Xen does

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.530
is it adopts its own draw bin packet scheduler. In order to transmit

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.510
packets from different virtual machines. Receiving

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.570
packets from the network and passing

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.820
it to the appropriate domain works exactly similar to what I described for

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.260
transmission except in the opposite direction. What xen does when it receives a

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.610
network packet intended for a particular

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.050
guest, it exchanges the received packet for

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:15.090
one of the guest operating system page that has been already provided to xen as

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.050
the holding place for incoming packets. In other words, in order to make things

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.660
efficient What a guest operating system will

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.000
do is pre-allocate network buffers which are

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.110
pages owned by the guest operating system. So when a package comes in, Xen can

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.960
directly put the network package into the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.860
buffer that is owned by the guest operating

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.010
system. And in queue, a descriptor for

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.120
that particular guest operating system. So once again,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.870
we can avoid copying in the direction of going from xen to the guest operating

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.770
system. So one of the cute tricks that xen also plays, is that when it receives

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.090
a packet into a machine page. Then it

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.550
can simply exchange that machine page with some

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.580
other page that belongs to the guest operating

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.350
system. And there again, is another trick to avoid

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.690
copying. Either the guest can pre-allocate a buffer,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.270
in which case, xen can directly put that packet

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.890
into the pre-allocated buffer. Or if xen receives

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.410
a packet into a machine page, it can simply

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.530
swap that machine page. For a page that the guest already owns so those

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.540
are two different techinques for avoiding copying

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.820
altogether in the reverse direction as well.
