00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.030
So one way of doing this is,
just compare that distribution

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.630
to the distributions of the word,
of the, of the images that you know.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.090
And you can do it as say,
like a, a scaler.product, right?

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.730
So just a histogram.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.450
If you normalize it to one, you can
think of it as a normalized vector, and

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.270
I can pair, unit vector,
I can compare unit vectors, for example,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.310
by taking dot product and
finding nearest neighbor.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.490
So, that's illustrated here.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.983
So I have some exampled,
d sub j and I want to,

00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:33.820
I've got some query, q, and
I want to compare them.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.881
And so, here are my two histograms.

00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:38.380
So my histogram here is 1, 8, 1, 4.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.950
My histogram over here is 5, 1, 1, 0.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.070
So remember,
it's the same set of words, right?

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.480
We're just going to say for all the
words in English, what's the histogram?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.720
For all the words in my collection,
what's the histogram?

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.410
And I'm just going to compare,
say a similarity.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.700
So here is one example of where I take
the dot product between the d and

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.350
q, divide by the length and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.980
that's essentially giving me
a similarity between them.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.758
And this is just written out for
i equal 1 to v,

00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:10.970
where the idea is that you
have v number of words.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.010
And again, we didn't talk about exactly
how you decide if what v should be.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.290
That's sort of part of
the art of doing this work.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.380
So that's essentially doing
a nearest neighbor look up, right?

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.780
Given some input,
nearest neighbor, all right?
