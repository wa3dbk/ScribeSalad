00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.130
I want to just take a step back to remind you what direction we're going in,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.710
the iterative process, and what our end goal is.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.560
One of the more common techniques to add context to our graphics and

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.119
data is the use of juxtaposition or comparison.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.601
In the case of our scatter plot, we want to draw attention to

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:25.008
the games involving the home team by making them red and slightly larger so

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.279
that someone reading our graphic could compare them to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.330
the games which don't involve the home country's team.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.540
Doing so leverages some of the theory of pre-attentive processing by drawing

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.900
the reader to those games which do involve the home team so

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.630
that the audience can implicitly compare them to every other game.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.620
Again, reminding you of the message of what we're trying to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.400
convey is one of globalization and capitalization.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.720
A priori, we may not know what effect making the home games red and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.030
slightly larger will have, and whether or

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.930
not the comparison it creates helps communicate our message.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.050
So let's go back to our web browser and see what effect this actually had.
