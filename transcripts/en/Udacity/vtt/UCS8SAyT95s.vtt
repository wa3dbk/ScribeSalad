00:00:00.111 --> 00:00:03.869
In CUDA this discussion focuses on the concept of a warp.

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:07.109
Now remember that a warp is a set of threads that operate in lock step,

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.516
all executing the same instruction at the same time on whatever data they happen to be processing.

00:00:11.516 --> 00:00:16.452
And it's general technique is called SIMD, that stands for Single Instruction, Multiple Data.

00:00:16.452 --> 00:00:18.987
This is a term you'll hear a lot in parallel computing.

00:00:18.987 --> 00:00:21.956
Computer architects have been building SIMD processors for decades.

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:26.697
It saves a lot of transistors and a lot of power if you can amortize the work used to

00:00:26.697 --> 00:00:32.931
decode and fetch and perform a single instruction against multiple pieces of data at once.

00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:38.676
All modern CPUs use vector instructions, and the most typical ones

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:42.177
on Intel CPUs are called SSE or AVX instruction sets,

00:00:42.177 --> 00:00:47.325
and these are ways that the CPU can execute the same instruction on multiple pieces of data at once.

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:50.253
Going back to a point I made at the very beginning of this lecture,

00:00:50.253 --> 00:00:55.426
on a CPU, if you're performing an SSE instruction in a single clock cycle,

00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:59.802
you're affecting 4 pieces of data. On AVX you could be affecting 8 pieces of data.

00:00:59.802 --> 00:01:03.975
These vector registers represent a huge amount of the computational horsepower,

00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:08.440
and if you're not using them on the CPU, then you're missing most of the power of your processor.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.640
Another term you'll see a lot is SIMT.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.844
This is a term coined by Nvidia to stand for Single Instruction, Multiple Threads,

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:22.224
and this is a subtle distinction that has to do with what happens when there is thread divergence.

00:01:22.224 --> 00:01:26.791
Let me explain what that means. It all comes down to what happens at a branch in the code.

00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:29.627
Here's some code with an if-else statement,

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:34.335
and I'll color the instruction stream black for instructions that all the threads are going to execute,

00:01:34.335 --> 00:01:39.937
red for instructions that only threads that take this branch in the if statement will execute,

00:01:39.937 --> 00:01:45.839
blue for instructions that only threads that take the else branch will execute, and black again.
