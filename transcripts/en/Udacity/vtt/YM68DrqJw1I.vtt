00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.130
You might be wondering why you should

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.780
be learning about exploratory data analysis in the

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.910
first place. Hal Varian, the cheap economist

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.940
at Google, said what's becoming ubiquitous and cheap?

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.890
Data. And what is complementary to data?

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.010
Analysis. In general terms, exploratory data analysis or

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.660
EDA. Is the examination of data and relationships

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.330
among variables, through both numerical, and graphical methods.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.000
It often takes place before more formal, more

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.720
rigorous statistical analyses. EDA is often the first

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.200
part of a larger process. It can lead

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.460
to insights, or new questions, or even feed

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.690
into the process of building predictive models. It's

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.300
also an important line of defense against bad

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.020
data. It's an opportunity to check some of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.720
your assumptions and intuitions about a data set.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.570
Many times, business decisions are made using unpolished

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.270
visualizations that come out of exploratory data analysis.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.910
Other times, you might polish some of those

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.850
visualizations or summaries before presenting them to a

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.500
larger audience. Let's hear from Chris about an

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.050
example of how EDA can fit into the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.780
larger process of building predictive models. A great

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.660
example of EDA comes from the Netflix prize competition.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.480
Teams competed for a million dollar prize to improve

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.130
the Netflix movie recommendation system by at least 10%.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.100
You can read more about the contest and results

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.910
By clicking on the link in the instructor notes.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.820
This visualization was created by Todd Holloway to show

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.310
clusters of movies based on movie ratings. Movies that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.200
are closer together, receive similar movie ratings, whether those

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.780
ratings are high or low. And it's exactly this

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.180
type of visualization that allows us to get a feel

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.210
for the data and determined what could be a part

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.660
of it and what could be explored in more depth.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.800
So, even before performing complex data analyses on the data,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.800
we can learn a lot about visualizing our data. Nathan

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.540
Yau, a noted statistician and visualization guru provides his reflections

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.780
about this plot. You can read his thoughts and check

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.560
out the interactive visualization from the instructor notes as well.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.940
So, whether you want to learn an in-demand skill

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.560
Or compete in $1,000,000 competitions. EDA has something to offer

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.770
to you. At the least, learning about EDA will

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.030
improve your ability to reason through data, sharpen your communication

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.330
skills, and expand your career opportunities. Now I want

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.980
you to take a few minutes to think about your

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.260
previous work and your educational experiences. Write a few sentences

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.930
about why you would like to learn about EDA And

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.670
once you've got your ideas down, share

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.540
your thoughts and your experiences in the forum.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.090
And remember, there's no right or wrong

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.050
answer here. This question is just for you.
