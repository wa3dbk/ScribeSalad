00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.370
And obvious question is why
worry about cyber security?

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.550
Actually, before we get into
the cyber side of things,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.035
let's talk about when or
why do we worry about security.

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:17.405
We worry about securing something, or
we worry about the security problem.

00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:20.045
When we have something of value, but

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:25.772
there also has to be a threat source
that poses some kind of a risk to it.

00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:30.684
So clearly you worry about security
when there's something of value, and

00:00:30.684 --> 00:00:35.472
you perceive that there's risk that is
posed to that thing that is of value.

00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:38.612
So let's get back to cyber security now.

00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:40.682
So let's ask those same questions,

00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:45.950
what is of value in
the context of cyber security?

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.950
And where do the threats come from?

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.520
What kind of risk are we talking about?

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.240
Who is the source of the threat?

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.130
In terms of what is of value,
all of us store a lot of sensitive data.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.960
If criminals, if they get their
hands onto this sensitive data

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.060
that we're talking about, of course
they can monetize it and profit from it.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.380
And it is no exaggeration to say that

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.470
societies actually rely on the internet
for really important things.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.430
So these are again critical
resources that we all rely on.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.720
Which could be attractive targets for
our adversaries.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.660
In this case the reasons may be
different from simply profiting from it.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.780
To look at sort of a quick example
of what we just talked about.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.930
In particular our
critical infrastructure.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.710
People talk about smart grids, they're
basically talking about the electric

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.810
power generation, distribution, billing,
all the different things that we do

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.750
to make sure that we have
electricity when we need it.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.500
If the computer is
controlling the smart grid,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.040
whoever sort of takes control of
those computers, is controlling

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.340
a extremely important infrastructure
on which the community relies.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.730
Obviously every business and
government agency now use computers and

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.610
networks to carry out what they're
supposed to do their daily activities.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.590
But what happens if hackers,
or adversaries, or

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.000
unauthorized parties gain access to it?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.430
So it's an easy argument to make that
cyber security is extremely important.
