This equation represents a circle. Nice job if you picked the circle. We know

00:00:05.428 --> 00:00:09.649
we have equal amounts of x squared and y squared, and if we move the 3y squared

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:13.937
to the left hand side by adding 3y squared to both sides of the equation, we'll

00:00:13.937 --> 00:00:20.884
get this equation. We have equal amounts of x squared and y squared, so we have

00:00:20.884 --> 00:00:25.666
a perfect circle. And notice, too, that we could divide each of these terms by

00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:30.177
3. When we divide the equation through via factor of 3, we'll get x squared

00:00:30.177 --> 00:00:37.237
plus y squared equals 9. This is a circle with a radius of 3 units. And just to

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:41.090
be sure I'll show you that each of these graphs are exactly the same.
