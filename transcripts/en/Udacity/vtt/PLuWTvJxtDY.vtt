I'm here with Jarrod Parkes who
is a course developer at Udacity.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.520
Thank you so much for
talking to us today, Jarrod.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.290
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.120
&gt;&gt; We're going to talk a little
bit about student isolation, and

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.580
especially student isolation as
it arises in online classes.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.190
I wanted to talk to Jarrod about this,
because, Jarrod,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.210
you have unique experience in three
different ways on this topic.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.030
One is as the student of online classes.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.250
One is as the designer
of online classes.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.835
And one is also as a remote employee.

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:23.680
Jarrod works for
Udacity in Mountain View, but

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.540
actually works out of
his home in Alabama.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.520
So that's kind of three interesting
takes on the angle of isolation.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.380
So let's start with the class, with
the experience as a student in a class.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.900
So what's your experience
being a student in

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.070
an online class where you might not be
colocated with your fellow students?

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.430
&gt;&gt; So every time that I've taken an
online class, I think one of the things

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.430
I quickly find myself doing is wanting
to share my experience with people.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.910
So whether I'm taking the class in
isolation, which is usually the case.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.750
When I'm done with whatever the lesson
is that day, or the content that I've

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.340
consumed, very quickly I want to
talk with other people about it.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.460
So for me,
I've always been able, luckily,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.180
to facilitate that with actual
in-person conversations.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.470
But I think for others, it's useful
to have a place to discuss topics.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.130
&gt;&gt; So is that a perspective you try and

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.040
incorporate when you're
designing courses?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.929
&gt;&gt; Is there a way we can
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.360
&gt;&gt; facilitate that?
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.220
I think any and every opportunity that
we have and that students want to take

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.030
advantage of that is discussion-based,
it's always beneficial.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.210
I mean, that really, I think,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.870
helps capture what is difficult
sometimes in the online education space,

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.050
is that you don't have the same physical
classroom that's traditionally always

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.010
been there, where people are having
these types of conversations.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.660
&gt;&gt; It's true that there's an absence
of that physical interaction,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.210
that face-to-face interaction
that we have right here.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.090
But, in your experience, is there any
instance where not only can the online

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.390
environment be as good as it might be
in person, but can it ever be better?

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.550
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.960
I think what the online environment
has allowed me to do personally, and

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.580
I think maybe some others as well,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.450
is that it allows me to put my head down
and just go straight into a topic and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.010
not have to weed through, say,
the conversation sometimes.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.199
So it's kind of
a mix-and-match approach.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.710
And, yeah,

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.600
when I want to learn a certain topic,
I can go and find it freely.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.626
And I think that's something that
is better inherently about it.

00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:19.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I think that one of my favorite

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.870
experiences with isolation in an online
classroom and the comparison to

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.800
an on-campus class is that on campus,
if I know there's a student question

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.765
coming up, or I know students
are confused about something, and it's,

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:31.940
you know, Friday night, and I just
finished a lecture on Friday afternoon,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.350
and I'm aware that
students are confused,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.890
I have to wait until Monday to get back
to them and talk to them about that.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.780
But what we have online is
what I call 24/7 classroom.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.190
It's always there.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.615
Students are always
available to interact,

00:02:42.615 --> 00:02:43.800
since they're always
checking their email.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.270
They can always visit forums.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.520
They always have a way that they
can interact with one another.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.600
As I mentioned this before in these
interviews, but I can have an experience

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.990
where I'll log into our class forum and
in five minutes I can interact with ten

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.500
different students and then come
back an hour later and do it again.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.030
And that's something we
can't really do in person.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.490
In person, we have this time box thing
and we have limited resources to meet in

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.662
person because we have different
classes and things like that.

00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:07.700
So there's a lot of things that we
can do online that actually can

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.140
break that isolation.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.670
But to your point, it's not something
that just happens automatically.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.680
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; It's something, yeah.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.960
&gt;&gt; And it's interesting.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.470
It's kind of like a dichotic state.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.590
I think students have moments in their
learning where they really want to be

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.380
in conversation,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.250
and then they have moments in their
learning where they really don't.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.450
And I think a lot of times as
you're taking online courses,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.870
a lot of that responsibility is
being placed on you as the learner.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.060
And I think for us as course designers,
if we can take some of that

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.300
responsibility away and facilitate the
times when you want to learn with your

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.960
head down to the grindstone or
when you want to have class discussion.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.569
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that need's really nice, too,
because I sometimes comment on what I

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.310
call a rule of 20s, which is if anything
is effective for 20% of the students in

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.720
a class, we should use it,
because 20% is a decent enough portion.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.020
But we're never going to
have anything reach 100%.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.006
And that's really nice here, because it
means that those 20% who are, or more,

00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:58.310
who are going to get a lot out of
class discussions can do them.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.950
But those who really don't
get a lot out of them don't

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.790
have to sit in the classroom
listening to them.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.350
&gt;&gt; Right.
And,

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.930
I mean, I think a lot of students
experience this at an early age, for

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.580
instance, in traditional classrooms
where the conversation is something

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.550
you already know.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.310
A lot of people enter a grade
school at very different levels.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.970
And so if you don't skip a grade or you
don't get into the accelerated program,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.209
you get bored, and
that's not good for students.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:19.940
&gt;&gt; That's a waste of time.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.730
And I think that students learn over
time that if I'm not consistently

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.600
being challenged, that school is boring.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.510
And that's definitely not
what we want them to learn,

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.250
because eventually
school won't be boring.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.880
Eventually, you know, they'll get to
the level that they're ready for.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.390
But we don't want them to have learned
that they can skate through until then.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.460
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.230
come tell a little bit
about your experience,

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.400
if you don't mind, also as a pay remote
employee, someone working at a distance.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.650
Is there a similarity between being
a remote student and a remote employee?

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.600
&gt;&gt; I think there are similarities in the
fact that I feel like I need discussion

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.850
as a remote employee, whether that's
facilitated through online chat or

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.038
if I can just talk to a friend.

00:04:58.038 --> 00:04:59.980
So, you know,
where I work from in Alabama,

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.550
I try to do my best to create
a space that is kind of the office

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.460
that's very separate
from what is the home.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.690
And then I've also tried to force
myself during the day to go out and

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.780
have conversations with people,
even if it's just over lunch,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.140
because if I don't do that,
I feel like I've been in a cave all day.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.150
And it drives motivation down.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.770
The same kind of motivation maybe it is
for learning, I feel like it drives my

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.690
motivation down for producing good
material and doing good work.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.220
&gt;&gt; I think nowadays we also are,
have the benefit of a lot of really nice

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.930
tools around these programs
that we have, our class forums.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.450
I know that the OMSCS
program uses HipChat.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.710
We at EDSC use Slack.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.457
And there are some really nice
tools that can kind of try and

00:05:39.457 --> 00:05:43.009
to recreate that environment of being
in an office or being in a classroom.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.622
That I always have people at my
fingertips that I can talk to or

00:05:45.622 --> 00:05:48.594
I can always post a message right
now while I'm thinking about it that

00:05:48.594 --> 00:05:51.052
people will see when they have time,
as opposed to, oh,

00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:54.200
I need to remember to bring that up on
Monday when I get back to class, so.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.942
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one of those,
it's like that strange,

00:05:55.942 --> 00:05:57.800
or it's strange,
it's like the old saying, you know,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.832
you don't know how much you
miss something until it's gone.

00:05:59.832 --> 00:06:02.872
And when you're in the office every day
around tons of people and maybe you have

00:06:02.872 --> 00:06:06.141
too many meetings, you're like, gosh, I
wish I didn't have to meet all the time,

00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:09.090
whereas when I'm remote, I feel like I
look forward to the meetings because

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.200
that's my opportunity to actually get
to talk to somebody during the day.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Absolutely.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.390
So do you have any final thoughts for
our students who might be trying to

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.410
solve the problem of student isolation
when they're designing their tools?

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.520
&gt;&gt; I think it's just to be conscientious
of the things we just talked about, and

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.188
to recognize that, you know,
maybe when your motivation is down and

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:31.874
you feel isolated, to go out and
seek and speak with other students.

00:06:31.874 --> 00:06:33.369
You never know what
you're going to learn.

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:38.155
And I think there's a lot of
reciprocity between what happens

00:06:38.155 --> 00:06:40.790
in student conversations a lot.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.496
I mean, you're going to get
something out of it and

00:06:42.496 --> 00:06:45.350
somebody that you're speaking with
is going to get something out of it.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.502
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Makes a lot of sense to me.

00:06:46.502 --> 00:06:47.292
Great.

00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:48.600
Thank you so much for
talking to us today.
