So my name is Gabe Savo, I work at Victor, a sub user data scientist. And I

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.960
actually come from a background that's, that's more towards

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.480
natural sense, sciences. I did statistical physics, I have

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.300
a PhD in statistical physics. And anything that goes

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.270
with that, obviously, I was looking at like a

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.490
lot of big, big systems that that kind of.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.520
Emerge as an interaction of, of very small very

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.810
small entities composing of these systems. And

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.546
and later on I, I did complex network

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:36.950
research. So that means that we have interactions

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.100
again. As in this, in this, imagine like

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.400
a big gas composed of molecules. But

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.920
instead here we have like, the humans interacting

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.220
with, with each other through social networks. Through

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.560
mobile communication networks. So that was the main

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.970
focus of my research all year.
