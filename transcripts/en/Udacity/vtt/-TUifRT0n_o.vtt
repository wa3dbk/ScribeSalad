00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.625
The goal of this line is to invoke the Car function such that

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:07.320
it's parameter this, is bound to the Van instance and

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.610
to do that, we are also going to have to use the keyword, this,

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.690
inside the Van function since it's bound to the right object in there.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.500
At the heart of this confusion is the fact that

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.660
there are two different parameters.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.090
In two different scopes, both of which are given the name this.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.845
But we must keep in mind that the parameter this behaves just like

00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:29.530
other positional parameters to functions.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.790
For example, it's probably not confusing that the loc variable from

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.980
inside Van is being passed along as the first argument to Car,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.730
where it's coincidentally given the same name.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.360
Even though the two variables share the same name.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.620
We think of them as different, because they're in different scopes.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.050
The shared name is incidental and

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.890
this line merely passes along the binding from one function to another.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.460
The same is true of the parameter this.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.310
It's just being passed in a bit different way.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.390
To underscore this point let's consider a snippet from a totally

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.260
separate math library.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.910
The double function calls the product function passing along its

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.760
x variable to the product function wherein it's going to be given the name a.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.880
That example is uncontroversial but

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.870
what if we were to use the same argument name in both functions.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.490
How would you expect that to effect how our code runs.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.440
In fact, there's no change to how these two functions would behave.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.750
The new example would seem almost as uncontroversial as the previous one.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.350
Even though both functions have an input named num,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.720
it's clear that those names are coincidental.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.220
The code behaves the same as if they were actually named differently.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.940
Since the two variables are in different scopes.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.490
Interestingly, the situation is almost exactly the same when we

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.120
pass along the value 3 to be bound to the parameter this.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.710
If we use the same binding to the parameter this in our above function call,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.090
we have ourselves the same situation.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.500
Where two different parameters, in two different scopes, happen to

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.370
share a name and again, we're just invoking the function a little differently so

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.389
that we're allowed to bind the value to the parameter this.
