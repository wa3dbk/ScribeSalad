00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
Now, the important thing to notice here is that clique is a maximization problem.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.310
That is, we're trying to find a clique that is as large as possible.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.680
So we have already found a clique with 100 vertices.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.370
So an optimum solution has to contain at least 100 vertices,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.410
because we already know that a clique of this size is contained in the input network.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.570
So this time, this 1 over here is easy.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.500
Now, what about the maximum number of vertices in an optimum solution?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.580
There could be a clique that is bigger than 100 vertices, but we just haven't found it.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.810
Well, since clique is a maximization problem, we have to plug it into this equation here.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.540
So our solution was 100 vertices which is ≥ 1/C.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.240
C is the approximation factor, 1/C x the optimum, and if we solve that equation,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.320
we find out that the optimum solution contains ≤ 200 vertices.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.450
So this gives you a good intuition: For a minimization problem,

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.520
a factor-2 approximation algorithm means that we could have found a smaller solution,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.790
but it is limited by this factor-2, and for a maximization problem,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.480
we could have found a larger solution, but this is also limited by this factor-2,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.800
or, more precisely, by 1 over this factor of 2.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.470
So the factor here kind of gives us a range that tells us,

00:01:11.470 --> 99:59:59.000
in a worst case scenario, how far away we are from the optimum solution.
