00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:04.571
So I had a company that made
basically custom audio D.S.P. for

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:09.476
musical applications and I sold that and
I was kind of semi retired and

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:14.228
I was messing around with iOS apps
that were again audio oriented.

00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:17.952
And I met Oliver who's the V.P. end here
and he was working on apps as well and

00:00:17.952 --> 00:00:21.469
he came out here to Silicon Valley and
started a company called Origami.

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:25.287
And I've been kind of out of the game
for a while and was interested and so he

00:00:25.287 --> 00:00:29.228
hired me into that startup and I moved
my family out here to Silicon Valley and

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:33.231
then that startup got acquired by Nest
and then this got acquired by Google and

00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:36.123
I left Google about a year ago
to come here to Utah City and

00:00:36.123 --> 00:00:37.750
head up the engineering team.
