00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.241
We can factor a 2x from the first two terms and a positive 5 from the second two

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:10.338
terms. We can see that this first term and the second term have a common factor

00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:15.171
of 3x plus 2. We factor that out leaving us with 2x plus 5 times the quantity 3x

00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:18.067
plus 2. So here's our factored expression.
