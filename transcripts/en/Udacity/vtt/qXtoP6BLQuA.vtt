If you made it to the end of this
session with your brain intact,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.180
then you have done extremely well.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.390
Closures are a hard concept to grasp.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.830
But once you know what they are and

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.505
how you can use them,
you can really do some powerful things.

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:15.090
We'll see some more examples of this
soon when we talk about Swift's built in

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.280
higher order functions.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.670
See you in the next session.
