00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.319
For this equation, the center is at O,O the a value is 10 since we moved 10

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.442
units in the x direction, left and right. And the b value is 5 since we moved

00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:15.724
vertically from the center 5 units up and 5 units down. Now if you're stumped

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:19.196
about what to do first, remember that we want this to equal one, so we should

00:00:19.196 --> 00:00:25.456
divide our equation through by 400. So, we'll take our equation and divide each

00:00:25.456 --> 00:00:31.520
term by 400 4 divides into 4, leaving us with 1X squared in the numerator. And

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.611
4 divides into 400, leaving 100 in the denominator. For the second term, 16

00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:45.076
divides into 16 one time, and 16 divides into 400 25 times. So, we'll have 1Y

00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:50.258
squared, divided by 25. And finally, on the other side of the equals sign,

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:55.130
we'll have one, since 400 divided by 400 equals one. Now we're looking at an

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.900
equation that fits our general form when the ellipse is centered at the origin.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.239
The center is 0, 0, since there's nothing next to the x and nothing next to the

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.174
y. We simply just have x squared and y squared. Now, the a value is the square

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:16.396
root of this number. So, the a value must be 10. And the b value is the square

00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:21.960
root of this number. So b must be positive 5. If it helps you, you can rewrite

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.867
the denominators as perfect squares. This easily let's you find the a value and

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:31.018
the b value. So, we took this equation, and we changed it to look like

00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:37.363
something else. We've changed the equation to look like this. Let's graph this

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:41.255
one to make sure they're identical. So, so far we have our old blue ellipse

00:01:41.255 --> 00:01:46.562
just like from before that represents this first equation. And you can see that

00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:51.353
I'm on it since it's become bold, since I've clicked on it. Now if I take our

00:01:51.353 --> 00:01:56.355
equation and I set it equal to 1, we have the same exact ellipse. We moved 10

00:01:56.355 --> 00:02:00.555
units in the x direction, left and right, and 5 units in the vertical

00:02:00.555 --> 00:02:06.740
direction, up and down. And we can even write the equation in this form with

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.334
100 as 10 squared and 25 as 5 squared. And if I set this equal to 1, I get the

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:16.976
exact same elipse. These three equations are written in different forms, but

00:02:16.976 --> 00:02:18.710
they're all equivalent.
