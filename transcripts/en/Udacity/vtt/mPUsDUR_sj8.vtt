00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.840
Okay, I'm going to throw some
terms at you, get ready.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.680
You can describe a tree
in terms of levels, or

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.879
how many connections it takes
to reach the root plus one.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.570
The root is level 1, and nodes directly
connected to it are on level 2.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.640
Nodes in a tree are often described as
having a parent child relationship.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.480
In this system,
a node at a lower level is a parent, and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.350
the node connected to it at
a higher level is a child.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.830
A node in the middle can
be both a parent and

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.390
a child,
it depends what it's being compared to.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.180
Keep in mind though this isn't a real
family tree where children all have two

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.300
parents.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.559
Here, children are only
allowed to have one parent.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.170
If a parent has multiple children,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.750
those children are considered
siblings of each other.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.800
You can talk about
ancestry in a similar way.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.140
A node at a lower level
can be called an ancestor

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.480
of a node at a higher level
which is the descendant.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.589
The nodes at the end that don't have
any children are called leaves or

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.360
external nodes.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.330
A parent node is called
an internal node.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.500
You can call connections edges, and

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.820
a group of connections
taken together as a path.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.490
The height of a node is the number
of edges between it and

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.949
the furthest leaf on the tree.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.350
A leaf has a height of zero but the
parent of a leaf has a height of one.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.289
The height of a tree overall is
just the height of the root node.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.990
On the flip side, the depth of a node
is the number of edges to the root.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.860
Height and depth should move inversely.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.700
If a node is closer to a leaf
then it's further from the root.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.967
[SOUND] Glad that's over with.

00:01:39.968 --> 00:01:42.400
Time to learn some more about trees.
