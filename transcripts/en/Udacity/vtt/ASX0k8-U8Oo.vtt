00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.514
So if for example, Grant earns $27,000 total, what is the total amount he's

00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:10.172
going to have to pay in taxes? First figure out how much of his income falls

00:00:10.172 --> 00:00:14.130
within each of these tax brackets. Then, I have listed the tax rate for each of

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.986
those brackets over in this left-hand column. So to figure out how much he's

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:22.672
going to pay in taxes from each of those brackets. Just multiply the income

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:27.366
that falls within that bracket by the rate of that bracket. Once you have all

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.660
of the taxes from each of the brackets, add all of them up to come up with the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.408
total amount of tax Grant's going to have to pay. I'll write in a dollar sign

00:00:35.408 --> 00:00:37.787
for you right here, and you don't have to write them in any of these slots at

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.669
all. Just write the numbers.
