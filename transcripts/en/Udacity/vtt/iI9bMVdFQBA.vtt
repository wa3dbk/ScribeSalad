So what's the significance of the five traits that personality test assessed?

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.648
Well, these are the widely agreed upon core personality traits that

00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:13.968
psychologists believe make up your personality. These are called the big five.

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:19.546
We have openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.679
And neuroticism. Do you remember from the memory lesson when we talked about

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.959
mnemonic devices and how they can help you remember things. Well we have one

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:31.706
for the big five. And that's OCEAN, or you could use CANOE, if you're so

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:36.722
inclined. But what do these traits mean? Let's go to Greg to talk about each

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:38.199
one individually.
