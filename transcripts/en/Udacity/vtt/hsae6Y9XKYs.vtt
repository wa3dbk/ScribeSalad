00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.124
The square quantity is isolated on one side of our equation. So, we can take

00:00:04.124 --> 00:00:08.586
the square root of this side and this side. The square root undoes the square,

00:00:08.586 --> 00:00:11.880
leaving us with m plus 2 on the left, and positive or negative root 36 on the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.948
right. We know the square root of 36 is just 6. So we have this equation next.

00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:22.584
We subtract 2 from both sides, to get m is equal to negative 2, plus or minus

00:00:22.584 --> 00:00:28.014
6. When we have this equation, m equals negative 2, plus or minus 6, we really

00:00:28.014 --> 00:00:33.920
have 2 equations. M could equal negative 2 plus 6, or m could equal negative 2

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.216
minus 6. There's really 2 values of m here. And since these are like terms, we

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:46.210
can simplify. So m could equal positive 4 or m could equal negative 8. These

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.183
were the two solutions.
