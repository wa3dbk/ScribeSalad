00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now I should argue this 1.96 trick isn't mathematically correct for very small sample sizes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It usually assumes we have a least 30 samples, but let's just ignore this for a second.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What you've done is for the coin flip example,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you've actually computed confidence intervals yourself.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's a nontrivial thing to do, and because we like this so much, let's assume that we have a

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
sample size of a 100 and give me all of those numbers over here.
