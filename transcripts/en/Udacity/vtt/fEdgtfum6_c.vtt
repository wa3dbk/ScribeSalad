00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.940
The quickest scene to render is the one without any lighting at all, right here

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.939
on the lower right-hand corner. These objects just use a solid color and so

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.220
little detail is visible. The second fastest to render is here in the upper

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.632
left, as the objects do not cast any shadows. Note how details get lost near the

00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:20.441
front edges. It's hard to tell where the floor ends, and the top of the outer

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:24.450
wall begins. The next fastest to render is here in the lower left. This one has

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.956
shadows, which take longer to render. Shadows help us a bit in telling how

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:31.954
surfaces are related to each other. However, everything in shadow looks the

00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:35.926
same. Since we're computing only light that directly hits these surfaces. The

00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:39.966
slowest rendering is here in the upper right. It's also the highest quality, as

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:43.872
light bounces off the walls and into the shadowed areas, so giving them some

00:00:43.872 --> 00:00:44.643
definition.
