00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.800
Now, let's put everything together. Let's use last.fm's geo.gettopartists

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.164
API call to write a short program to find the

00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:11.830
top-performing artist in Spain. Here's a hint, on the

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.810
page here it shows that we have to pass in

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.900
the country parameter. Also, you may want to use

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.000
the JSON library so it will be easier for you

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.080
to read the JSON data. If you need to register

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.450
for your own API key, you can do so here.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.230
Your code should go into this space.
