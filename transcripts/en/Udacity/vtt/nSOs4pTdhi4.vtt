00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.288
In this last section on language and thought, we're going to discuss judgement

00:00:04.288 --> 00:00:09.264
and decision making. For example, when I was at home writing this lesson I kept

00:00:09.264 --> 00:00:13.870
wonderign all day, should I eat that burrito that's in the refridgerator. Now

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.442
you may say, well that's a silly question. But not really if you think that the

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:21.797
way I answer it could have a profound effect on my health and weight. For

00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:24.688
example, if I ate a burrito every day and didn't exercise, that could be

00:00:24.688 --> 00:00:29.228
trouble for me. Every day we're faced with these types of situations and

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:34.050
questions. For example, are you going to go to that rock concert? What are you

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.792
going to wear today? Are you going to call that person back? So, in this

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:41.614
lesson, we'll learn about how we do make those judgments, and our decisions.
