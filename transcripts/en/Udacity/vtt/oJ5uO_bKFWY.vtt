00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.236
Our three inequalities describing these three intervals, are x is less than

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:08.720
negative 4, which is over here, the region to the left of negative 4. Negative 4

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.264
is less than x which is less than 4, which is this interval in the middle. And

00:00:13.264 --> 00:00:16.937
lastly on the far right of our number line, x is greater than 4.
