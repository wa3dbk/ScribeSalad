00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.660
OK, so here we have our data. And from cell A1, if we push Cmd down, or on a PC

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.103
I believe it's Ctrl down, then we see that there are 8,702 students. So first

00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:22.762
let's calculate the average. So again, equals. Average, cell a1 colon a8,702,

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:31.130
enter. So we get that the engagement ratio is about 0.077, if we round to the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.579
nearest thousandth. Okay, now that we have the mean, let's figure out the

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.488
standard deviation. And we don't use a correction when we're treating this a

00:00:41.488 --> 00:00:51.372
population. So first let's find the square deviations from the mean. Equals a1

00:00:51.372 --> 00:01:01.117
minus $d$1. To keep this mean constant. Because otherwise if we just put D1 and

00:01:01.117 --> 00:01:07.984
then we copied this cell for all of column B then it would subtract D2 from A2,

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:14.222
and then D3 from A3, and there's nothing there. We want to always subtract D1

00:01:14.222 --> 00:01:21.059
and then we'll square this quantity. So there's are first square deviation.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:33.625
We'll copy this, Cmd+C or Ctrl+C. We'll go to cell A8702, go to B8702, Cmd shift

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:42.140
up arrow key. All of column B is highlighted. Cmd+v. Now we have all our squared

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.176
deviations. Now let's take the average square deviation, which is the variance.

00:01:48.177 --> 00:02:01.999
Equals average B1 colon B8702. So here's what we get for variance. And now for

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:10.960
standard deviation we'll take the square root. Equals sqrt D2. So if we round

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.880
the standard deviation to the nearest thousandth, we get 0.107.
