00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.100
These frameworks typically all provide late binding,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.080
persistence, encapsulation and sub-typing.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.700
They provide support for communication among components including events,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.030
channels and uniform data transfer mechanisms.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.130
They also offer some form of component transfer packaging,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.170
such as JavaJar files, ComCab files, or CLI assemblies.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.960
They all provide a way of describing deployments such as via configuration file.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.850
This description is also typically available at runtime via mechanisms such as

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.670
Reflection or metadata.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.030
Any given framework provides a way of serving,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.182
of serving components such as an application server model like EJB,

00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:46.079
COM+ and CCM or web server models like JSP and ASP.Net.
