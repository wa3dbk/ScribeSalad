00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We have already covered the lowest harvest rate of 2.0 * 10⁵ tons per year,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and we saw that we have a problem with over fishing if we are below this equilibrium point.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If we are above that equilibrium point, the amount of fish will not decrease to zero.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For the lower value, it depends. Namely, it depends on the initial amount of fish.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The upper harvest rate clearly amounts to over fishing independent of the initial amount of fish.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The loss is always larger than the gain.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In this case, we surely have the situation that the amount of fish decreases to zero.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If we use this harvest rate that just touches the peak of our gain graph,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
things get a little tricky.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If we start with an amount of fish that's below 1 million tons, we lose more than we gain per time,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
which means that the amount of fish is going to become zero eventually

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If we are in the region above 1million tons also the loss is larger than the gain

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
so we are moving towards lower amounts,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but in principle, we would be stopping at this equilibrium point where the loss equals the gain.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is what would be called semi-stable equilibrium.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
On the one side, it is unstable and on the other side it's stable,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
but imagine what happens if we have eventually reached this equilibrium from the other side,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
just a tiny disturbance would suffice to make you drop down to the left end of that graph.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Almost surely the amount of fish will decrease to zero if we pick the rate of 2.5*10⁵ tons per year.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And this rate is called the maximum sustainable yield.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In theory, you could be harvesting at this rate forever and ever,

00:01:54.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but of course, that's pretty dangerous whenever there's this largest disturbance.
