00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.885
Okay, let's look at these.

00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:03.551
So here I've drawn a chunk of memory.

00:00:03.551 --> 00:00:05.649
And we're going to say that g points into this memory.

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.186
So this is g sub 0, g sub 1, g sub 2, and so forth.

00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:11.821
And here's a bunch of threads, and we're just going to reason out

00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:14.870
where each of these threads is accessing in memory.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.333
So in the first case, g sub i equals a.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:23.930
Well every thread is simply accessing allocation and memory defined by its thread index.

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:26.372
This is exactly the example we've been talking about.

00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:30.136
A given set of threads will be accessing a bunch of adjacent

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:33.773
contiguous locations in memory, so this case is clearly coalesced.

00:00:33.773 --> 00:00:38.447
In this case, every thread is accessing a location in memory defined by its index times 2.

00:00:38.447 --> 00:00:41.359
So there's going to be a strided access here, right?

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:45.240
Threads are going to end up reading every other location in memory.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.785
So, this is the access pattern we've called strided, it's not coalesced.

00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:54.866
This next access pattern is exactly like the first time, except that we're doing reads instead of writes.

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:59.504
So again, every thread is simply reading a location defined by it's own index in memory.

00:00:59.504 --> 00:01:03.678
Therefore, adjacent threads will access adjacent locations in memory, and just

00:01:03.678 --> 00:01:06.980
like the first example, we're going to have a nice coalesced access pattern.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.846
This next example is coalesced because every thread is reading from a location

00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:19.613
defined by g plus some offset block width over 2 plus the thread's index.

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:28.923
So if this is block width number 2, then every thread will be accessing adjacent locations starting at that offset.

00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:33.466
So this is coalesced. And this example is simply the same pattern.

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:38.492
We're going to read from this location which is defined by an offset plus the thread index.

00:01:38.492 --> 00:01:40.363
We're going to multiply it times a constant.

00:01:40.363 --> 00:01:45.186
And we're going to store the result back into a contiguous, chunk of memory.

00:01:45.186 --> 00:01:48.724
So this is simply a coalesced read followed by a coalesced write.

00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:54.970
Therefore, the statement is coalesced. And finally, this example is a little different.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.766
Here we're going to be accessing a location, offset of memory minus the thread index.

00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:06.394
So thread 0 will access block width over 2, thread 1 will access block

00:02:06.394 --> 00:02:11.921
width over 2 minus 1, thread 2 will access block width over 2 minus 2, and so forth.

00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:14.699
And as you can see, even though we're doing the subtraction

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.519
here instead of an addition, we're still accessing a contiguous region in memory.

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.561
Every thread is accessing adjacent locations and contiguous chunk of

00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:24.893
memory, so this is still coalesced.
