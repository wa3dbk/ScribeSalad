00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.900
You've just learned how to write some very simple programs and how to correct

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.060
errors and to deal with all sorts of fussy details. Let's step back a little

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.440
bit and think about what a computer can do for us. A computer can execute an

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.710
algorithm. That's a technical term for a recipe of instructions that are

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.990
unambiguous, executable, and terminating. Well, those are big words. So let's

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.830
see what's going on. Unambiugous means that the recipe can be interpreted in

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.220
only one way. Executable means that its steps are those that a computer can

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.480
actually carry out. And terminating, of course, means that they come to an end.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.270
That's all pretty abstract. Let's look at a concrete situation. You need to buy

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.340
a car. You have two choices: this beauty over here, it's cheap, but it has

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.610
terrible gas mileage, or this sleek one over here, expensive, but great

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.830
mileage. Which is the better buy? I'll show you an algorithm that makes that

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:05.040
decision. The first car costs $15,000. And the second car costs $30,000. So, it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.130
looks like we should buy the first car. But, not so fast. The first car gets 10

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.676
miles per gallon, and the second car 50 miles per gallon. So, what do you

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:19.260
think? Which car should I buy? Do you think I should go for Car 1 or for Car 2?

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.040
Or, in the end doesn't it really matter? Or maybe you don't have enough

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.800
information to give an exact answer. Tell me what you think.
