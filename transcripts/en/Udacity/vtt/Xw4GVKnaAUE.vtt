00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.949
So now that we've defined out type, we want to create some objects of that type.

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:07.590
And the way to that is to use the class name followed by a parameter list. This

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.130
could be empty, but you still need the parens. This is just like when we call a

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.574
function. So, for the restaurant type, we don't need any parameters. So, we'll

00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:18.642
create a restaurant object, just like this. This is just like any other object

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:22.322
in Python, we can assign it to a variable. If we're doing this outside the

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:26.487
restaurant module, we need to import. So, what we'll do on our code is use the

00:00:26.487 --> 00:00:30.627
from to import from the restaurant module, and we only need to import one

00:00:30.627 --> 00:00:34.852
definition, it's the definition of the class restaurant. So, let's try a few

00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:37.890
things in the Python interpretor. So, we'll create a new instance of the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.806
restaurant type. And we can see that it has a type. It's type is a class named

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:50.662
Restaurant, that's the type we just defined. Suppose we create another one, so

00:00:50.662 --> 00:00:55.108
now have two instances of the restaurant type. They both have the same type, but

00:00:55.108 --> 00:00:59.332
are they the same object? If you guessed before I showed you the result. And the

00:00:59.332 --> 00:01:02.960
result is False, they're not the same object. They're two different objects.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.578
Another way to see this is to look at their hash. Hash is a built in operator in

00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:12.876
Python that maps each object to unique identity. Here, McDowell's has this

00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:18.842
fairly minimalist number, you'll get a different number if you try yourself. And

00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:21.710
the hash of Chez Bananas is different.
