00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.250
So far, we've addressed the first
of the remaining questions we had

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.520
about the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.200
Now we turn to the second question
regarding its running time.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.950
Recall that the only
bound that we have so

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.830
far on the number of iterations,
is the value of the flow itself,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.480
since each iteration must increase the
value of the flow that we find by one.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.510
Let's see if this bound is tight.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.620
Consider the flow network below, and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.710
give the maximum number of augmenting
paths that Ford-Fulkerson might find.
