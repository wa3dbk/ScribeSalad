00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.110
At this point, I'm going to set you free. The lessons for the rest of this unit

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.012
will be showing a number of demos related to more advanced effects. Most of

00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:10.206
them have code samples you can look at and see what makes them tick. Rather

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:12.789
than me describing the five things you need to do to enable textures and hook

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.609
them up, just look at the code and documentation. 3JS makes many of these

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.778
effects surprisingly easy to use right out of the box. Be assured that there

00:00:20.778 --> 00:00:23.722
will still be some exercises in the problem set to get you applying some basic

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:27.708
textures to surfaces. However, the effects on the lessons ahead are such that

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:30.652
I'd feel a bit guilty making you connect some bits of code together just to see

00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:34.906
the syntax. This is where the roller coaster really starts to go wild and the

00:00:34.906 --> 00:00:37.300
best way for you to learn is to rip into the code yourself and see how it

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.930
works.
