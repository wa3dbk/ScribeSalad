00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.480
One of the best things about doing the critical memory path analysis is you

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.810
can get a pretty good estimate for how long the page will take to render.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty awesome. Once I have

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.770
my critical rendering path diagram I don't even

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.330
have to profile my page. Well, I do

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.860
need to profile my page for other bottlenecks, but

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.610
what I mean is that I can see all the dependencies in my critical rendering path

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.620
diagram and get a good idea of how long my page is going to take to render.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.810
&gt;&gt; Exactly. With a little bit of practice you

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.730
can just take a look at the XML and figure out what the critical

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.100
rendering path is. And you know what,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.770
that's actually a great exercise. I'm going to

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.360
give you a couple of files which you can find in the instructor notes, and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.450
why don't you analyze those, draw the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.890
diagrams, and come up with the CRP metrics.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.160
&gt;&gt; So should I draw a diagram like the ones we've been seeing in the examples?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.250
&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly. And don't worry about making it pretty. Use whatever tools

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.350
you like. Pen and paper is good, and then post it on the forum.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.540
&gt;&gt; Alright, so I'll make sure I've

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.950
got the three critical rendering path metrics too.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.850
The critical path length the number of

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.820
critical resources, and the number of critical bytes.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.110
&gt;&gt; Yep. Exactly.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.890
&gt;&gt; Cool, so I'll go ahead and post it on the forums.
