00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.630
For this exercise, we want you to try

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.130
to fix the problem with a home heating system.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.730
Design a system that conveys the proper conceptual model.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.860
See, existing home heating systems make it really difficult,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.239
or impossible, to determine the proper conceptual model

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.420
for it's operation. The designers didn't seem to consider

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.091
this important. They didn't provide an accurate system image.

00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:25.872
So, fix it. Show how you would design heating

00:00:25.872 --> 00:00:29.350
system that provided the proper user model, conveying

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.680
the correct conceptual model, so people would never

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.344
again set their thermostats too high or too

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:38.050
low, in an effort to speed up the process.
