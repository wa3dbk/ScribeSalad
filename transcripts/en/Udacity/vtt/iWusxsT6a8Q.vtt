00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.586
If we had a binomial or trinomial in these denominators, we would want to factor

00:00:04.586 --> 00:00:08.635
them first. But since these are monomials, we can use our factor tree method to

00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:13.463
figure out what they share. I know 9 and 15 share a common factor of 3, and the

00:00:13.463 --> 00:00:18.025
a's share a common factor of 1a. The highest power of b that's in common is b

00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:23.053
squared. So 3ab squared is my greatest common factor. The other factor for this

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:27.270
denominator is 3a squared. If we multiply these two together, we'll get our

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.439
original denominator. Whereas for this fraction, the missing factor is 5b

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.200
squared, if I multiply these two together we'll get 15, 3 times 5, a, and then b

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.065
squared times b squared or b to the fourth. We multiply all these factors

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:48.662
together to get our LCD. So our lowest common denominator is 3 times 3 times 5,

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:53.642
which is 45 and then a squared time a which is a cubed, and b squared times b

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:58.091
squared which b to the fourth. I said earlier that you want to use the highest

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:02.640
power of any factor for the lowest common denominator. Notice that we have a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.668
cubed in a. A cubed is the highest power in either denominator. So we want to

00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:12.316
make sure that appears in our LCD. Likewise between b squared and b to the

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:16.988
fourth, this fourth power is higher, so we know b to the fourth needs to appear

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:21.138
in our LCD. This is a quick way you can check to make sure your variables or

00:01:21.138 --> 00:01:22.683
your factors are correct.
