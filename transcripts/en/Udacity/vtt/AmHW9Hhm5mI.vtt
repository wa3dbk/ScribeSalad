00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.410
Designing a responsive site,
uses the same concepts and

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.640
processes that you go through for
a non responsive site.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.120
Except instead of drawing
a single wide design,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.700
there are a few more to accommodate
different screen sizes.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.220
I like to start my design with the
smallest form factor, usually a phone.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.370
Once that one's complete,
I move up to the next.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.640
And as each design is completed,
I ask myself, is there a need for

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.240
a design for a wider screen?

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.830
At some point, there's really
no need for a bigger design.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.710
By starting small I really have to
prioritize what's important for

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.900
my users.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.710
What's the most important
thing that they want to do, or

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.110
that they're going to see on screen?

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.920
When starting big and
then designing down.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.390
It can be too easy to just cut or
hide content that may be important.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.300
Instead, by prioritizing content and

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.390
working up, the key content
is always on the page and

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.400
users get the full experience,
no matter what device they're using.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.550
The design for one hardware store
prioritizes information about

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.640
the nearest store,
it's address, hours, and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.210
phone number and puts those right at
the top so I can find them easily.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.100
Beyond designing from small to large,
I also code from small to large.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.520
This way, I know that my course styles,
and layout will work for

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.530
any device, even on legacy browsers
that don't support media queries.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.245
But probably my favorite reason to start
from small and work up is performance.

00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:34.005
By designing for
the smallest viewport first,

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:37.515
I'm forced to think about
performance from the beginning.

00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:41.605
I have to make a conscious decision
about prioritizing content, and

00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:43.425
how much data I'm sending to the user.
