00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.240
The new tools we learned in
this session, loops, arrays,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.900
hashes, are some of the most important
concepts in all of programing.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.305
We'll continue to build upon
them as this course progresses.

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:18.021
Everything we've done so far has been
with relatively simplistic data,

00:00:18.021 --> 00:00:21.227
an array of names,
a hash representing a person.

00:00:21.227 --> 00:00:24.841
Those types of examples are important,
when you're starting out, but

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:26.630
they may seem a little bit trivial.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.960
It's time for us to step it up.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.710
In this session,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.190
you're going to build a project
using more complex, realistic data.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.960
Imagine, that we run an online retailer,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.620
Toy City, that sells the best
toys in all the world.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.999
You love your job, except for one thing.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.750
Things are not going well for Toy City.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.470
Children actually hate
toys now with a passion.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.280
To help turn the business around,
our boss has

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.620
asked us to write an application that
will analyze our product sales data and

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.840
generate a nice looking sales report.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.410
Here's a preview of the crazy product
sales data we'll be working with.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.000
We'll revisit this project and continue
to improve it in future sessions.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.900
In this first iteration, we're going to
focus on running some simple analysis

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.700
on the data and printing
a simple report to the terminal.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.110
In future iterations,
we'll save the output to a text file and

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.140
incorporate an API.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.140
This project is a big step up,
but don't worry.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.030
We'll be here to help you along the way.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.960
Let's go ahead and take a closer look at
the project specifications and setup.
