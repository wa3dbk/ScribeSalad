00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.260
So how would scripts help inform the design of an agent to solve Raven's

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.090
progressive matrices? Remember,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.060
scripts are ways of making sense of complex events in the world and

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.390
we can certainly consider individual Raven's matrices to be complex situations.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.309
You thus might have a script for different broad categories of Raven's problems.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.230
If this was your approach, what would your entry conditions be for each script?

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.070
What would the tracks be? What would the scenes be? Where are these scripts

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.670
going to come from? Are you going to tell the agent what script it should use or

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.710
will it learn a script from prior problems? If the agent succeeds using

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.480
the script that you give it, who is intelligent? You or your agent?
