00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.700
Now, let's say we have a random sample of ten people who each told us how

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.260
many hours they slept the night before and

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.860
their temporal memory score on the BBC test. Is

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.690
there a relationship between these two variables? Well,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.870
it's very difficult to judge relationships based on

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.450
just lists of data. So let's visualize it.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.800
This scatter plot visualizes the data in the table.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.410
Each point represents one row of the table.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.940
Here you can see that the hours slept

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.190
was about five and the temporal memory score

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.084
looked to be about 55. That must correspond

00:00:39.084 --> 00:00:44.706
to this row here, 556. You can see that hours slept is on the X axis and

00:00:44.706 --> 00:00:52.050
temporal memory score is on the Y axis. We call the variable on the X axis

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.840
the independent variable or the predictor variable. And we call the variable on

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.970
the Y axis the dependent variable, or

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.230
the outcome. We're trying to predict temporal

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.780
memory score, using hours slept. Now that

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.740
you've sen this data visualized, what can

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.130
we say about the relationship between hours

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.540
slept and temporal memory score? This time

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.460
this question might be easier to answer.
