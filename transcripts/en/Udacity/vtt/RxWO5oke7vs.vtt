00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.539
We haven't really used graphs to help us solve inequalities but it is possible.

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:09.169
Thinking about how we could graphically solve equations which of these graphs do

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.456
you think will help us show the inequality x squared is greater than 16. And

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:17.810
which one do you think will help us show x squared minus 16 is greater than 0?

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.692
Fill in either a or b in each box.
