00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
The answer is that up here there's 8 different possibilities and down here, there's 16 possibilities.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.640
Now, there's two ways to go about this.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.560
One is to just do the counting, which can get very tedious at least in the graph down here,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.280
or the other one is to figure out a general rule which could be quite helpful and that rule is that

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.260
any time that you want to move forward you have two different choices that you can make.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.650
Once you start in A, there's two different choices. You can go either that way or that way.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.200
If your say in this vertex here, you have two choices.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.910
You can either stay up here or you can go down here.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.080
Likewise when you're down here, you can go either this way or that way.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.750
Each time you move forward, you can make one of two choices and since here,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.120
you can make one of two choices except for the last time.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.400
In the last move, you'll always have to end up at B, so here we have 1, 2, 3 times

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.490
that we can make two choices and then we cannot make a choice here anymore.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.170
And 2³ is 8 and down here, it's basically the same thing.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.160
We just have one more of these layers here where we can

00:01:04.160 --> 99:59:59.000
make a choice and so that's going to be 2⁴ or 16.
