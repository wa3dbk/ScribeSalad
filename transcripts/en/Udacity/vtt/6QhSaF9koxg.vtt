00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.439
So another way that we can understand this is that we start out with a random assignment

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.680
that has a distance of  n/2 to the satisfying assignment

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.500
Again, assuming that assignment exists.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.500
So, by distance, I mean the number of variables we need to flip.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.169
We can expect this to be about n/2 as we just found out.

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:24.850
Each time this algorithm here goes through the loop, there's two things that can happen

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.960
The first thing is that we move closer to the satisfying assignment

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.980
and by closer, I mean that we gained one more variable

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.700
that is set to the same as it would be in the satisfying assignment.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.550
So basically, making a step forward happens with probability one-third

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.260
but of course as we also just found out, we can also make a step backward

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.130
and kind of flip the wrong variable and the probability for doing that is at most two-thirds.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.550
Let's show worse case analysis here so we will erase this one here

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.190
and say in a worse case, we make a step forward with probability exactly one-third

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.970
and we make a step backward with probability exactly two-thirds.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.900
And how often do we make this step? Well, the loop here is executed 3n&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.479
So what happens is the following, we start off here with our random assignment and then 3n

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.830
We either move forward with probability one-third or we move backward with probability two-thirds.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.340
And then the next time assume that we are lucky, we have move forward,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.050
we again move forward with probability one-third and backwards with probability two-thirds

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.920
and this goes on and on and on and on until we either reach the satisfying assignment

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.490
or which is much more likely, we don't reach the satisfying assignment.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.860
We might even get farther away from it.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.470
Actually, chances are pretty good that we are.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.759
Now, the nasty thing here of course is that we move forward

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.150
with the lower probability than moving backward.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.440
So, the probability of coming from a random assignment to the satisfying assignment

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.830
by running the algorithm once actually doesn't seem too good

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.500
and the exact probability analysis here is somewhat complicated

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.960
especially if you haven't had an intermediate course in statistics yet,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.889
but what we can try to do even if the statistic analysis is may be a bit complicated

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.160
is at least do a simulation.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.890
So, run a program to do simulation for me.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.290
Assuming you start at a distance one half from a satisfying assignment

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.790
What's the probability of making n/2 steps in the right direction

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.500
if the probability of making a step in the right direction is one-third

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.230
and the probability of  making a step in the wrong direction is two-thirds

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.860
and you try 3n and then run this for different values of n and here's what I got.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.070
Now, of course, when you run such a simulation yourself, you might get a little bit different results,

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.730
but you will be more or less in the same range, I hope.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.450
Here are the results that I got.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.050
For n equals 10, you end up at 2.8% probability of making n/2 steps in the right direction.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.360
For n equals 20, it's 0.084% and you can see that it rather quickly decreases.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.270
Now, my question to you here, does the probability decrease

00:02:58.270 --> 99:59:59.000
as a function of n again logarithmically with n, linearly with n, or exponentially with n.
