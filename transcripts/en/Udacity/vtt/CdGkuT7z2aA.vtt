00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.440
We saw many of the common software
vulnerabilities or bugs and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.500
how they can be exploited.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.910
We also learned about a number of
defenses, including what we can do and

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.940
also what the operating
system can do for us.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.930
At this point, hopefully, you are well
aware of some of the secure programming

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.120
practices that we should all be using.
