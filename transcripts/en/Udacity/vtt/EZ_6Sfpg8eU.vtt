00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
On the more philosophical level, when delta debugging returns, is not only to simply itself

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but is also to cause for the failure.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What is the cause anyway?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Assume i have a window and here comes a ball flying to the window and the window breaks.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You would think later that the ball is the cause for the window to break.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But why is it the cause? This is so called counterfactual definition of causality

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which is the most used in our context. It works as follows:

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We have two events, and A comes before B.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Say A, is the ball flying towards the window? and B, is the window shattering?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We now say that A causes B, if B had not occurred if A had not occurred.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Applied to our example, we can say that the ball causes the window to shatter

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
if the window had not shatter if the ball has not arrived which actually is true.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
With the ball, the window shatters. Without the ball, the window does not shatter.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And since the ball precede the shattering, everything is in place to say

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that the ball caused the window to shatter.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If this sounds complicated, we haven't seen much.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Causality is one of the most disputed subject in Philosophy.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Some philosophers are even saying that causality does not really exist. It's just an illusion.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
For our purposes; however, that is within debugging,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
this counterfactual definition does a good job.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
First, we have the ball then we have the window crashing forward.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
First, we have the defect and then we have the failure.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So why does delta debugging returned cause?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Simply because there might be a large set of events that all could or could not contribute to the failure.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The sun is shining. The clouds are in the sky. There's a nice tree along.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And what areas that none of this is relevant for shattering the window.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Only the ball by simplifying the scenery towards a single element

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that is responsible for the test to fail, delta debugging returns the cause.
