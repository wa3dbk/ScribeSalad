00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.194
In this case, x must equal negative 4. Great work if you found this number. We

00:00:05.194 --> 00:00:09.730
start by taking our fraction of 1 divided by 81, and we rewrite it as 81 raised

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.390
to the negative first power. Remember that this negative 1 will flip over our

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.664
base. This would make us have our reciprocal of one divided by 81. So we know

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:28.523
these two are equal. Next, we want to make these bases both be 3. So, I rewrite

00:00:28.523 --> 00:00:34.053
81 as 3 to the 4th. We have a power raised to a power, so we can multiply these

00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:39.107
together to get 3 to the negative 4th. Now my bases match so the exponents must

00:00:39.107 --> 00:00:43.713
match as well. x equals negative 4.
