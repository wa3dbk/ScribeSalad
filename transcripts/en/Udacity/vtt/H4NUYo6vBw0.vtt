My name is Brent Beer.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.730
I'm one of the trainers here at GitHub.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.600
Which usually entails sometimes doing online classes.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.520
Classes in person.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.920
Or sometimes, with Enterprise customers doing private courses, as well.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.130
So, one of the things that confuses people, often, when they first start is,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.610
well, I know, I've heard about Git and I've heard about GitHub.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.900
You know? What is the difference between the two?

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.070
And Git, itself, being the version control tool that GitHub is built on.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.080
So, Git is largely the thing that will be interacting with on the laptop.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.070
Doing that local work first and as soon as we use a few choice commands and

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.230
send things up to GitHub that's when it's more the social component or

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.340
it's in it's network, it's in a cloud if you wanted to use that term as well.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.975
So Git is local.

00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:49.660
GitHub is where we share and collaborate with other people.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.920
The reason why I like pull request is because it allows us to, really get

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.940
that work that we're wanting to, kind of, work on, and complete that feature.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.840
And allow us to collaborate with other people just to show them our work.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.700
Get feedback on it.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.790
So that we can have people kind of working with us as they choose to or

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.550
as we want to pull other people into the work itself.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.940
When GitHub started you know, a few years ago kind of a, as a out of a need for

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.630
the Ruby community to have ways to kind of share their code and collaborate.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.890
It's expanded past that and now, you know, a lot more open source communities

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.940
and languages have, you know, grown within GitHub and the GitHub ecosystem.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.350
So, GitHub helped the open source community and, and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.790
helped make it a little bit better by allowing us to have this centralized place

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.240
where we can talk about any features that we're wanting to work on.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.620
Any problems that we might have as we decide to share code around or

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.840
incorporate code into other projects so

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.850
it helps the communities kind of have that place where they can pull together,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.850
talk about their new features and work through problems together.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.490
In fact, the node community itself is one of the larger communities that

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.910
first started out after GitHub was already around.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.030
So, they were able to flourish as a community, whereas other communities maybe

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.010
were older and came to GitHub later and then grew from there.
