00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.030
The grammar of graphics was not created purely for

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.580
logistical reasons though it does have that nice side effect of not having to

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.830
repeat work if specifications change.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.390
By separating the underlying data from the means of presenting that data,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.770
you can think separately about each visual element and the structure and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.280
form of that data.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.190
This allows us to both transform and manipulate our data without having to

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.810
worry about the visual representation and what might get messed up.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.000
And the last great effect I'll go over of separating our

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.090
data from the visual presentation of that data is to allow for

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.580
very interesting collaboration across teams.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.320
Let's say possibly between a designer who works on

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.380
the visual aesthetic separately from developers or

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.340
engineers who might work on transforming and merging data.
