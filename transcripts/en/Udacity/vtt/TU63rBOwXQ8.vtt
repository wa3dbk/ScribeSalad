00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.990
As Moore put it out, correlation can help us decide

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.910
which variables are related. But even correlation coefficients can be deceptive

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.650
if you're not careful. Plotting your data is the best way

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.860
to help you understand it and it can lead you to

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.472
key insights. Let's consider another data set that comes with the

00:00:16.472 --> 00:00:20.410
alr3 package. You'll need to install this package first and then

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.870
make sure you load it. The data set that we're going to

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.680
load is called the Mitchell Data Set. The Mitchell Data Set

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.430
contains soil temperatures from Mitchell, Nebraska.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.210
And they were collected by Kenneth

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.380
G Hubbard from 1976 to 1992. By working with this data set,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.900
we'll see how correlation can be somewhat deceptive. So, for your first

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.560
task, I want you to create a scatter plot of temperature versus months.
