00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The mean is obviously 3, the variance will be 0, and the standard deviation will be 0.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The reason is when you subtract 3 from the sequence you have 0s left.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The squares of those are 0s, the sum of those is 0.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If you then complete the variance, it's 0.

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The square root of that is 0 as well, which means there is no spread at all in the data.
