00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.340
When you need new software,
what do you typically do?

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.780
You might visit an app store
like this and download it or

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.080
you could actually walk into a store and
buy a physical copy.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.560
You have a lot of different options.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.880
You might even say you
have a list of options.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.940
Now how often have you seen software for
Linux sitting up on a store shelf?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.700
Not very often, if at all.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.460
But we still have a list of various
places we can go to get software.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.730
This is called a package source list.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.310
Let's take a look.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.345
All of your available package
sources are listed in this file

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:33.830
/etc/app/sources.list.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.890
Remember when we were
discussing distributions,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.310
we said each one approves and
releases packages in their own way and

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.049
that's one of the big ways
in which they differ.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.200
This is the package's list for
your current version of Ubuntu.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.220
As you skim through the file, you'll
see some pretty recognizable parts.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.720
We see a URL here and
the word trusty looks familiar.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.930
That's the code name for
the version of Ubuntu we're running.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.150
We know Ubuntu is also
based off of Debian, so

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.920
that's probably what this deb stands for
here.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.600
This is a list of software repositories
that Ubuntu set up for us automatically.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.200
There are a lot in this list and
each of these would be referenced

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.140
when you try to update or
install new software.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.610
Speaking of which, let's go ahead and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.530
make sure that all of our
software is up to date.
