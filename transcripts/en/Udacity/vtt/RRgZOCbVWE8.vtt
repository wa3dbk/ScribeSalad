00:00:00.026 --> 00:00:03.321
When we push branch a, Git will start form the tip e53 and

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:07.425
trace back to find all the commits that are reachable from that commit and

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:10.934
send the ones that aren't already on the GitHub repository.

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:14.920
So e53 and fd2 will both be sent.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.830
But 6b4 won't, since it's not reachable from branch a.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.550
And a3b won't, because it's already on the remote repository.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.360
So after the push, the GitHub repository will look like this.
