00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.500
As you've seen, graphs are great for
modelling connections between elements.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.180
That's wonderful on its own, but graphs
are really powerful because they're so

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.360
easy to traverse based on connections.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.128
Graph traversal is a lot
like tree traversal.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.210
Again, a tree is just a specific
type of graph, so that makes sense.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.259
We have two basic methods for traversal.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.801
A depth first search, where we follow
one path as far as it'll go, and

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:33.220
a breadth first search, where we look
at all the nodes adjacent to one

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.860
before moving on to the next level.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.820
These traversals
techniques often show up

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.600
bundled into more advanced
graph algorithms.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.930
So make sure you understand
them before you move on.
