00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.180
Only one of these can be
solved using map, and

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.520
that's adding one to each
element in the input array.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.370
Why can we do that?

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.030
Each individual element in this input
array, is processed in parallel.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.980
We can't sort an input array using
map because the output at any

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.060
position is dependent
on all the input data.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.830
Similarly, to sum up all the elements in
an input array, requires that we look at

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.970
all of the separate elements
to compute a single output.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.110
The individual elements
are not parallel.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.430
Finally to compute the average
of an input array,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.090
also requires this all the one
style of communication.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.280
We don't have in parallel things
that happen independently

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.920
without any communication.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.880
Now, all these other operations are
very, very interesting in GPU computing,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.180
and we will absolutely be covering
them in the next few units.
