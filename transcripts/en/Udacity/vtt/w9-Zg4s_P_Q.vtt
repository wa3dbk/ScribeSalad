00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.480
So you just answer the question of what app

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.200
do you want to build for your final project? In

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.040
this question, you're going to determine in more detail exactly who

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.042
you're building this app for. And in the next question,

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.950
you'll actually can start the high level flow for

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.990
this use, but let's stay focused here. So the flow

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.570
for what you'll do in this question itself. Is first,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.535
you'll find a potential user. This could be a friend,

00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:29.180
co-worker, family member. Somebody who you think could

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.850
ever feasibly want to use the app you described

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.590
here. Then you're actually going to do some very

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.090
basic user-experience research. This will essentially be an interview

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.640
with this person you know. We'll try and

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.380
figure out the attributes about them as they pertain

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.798
to the app you want to build. Now doing

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:51.610
this is really hard, user research is not easy.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.570
And we've provided a privy template which includes some suggested

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.130
questions and categories of questions to think about. Once you've

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.680
done your user research, you'll actually create a persona in

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.730
this case, for the person you interviewed. Again, the template's

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.530
going to be really helpful for this step. Some really key

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.590
points when you're thinking about user research. First, be quiet.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.380
And by that, I mean the other person should be

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.790
doing most of the talking. Try not to interrupt and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.980
definitely don't ever tell them they're wrong. Second, is to ask open questions.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.590
And by this, I mean, let's say you were to make a music app

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.430
for this person. You shouldn't ask a question like: how much do you enjoy

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.580
listening to music in the car? Rather, ask when do you listen to music?
