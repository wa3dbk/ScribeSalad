00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.578
Now that we've covered monomials, let's make this a bit more challenging. Let's

00:00:04.578 --> 00:00:08.734
multiply two binomials. I'm going to start with numbers to give a sense of the

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:13.140
model. Now, even I can't do this that quickly in my head. I actually go about

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.522
this another way. I split up 12 into 10 plus 2. And 14 into 10 plus 4. When I do

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:22.309
2 digit multiplication in my head, I'm actually thinking about a rectangle. The

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:28.134
first factor, or side of my rectangle is 10 and 2. The second factor, or side of

00:00:28.134 --> 00:00:34.026
my rectangle, is 10 plus 4. Now this is pretty easy to visualize and think about

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:40.924
multiplying the numbers together. I would have 100, 40, 20 and 8. To get each of

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:46.548
these areas, I'm simply multiplying the sides of the rectangles. This one is 10,

00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:51.710
and this one is 10, so 100. This rectangle is 2, and this side is 10 because

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.911
this side is 10, so 20. Here, this opposite side is also 10, so I have 10 times

00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:03.531
4, which is 40. And finally, this bottom rectangle is 2 by 4. So I get a total

00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:09.966
of 8. Adding up all of these areas, I get 168. Try multiplying this out and

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:16.763
you'll find it's 168. Pretty amazing. This also makes sense because I have 10

00:01:16.763 --> 00:01:22.281
times 10, which is 100. These 1s are really in the tens spot. Then I have 2

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:27.213
times 10 which is 20. Again, this 1 is in the tens spot. 4 times 10, which is

00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:31.956
40, and 2 times 4, which is 8. These are for the ones spot. I hope this is a new

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:35.278
way to think about multiplication for some of you.
