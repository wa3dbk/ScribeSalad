00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.969
Let's look at the answer for
our way prediction quiz.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:08.760
We can use way prediction in any cache
that has more than one block in a set.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.820
A direct-mapped cache has
only one block in a set.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.498
So we can not use way prediction.

00:00:14.498 --> 00:00:19.115
Basically, a direct-map cache
already knows which one blocked to

00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:21.398
access without having to guess.

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:22.970
In any set-associative, or

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.650
fully associated cache,
we can benefit from way prediction.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.880
For example for
a twoway set-associative cache,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.290
we can guess which on of the two
is more likely to have the block.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.090
In an eight-way set-associative cache,
we're guessing which one of the eight.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.960
And in a fully associative cache,
we are guessing

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.710
which block in the whole cache is
the most likely to have the block.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.560
So the correct answer is,
that these should be selected, and

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.560
this one should not.
