00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.250
So for this menu project, I want to
create an application where I can make

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.470
various restaurant menus with various
items, often within one application.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.600
All restaurant menus in the general
sense contain the same thing.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.860
Some have a few appetizers,
some entrees, a few desserts, and

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.149
of course some beverages.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.570
To keep things simple, let's call
all of these things menu items.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.170
And all of my menu items belong
to a specific restaurant menu.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.260
It also would be helpful
to have a price and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.830
brief description for
each of our menu items.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.760
An important early design decision
to make is how to model my database.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.310
There is more than one correct
way to structure a database, but

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.150
there is no need to make
things too complicated.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.560
Let's walk through the process of
making a database layout together.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.320
We have a restaurant table to represent
all of the restaurants in our database,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.250
along with a corresponding name and
ID number.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.280
Then we have a table of menu items.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.820
Each menu item will have a name,
an ID, a description, a price, and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.150
a course to categorize whether it is an
appetizer, entree, dessert or beverage.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.610
We will also provide a restaurant
ID to assign a foreign key

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.319
relationship with our restaurant table.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.910
Okay.
So

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.120
we've planned out how we
will design our database.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.850
Now let's get to coding it up.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.780
If you've used SQL before you might be
used to writing something like this.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.040
If you're not an SQL expert it might
be a little hard to understand though.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.280
Now there is nothing
wrong with this code, but

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.010
let's take a look at it for a second.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.260
Using raw SQL we have this inquiries
to the database as strings.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.670
This works, but our Python compiler has
no way of helping me if I make a typo or

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670
reference a table that doesn't exist.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.080
Every other data structure we use
in Python is some type of object.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.255
So why not treat our database queries,
tables, and rows as objects as well.

00:01:39.255 --> 00:01:42.905
Well this concern isn't a unique one,
and developers have created tools for

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:43.770
this very problem.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.495
Object-Relational Mappers, or ORM's,
can be thought of like a translator.

00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:51.235
Converting our code from
one form to another.

00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:54.562
If we send off code written in Python or
any other preferred programming

00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:59.802
language, it is transformed by the ORM
into SQL and sent off to our database.

00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:03.182
The ORM also gets results
from an SQL statement and

00:02:03.182 --> 00:02:05.812
allows us to use it as an object
from within our Python code.
