00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.460
So we have this initiation set.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.510
So that's places where it's, let's say,

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.030
legally reasonable to actually execute
this option or this abstract action.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.710
Similarly, we have termination sets.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.801
And a termination set is not the set
of states where an option may be ended,

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:21.349
it's actually a generalization of that.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.345
It's a set of probabilities.

00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:27.829
So, it maps states to a number,
which is the probability that

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.984
the option will end in that state,
or can end that state.

00:00:31.984 --> 00:00:32.577
&gt;&gt; I think that makes it sense.

00:00:32.577 --> 00:00:35.335
So they're both they're
both kind of sets but

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.103
this is kind of a more
soft general kind of set.

00:00:38.103 --> 00:00:40.678
And is it saying that no matter what,

00:00:40.678 --> 00:00:45.829
when the option gets to one of those
termination states a coin is flipped,

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.690
and if it comes up heads
then the option's done?

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.580
&gt;&gt; I think from the point of view of the
person sitting outside the option, yes.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.150
Inside the option it's
not quite done that way.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.980
It's not like the option is running and
it's always flipping a coin.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.120
This is more sort of a a way of
describing the fact that something

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.410
can end in a particular state.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.955
Now, of course, you could turn this
into a set by putting a probability of

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:13.840
0 over all the states,
where you don't want it end and

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.070
having a probability of 1 exactly
where you want it to end.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.640
&gt;&gt; I see, so that's a sense in which
it's a generalization of that idea?

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.110
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.554
But basically, I'm going to execute this
action starting from one of the states

00:01:25.554 --> 00:01:26.102
in set I.

00:01:26.102 --> 00:01:27.850
And it's going to run and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.740
it will in end up in some state
when the option terminates.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.570
And this gives me a probability
of it being in one particular

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.520
state or the other.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.536
So all an action is, is it's,
well you're in a state,

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.760
you take an action and
you end up in another state.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.980
But since we're talking about
these temporally abstract options,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.600
things that happen over time,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.470
we need to know what's happening
inside the option while it's running.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.900
And we already have a term for that.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.190
It's called a policy.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.460
So, here we have a generalization
of the way we've been talking about

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.295
policies in a way.

00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:04.207
Within an option of policy is more than
just a mapping from states to action.

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:10.490
Here, it's a probability of being in
a state and taking a particular action.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.898
But again,
we could turn that into a normal policy,

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:14.760
as we've mostly been talking about it,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.181
by just having a probability of 1 over
the action that we're going to take.

00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:20.991
And 0 zero over everything else.

00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:23.860
And then it is just a direct simple
mapping from state to action.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.030
&gt;&gt; Like a deterministic
Markov memoryless policy?

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.970
&gt;&gt; Thingamajiggy, yes, exactly right.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.530
But, anyway, this is a formalism, but
I think it sort of is just trying to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.260
capture this idea of, as you say, kind
of a procedure or a function that runs.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.351
There are places where you
can execute the function.

00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:44.166
There are states where you'll end up
after you've executed the function.

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:46.029
And there are things that
are happening inside the function.

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:48.895
The code itself is the policy.

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:50.179
It's the actions that you're going to

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:51.680
take in the states that
you're going to see.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.755
&gt;&gt; Hm, okay.

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:54.655
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
let's see what we can do with that.
