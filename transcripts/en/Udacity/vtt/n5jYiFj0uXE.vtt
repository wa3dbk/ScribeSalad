00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.541
Let's do a quick quiz, matching diagrams with the statistical outcome. Let's

00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:10.676
say we have three samples, and here are the statistical outcomes. Put the

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:16.146
statistical outcome by each visual. Some of them might not be used, and some of

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:22.730
them might repeat. So put A, ,B, C or D, one of them in each of these boxes.
