00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.380
We said risk assessment is challenging,
we don't understand all the threats,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.480
we don't know what our vulnerabilities
are of course, so it's two playing two.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.160
Likelihood of a successful attack
of course is going to depend on

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.950
what sort of vulnerabilities you might
have and who's trying to target you.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.809
But we said, well if you can
come up with a probability and

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:23.264
what happens as a result of an attack,
then you can compute the risk,

00:00:23.264 --> 00:00:25.543
that's how you quantify or
assess the risk.

00:00:25.543 --> 00:00:27.802
And you can try to reduce it, but

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:32.250
that's really a question of
managing that, how do we manage?

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.320
What options do we have for

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.340
managing the risk that our business
is exposed to on the cyber front.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.060
So we talked about assessing it, but
if it's too high, then of course,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.260
we'd like to reduce it.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.770
So how do you reduce cyber risk?

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.390
As we said before we get into reduction,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.550
assessing required the likelihood
as well as the impact.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.620
So how do you assess the impact?

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.170
It's the expected loss we're talking
about, so it's expected losses,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.950
really loss multiply the probability,
so we do have get to the loss, and

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.680
when you talk about loss it
could be reputation loss,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.060
target of core suffered
including degrees and sales.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.340
It's the cost of calling somebody in.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.540
So, for example, if you're Sony and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.600
you call FireEye or Mandiant to
come figure out what happened,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.078
I'm sure they paid for that Mandiant or
FireEye got compensated really well.

00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:27.319
Your response, it may be legal costs,
you may have to buy identity theft

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.459
protection for your customers and
things like that.

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:33.450
It's real dollars, reputational.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.600
What you do in the aftermath.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.220
All that has to add up
to sort of the cost or

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.880
the loss that you would
attribute to a certain attack.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.480
And expected I said was that value
multiplied by the probability.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.810
So that's really risk.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.270
Risk was probability times impact,
so maybe the impact is a loss.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.900
So let's just talk about loss here.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.930
So this one would still be talking
about you're assessing risk.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.830
Now let's talk about
how do we manage risk.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.670
So the only three things you can do once
you come up with some sort of a risk

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.830
estimate.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.780
You can say well, I can live with it.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.900
In that case, you're accepting the risk.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.730
You may want to transfer it.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.982
So the risk is transferred
to another party.

00:02:13.982 --> 00:02:17.625
So if something bad happens to you,
the consequences or

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:20.490
the cost is going to be
borne by somebody else.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.840
That somebody else is going to
do it only if they are paid

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.010
to be in that business.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.290
And that business is
the insurance business.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.020
So you can buy insurance.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.800
And by buying insurance, you're
transferring it to whoever insures you.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.200
The other option is you can reduce it.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.500
How do you reduce it?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.580
Well, you're going to reduce it by
deploying new technology solutions, and

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.330
maybe a more expensive,
more effective firewall.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.890
You can reduce by educating your people
or having training and things like that.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.330
More security awareness,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.240
of course, is going to ensure that it's
less likely that they make a mistake, so

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.650
that's going to reduce the likelihood of
the probability of some adverse event.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.360
Which we know a factor,
the way we compute our risks.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.590
So, managing once you have
an estimate of the risk,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.640
there are a couple of options on
how you can deal with that risk.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.360
As we said this transfer thing
happens in a lot of other domains.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.400
You buy insurance for your car, for
your health and things like that.
