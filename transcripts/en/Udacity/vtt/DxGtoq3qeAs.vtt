00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.540
So, once again let's go back and
look and

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.710
detail the scale invariant detectors.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.970
Let's first look at
the Harris-Laplacian.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.270
Again, I've given a reference for those
of you who want to read more about it.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.760
Basically, what is does is it finds a
local maximum of Harris corner detector

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.740
in space, in a Laplacian scale.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.990
Remember, we've looked at how
to do Laplacians already.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.110
So here basically is the best
way to kind of visually see it.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.950
Scale is shown up this way, space is x,
y, that's where the images are.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.770
Scale basically kind of captures
the frequency in the octaves.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.770
First what I basically do,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.640
is I run a corner detector in space
in the image coordinates, but

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.458
then I kind of move up in scale
by looking for the same features.

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:47.400
Using the Laplacians this time,
as I go from one scale to the other.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.420
And that basically allows me to
find now at these different scales,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.330
the feature does have the information
I want, if one scale or the other.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.080
So just to reiterate,
in the scale which is up here and

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.890
then space which is down here.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.750
In space, we are actually just running
a standard Harris corner detector, but

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.120
then we're using a Laplacian
in the scale space here.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.440
So Laplacian in this, Harris in this
gives us the Harris-Laplacian detector.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.640
Again, a widely used detector and
image processing computer vision and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.889
computation photography.
