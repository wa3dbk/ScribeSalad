00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.300
Section two is titled research questions.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.939
A designed study examines the tradeoffs between various non-functional

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.390
requirements, for example, space and time.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.080
Each tradeoff can be expressed in the form of a question, such as,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.750
how are execution times and

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.740
memory footprint effected as the amount of pre-processing computations vary?

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.870
The second section of your report lists such research questions.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.950
Each question should be formulated in a neutral fashion with regard to the due,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.840
dependent variables being measured and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.340
also indicate what factors are being varied.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.540
That is, the independent variables.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.430
And each question should be numbered for later reference in your report
