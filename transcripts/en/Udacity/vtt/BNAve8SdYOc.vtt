00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now for the answer: Well, GUI capture replay tools

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
can capture sensitive information, just as sensitive information

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
may be contained in files.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If you enter a password, for instance, on a webpage,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and this is recorded, this can even become a security issue.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Next recorded scripts may not be replayable in different environments.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Yes, we have seen that.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Finally, recorded scripts may be prone to change as the software

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
of the GUI changes, obviously.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We also have seen that.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
All three apply.
