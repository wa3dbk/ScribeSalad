00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.090
Here's another variable declaration. It's a little bit different from the ones

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.440
you've just seen. This variable has type int. Int stands for integer. You can

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.450
use a variable with this type to save positive and negative numbers without

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.330
fractional parts. Now that you know what int means, take another look at this

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.640
variable declaration. What is the initial value of the variable in this

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.930
variable declaration? Is it int, mannedMoonLandings, 6, or there isn't one?
