00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.150
Another thing I want to discuss
is the implementation of a heap.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.210
Though heaps are represented as trees,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.290
they are actually often
stored as arrays.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.200
How is that possible?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.430
Well, since we know how many
children each parent has, two, and

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.600
thus how many nodes will be at each
level, we can use a little math to

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.830
figure out where the next node will fall
in the array and then traverse the tree.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.860
Let's convert this sorted
array into a tree.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.220
We know that the first element is going
to be the root since it's the biggest.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.160
The next two elements in the array
are the children of the root.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.580
By convention I insert
them from left to right.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.400
However, that doesn't really matter as
long as they're on the second level.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.510
Again, each level on the tree is
twice as big as the one before it, so

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.140
we know the next level
has four elements.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.160
We can do this programmatically
by tracking the size of

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.929
each level in a variable, then doubling
it each time we move to a new level.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.950
And everything left over fills in
the left side of the last level.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.940
Now you're done.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.290
Just a quick note.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.130
Not every array can be
represented as a heap.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.339
This one could because it was
sorted in descending order.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.490
In general, the numbers need to be in
an order that will make sense on a heap.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.960
Storing our data in an array
can save us some space.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.960
If we use an array,
we just need to store the node value and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.330
index in the array slot.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.240
However, if we created some
kind of node object for

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.630
a tree, each would need pointers
to children and parents, so

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.649
we need to store values and
a bunch of pointers for every element.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.670
Since the array saves us the pointers,
it saves us space.
