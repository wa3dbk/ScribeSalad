00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.690
Now, the general form of what we've been seeing is called the Remainder

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.712
Theorem. Over all, the remainder theorem tells us that the remainder we'll get

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:12.870
when we divide a function f by x minus a is going to be equal to f of a.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.530
Exactly what we get when we plug in a for the value of x into the function.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.820
Now, their remainder actually has really interesting implications for graphs.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.395
We'll see that when we let a function equal the division of two polynomials and

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:30.348
their remainder is not equal to zero we get some pretty cool graphs. We'll end

00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:33.476
up seeing things like this. The remainder's instantly involved in the way that

00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:37.223
the curve breaks into these different pieces. We'll come back to that later,

00:00:37.223 --> 00:00:39.469
though. We don't need to worry about this for now.
