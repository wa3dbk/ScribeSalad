00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.090
Qualitative research can be
a little bit difficult to pin down.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.480
It's really exploration of
unstructured and naturalistic data.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.050
For example,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.620
if you are trying to develop a tool
that will improve learning, you might

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.630
interview some students that you hope
will use your tool to understand

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.580
what they struggle with and
what they like.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.792
Or you might choose to observe
a classroom just in its natural

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:22.750
environment, taking notes on its
various dynamics that you see at play.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.710
The downside of qualitative research
is that its often not as generalizable.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.880
It might be transferable
to new environments, but

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.670
it doesn't generalize out to some
objective truce the way we can sometimes

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.410
get with quantitative data.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.090
With education we often have
to use qualitative research

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.890
because there are so many things
going on in the classrooms, so

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.970
many things going on in
the learning process.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.820
That boiling down to a couple
of clean numbers just

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.240
loses the real magic of what's going on.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.240
So qualitative research is something we
use very often in educational research

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.960
because it helps us
capture the real range of

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.980
all the different interacting
parts of the learning process.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.180
So here we'll talk about the different
kinds of qualitative research.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.980
We'll talk about case studies and
interviews.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.870
We'll talk about how to do them and how
to make sure that the conclusions that

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.200
you get out of these kinds of research
are still valid and sound and useful.
