00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's a question for you that is somewhat involved,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and I really want to check your intuition.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Suppose we have 5 grid cells as before

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
with an initial distribution that assigns 1 to the first grid cell and 0 to all the other ones.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's assume we do U = 1, which means with 0.8 chance

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in each action we transition 1 to the right.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
With 0.1 chance we don't move at all,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and with 0.1 chance again we skip and move 2 steps.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Again, let's assume the world is cyclic,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so every time I fall off on the right side, I find myself back on the left side.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The question is suppose I run infinitely many motion steps.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Then I actually get a what's called a "limit distribution"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
What's going to happen to my robot if it never senses but executes the action

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of going 1 to the right on our little cyclic environment forever.?

00:00:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
What will be the so-called limit or stationary distribution be in the very end?
