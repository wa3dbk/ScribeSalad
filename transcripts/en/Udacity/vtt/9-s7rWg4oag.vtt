00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.110
Okay. Another protocol I'd like to talk about is SOAP. Actually,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.700
I'm just kidding. We are not going to talk about SOAP. SOAP

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.670
is based on XML. It's another protocol for communicating between two

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.220
machines. If you ever have to deal with it, you'll know why

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.860
that I don't even want to bother teaching it. It's very,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.880
very complicated. But what I would like to list for you are

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.530
a bunch of other common protocols and formats for communicating across

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.230
the Internet. Now SOAP is one of them. We won't be spending

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.818
any time on any of these. But lots of people use them.

00:00:27.818 --> 00:00:31.130
For example, hip monk, a lot of our data sources communicate via

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.180
SOAP. It was invented by Microsoft to make communication online as complicated

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.430
as possible. We've got protocol buffers,

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.920
which are from Google. Similar to concept

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.800
to json, it's a way of encoding different types of data for

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.470
sending it over the wire. And there's another one called thrift. This

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.740
is by Facebook. Now you've got all sorts of like, plain text,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.270
plus some formats. Now, these are not all. You know? SOAP kind of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.680
defines a whole protocol. Protocol buffers are really, you know, how to encode

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.440
data. Thrift is how to encode data over the wire. These, these compare

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.620
more to JSON. Soap compares more to HTTP plus JSON. Kind of the

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.000
whole package. The protocol and the data type. Of course, you can always

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.880
just build your own plain, plain-text, you know, protocol and, and data format,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.600
but I wouldn't recommend doing this. It's not that hard to just use

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.870
JSON instead. And then, you know, somebody else who comes along and needs

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.660
to use the service, whether it's, you know, outside of your company or

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.890
internally, they don't have to figure out, you

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.826
know, how to, you know, write all this custom

00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:22.460
code to parse, parse your custom stuff. Because JSON

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.420
and Thrift and protocol buffers and SOAP, you can

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.750
find implementations of these in almost any language. We

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.010
mention XML and JSON. Those are also in this

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.670
list. Use something that already exists, it'll save everybody

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.210
a lot of time. I probably wouldn't use SOAP.
