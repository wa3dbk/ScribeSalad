00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And I'm sure you guessed this correctly--we're taking the sum of the outcomes of the normalized

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
by the total number of experiments and because the outcomes is 0 and 1, the sum over here

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
cannot exceed the value n; hence, this expression over here will always be between 0 and 1,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which is the value of probability.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For reasons that should be obvious in a minute, we call this the maximum-likelihood estimator.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Keep this formula in mind--it is a really good way to guess an underlying probability

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that might've produced any given data set.

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's generalize this to more than two outcomes.
