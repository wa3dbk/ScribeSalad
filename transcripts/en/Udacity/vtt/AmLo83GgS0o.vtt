00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.860
To analyze this line, we need to know where it hits the y axis, and at what

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.160
angle. This angle is generally referred to as the slope. Which is essentially

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.930
the amount that y changes, when x changes by 1 unit. In other words, when x

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:26.150
moves 1 unit from here to here, y changes from here. Note that this is a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.810
positive relationship, and we want to find, what's the change in y when x

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.950
increases by 1 unit. That's the slope, but remember in the case of regression,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.820
this line represents how much y is expected to change, when x changes by 1

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.850
unit. Therefore, when we write the equation for this line, we denoted it by y

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.320
hat. There are many ways to symbolize the y-intercept and slope. You may have

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.870
learned the generic y equals mx plus b, which at least in the United States, is

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.504
usually how it's taught. That's where m represents slope, and b represents the

00:01:05.504 --> 00:01:10.830
y-intercept. But really, we can symbolize them any way we want. The important

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.190
thing is that once we decide on how to denote them, you have to remember that

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.020
and continue to use that later. We can also write it like this, because

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.880
addition can go in any direction. 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2. The slope times x

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.300
plus the y-intercept is the same as the y-intercept plus the slope times x.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.800
Sometimes one of these, the slope or they y-intercept, might be negative. So

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.060
it's just important to keep that in mind. As long as we keep those negatives

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.845
and positives signs correct, the order doesn't matter. The slope and

00:01:44.845 --> 00:01:49.590
y-intercept are called regression coefficients. And sometimes when we use

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.790
software to calculate their regression line, they'll present it in this first

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.770
way. For this lesson, we're going to use b to symbolize the slope, and a to

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.910
symbolize the y-intercept. Given this, what will be our generic equation for

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.780
the regression line? Select all that apply.
