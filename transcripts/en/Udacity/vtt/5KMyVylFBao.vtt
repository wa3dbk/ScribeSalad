To start solving this problem we're going to let d equal the number of dimes and

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:08.646
q equal the number of quarters. The question indicates the variables that we

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:12.798
need to use. In this case we need to know how many of each coin we have. So we

00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:17.213
need two variables, d and q. We need to set up two equations. One will involve

00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:21.883
the number of coins And the other would involve the value of the coins. We know

00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:26.671
the number of dimes plus the number of quarters has to equal a total number of

00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:31.661
coins. A register only contains dimes and quarters and it has a total number of

00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:36.504
21 coins. So if we add the number of dimes d to the number of quarters q, we get

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:41.255
21. Here the variables are taking the place of the numbers. We don't know the

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:45.781
number of dimes so we use d, and we don't know the number of quarters so we use

00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:50.353
q. We know the total value of the coins is $2.70. A dime is worth $0.10. So to

00:00:50.353 --> 00:00:54.675
get the value of dimes we multiply $0.10 by the number of dimes we have. A

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:58.978
quarter on the other hand is worth $0.25 cents. So to get the value of the

00:00:58.978 --> 00:01:03.540
quarters. We multiply 25 cents times our number of quarters, q. And if we add

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.099
these two values together we should get $2.70. I've rewritten the two equations

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:12.387
down here and now we can use either substitution or elimination to solve this

00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:16.566
problem. I'm going to use substitution since I can easily solve for one of the

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:21.180
variables in this first equation. If we subtract q from both sides of this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.945
equation, we'll get d is equal to 21 minus q. Now that d is solved for we can

00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:31.028
perform substitution and plug in 21 minus q, and for d in our second equation.

00:01:31.028 --> 00:01:35.861
Next I distribute 1 tenth to 21 and negative q. I combine like terms. Nest I

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:40.752
subtract 2 and 1 tenth from both sides. And finally I divide both sides by

00:01:40.752 --> 00:01:45.202
fifteen hundredths. I get Q is equal to 4, which stood for the number of

00:01:45.202 --> 00:01:49.882
quarters. So we have four quarters. But I still need to find the number of

00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:54.451
times. My first equation I plug in 4 for Q to find the number of dimes, D.

00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:59.278
Solving for D, I get D is equal to 17. So we have 4 quarters in a register and

00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:03.983
17 dimes. Let's go back to our original problem and make sure that this makes

00:02:03.983 --> 00:02:08.888
sense. We said we had 17 dimes and 4 quarters. Well, the total number of coins

00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:13.714
should be 21 and, yes, those two add up to 21. So we know this first equation is

00:02:13.714 --> 00:02:20.126
true. 1 dime is worth 10 cents, so 17 dimes would be worth $1.70. 1 quarter is

00:02:20.126 --> 00:02:26.583
worth 25 cents, so 4 quarters would be worth $1. And with simple addition we

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:33.144
know that $1.70 and $1 add up to $2.70. So the second equation is true as well.
