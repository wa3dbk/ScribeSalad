00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The answer is this one.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
They both display a negatively sloping somewhat linear relationship.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If we look at this one, the relationship look something like this,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so a bar chart would look something like--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Whereas this one would just have some equally spaced bars, and this one would actually

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
be the same thing because there's just more noise but it's the same flat non-relationship.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Whereas for this one, we can see we could draw bars kind of like that.
