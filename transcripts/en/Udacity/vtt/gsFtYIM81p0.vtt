00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.246
Let me just remind you the reason why I love

00:00:02.246 --> 00:00:04.683
this lecture is that there is a series of common

00:00:04.683 --> 00:00:07.517
mistakes that first time an even experienced

00:00:07.517 --> 00:00:10.051
entrepreneurs make in thinking about revenue

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:12.983
and pricing. And the first one is that this whole

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:15.652
idea about revenue stream, Steve, I get it. You

00:00:15.652 --> 00:00:17.852
know, revenue stream. It’s about the price, the

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:20.104
dollar amount I am charring customers.

00:00:20.104 --> 00:00:21.451
That’s a mistake.

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:24.637
And you will see later that pricing is a tactic.

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:27.185
Or maybe I kind of get it, okay, now I understand

00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:30.414
that pricing is a tactic, but I’ll set the price

00:00:30.414 --> 00:00:33.299
of a product based on how much it costs me

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.515
to make it. Well, how else would you set pricing.

00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:37.847
It cost me 99 cents to make it. I’ll charge

00:00:37.847 --> 00:00:40.818
a $1.25 and, you know, that’s kind of a reasonable

00:00:40.818 --> 00:00:43.646
price. We’ll also see why that might be a huge

00:00:43.646 --> 00:00:46.027
mistake and leaving lots of money on the table.

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:49.262
And then kind of the third common errors, my

00:00:49.262 --> 00:00:51.094
price hast to be less than my competitor’s

00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:54.826
price. If they’re charging $5,000, the best way

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:57.744
to enter a market is to charge $4000. Why

00:00:57.744 --> 00:01:00.677
– no one would pay any more than the existing

00:01:00.677 --> 00:01:02.777
incumbents. And we’re going to see that’s

00:01:02.777 --> 00:01:05.058
another going out of business strategy. And

00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:08.661
all this depends on your knowledge that you’ve

00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:11.494
just learned about the customers, their reaction

00:01:11.494 --> 00:01:14.209
to the value proposition and all the work you’ve

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.562
been doing outside the building. You’re

00:01:16.562 --> 00:01:18.712
going to have an incredible advantage

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:21.481
in thinking about revenue and pricing.
