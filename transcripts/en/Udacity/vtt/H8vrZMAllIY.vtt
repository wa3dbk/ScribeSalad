00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.110
So the goal for the rest of this unit

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.910
is to modify our search engine code to implement

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.450
the PageRank algorithm. We have one little problem. PageRank

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.340
is a registered trademark of Google. So we're not going to

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.110
call our algorithm PageRank, even though it will do

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.340
the same thing. We'll call it URank. The first thing

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.860
we need to be able to do, to implement

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.930
this ranking algorithm, is keep track of the link graph.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.500
So our popularity of pages depends on the link structure. So that means, we need

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.620
to keep track of, what pages link to what pages. So, for each link, there is

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.610
a connection between pages and we can think

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.410
of that, as a graph. Abstractly, a graph

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.020
is just a set of nodes, we'll draw

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.900
those as circles, with edges between the nodes.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.150
And because our edges go one way, just like

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.350
links in a page, we call this a directed

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.170
graph. So, in order to represent our web link

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.150
structure we need to build the directed graph. The pages

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.910
in the graph are the nodes. For each page,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.850
we need to keep track of the edges that connect

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.090
that node to other nodes. And so the way

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.030
that we're going to do this is to keep a dictionary.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.700
So we're going to have a dictionary where the entries

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.200
in the dictionary are the node, which is the URL,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.190
that's the page. And for each URL, we'll have a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.440
list of all the pages that it links to. So

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.430
if this was say node a, and these were nodes

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.990
b, c, and d, our entry for node a would

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.750
contain the list b, c, d. And our entry for

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.380
node b, well, there are no edges out of b,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.690
so it would be an empty list. And finishing the example, C has an out link to

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.560
one node, and D has no out links. So

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.480
that's our goal. We want to build a structure

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.100
like this that shows the structure of the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.840
webpages that we crawl, and we see that structure

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.530
because we're following the links in our crawler. So

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.830
our goal is to modify the crawl web procedure

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.139
that we defined at the end of Unit Five. And to

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.940
modify it so that instead of just producing an index, it

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.340
also produces a graph. So we're going to modify crawl web. It's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.730
going to still take a seed page as its start. But what

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.560
it's going to produce now is both an index and a

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.960
graph. And the graph is a structure that gives a mapping

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.960
from each node to the pages that it links to. So

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.690
let's look at the code that we had at the end of

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.900
Unit Five and see how we need to change that. So

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.820
here's the code, that we had at the end of unit five,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.370
for crawling the web. And as a reminder, we're keeping track

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.370
of the pages left to crawl in the list tocrawl starting with

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.740
the seed page, and we're building up the index as a

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.910
dictionary. And as long as there are pages left to crawl, we

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.740
go through the while loop, which finds a page to crawl,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.590
popping the list of pages to crawl. As long as this one,

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.060
we haven't crawled before, it gets the content from that

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.640
page. It adds it to the index. It finds all the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.400
links, using get_all_links, passing in the content on the page and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.660
unions those with tocrawl to update the tocrawl list and then

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.830
it appends this page to the list of pages, that have

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.130
already been crawled. So to change this to build a graph,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.070
we're going to keep most of the code the same. In addition

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.610
to producing just index, we're going to produce a graph. And the

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.180
graph is also going to be a dictionary. And the reason the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.990
graph is a dictionary is that the mapping from nodes, which

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.300
are urls, to the list of edges that go out from

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.690
that node. So we'll create the graph as an empty dictionary.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.630
And as we find new pages, we're going to add them to

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.980
the graph. And we're going to also change the return to return

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.500
both the index and the graph. I'm going to make one more

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.640
change before we give you a quiz. And the change I'm

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.840
going to make is, instead of calling get_ all_links here,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.550
Since both the graph building and the tocrawl list depend

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.110
on knowing all the links, we're going to create a

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.710
new variable. And we'll assign the result of get_all_links(content) to

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.970
that variable. That means we can use those links

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.990
as the input to content. But we can also use

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.110
them to build the graph. And I'm going to leave

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.920
the line that we need to build a graph for

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.650
you to complete. So we'll make that a quiz, to finish

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.209
this code. Write the line that we need to update the graph.
