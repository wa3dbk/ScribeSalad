00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.518
So now we have this wonderful straight
forward equation for the amount of money

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.159
that Grant's friends are going to pay him
once they buy their glasses, wiper, and

00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:10.894
their spray nozzles. However just when we
think we're starting to figure things out

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:14.757
for him situation gets a little bit more
complicated. Even though this means more

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.663
work for us, this is great for Grant,
because more of his friends have asked if

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:22.731
they can buy his products. The day after
his first round of requests came in, even

00:00:22.743 --> 00:00:26.483
more of his friends and his friend's
friends heard about his new incredible

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:30.969
inventions, and asked him to add to them,
to the list of people to buy his products.

00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:35.950
51 more people requested glasses wipers,
and 25 more people wanted to buy 2 spray

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:40.613
nozzles each. This equation no longer
tells us the total amount of money that

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:45.650
Grant's going to earn from his friends,
and his friend's friends buying his wipers

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:50.270
and nozzles. So, what we need to do is
create a new equation. We need to come up

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:54.845
with a different way to express a that
takes into account this new information

00:00:54.857 --> 00:00:58.135
that we have, but also doesn't forget what
we had before.
