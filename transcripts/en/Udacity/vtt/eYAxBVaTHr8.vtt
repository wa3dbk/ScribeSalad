What other information can we learn about this function? Well how about this?

00:00:04.644 --> 00:00:09.333
Is it even, is it odd, or is it neither one of those? Remember that for an even

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:14.389
function, f of x will be equal to f of negative x. And for an odd function, f

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.722
of x is equal to negative f of negative x. So, you can try plugging in

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:21.712
different positive and negative values and see if it fits into either of these

00:00:21.712 --> 00:00:23.370
two categories.
