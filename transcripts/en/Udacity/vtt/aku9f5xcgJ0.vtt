00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.050
Privacy begins with the patient.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.029
Only they or their designees can consent
to the use of their health information.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.740
There are a number of models for
obtaining this consent.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.510
Using data without asking for
consent is the No Consent model, but

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.186
this isn't reasonable or
even legal in most contexts.

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:23.900
In the Opt-out Model,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.570
Consent is assumed, unless
the patient specifically revokes it.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.300
Some HIEs are using that Model,
but it would be very unlikely and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.380
probably not even legal for
a healthcare provider to use it.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.940
The converse is the Opt-in Model,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.860
where no data is shared
unless the patient consents.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.823
If you've ever visited a physician,

00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:49.390
you've probably consented to the use
of your data under this Model.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.130
CurrentCare, the Rhode Island HIE
we'll discuss later, uses this Model.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.560
Typically Opt-in is all or none.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.060
So patients can't share some but
not all of their data.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.270
Despite this inflexibility,
at least one study suggests as many

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.020
as 90% of patients will
consent under this Model.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.300
The final Model, Opt-in with patient
specified restrictions, provides more

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.730
flexibility and would probably be the
preferred method if it can be managed.
