00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.719
The result comes back and when the result comes

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.890
back the client box is executing some process C2. The

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.790
kernel has to switch to this client, so that is

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.240
can see the results, an continue with it's execution. So

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.480
this context switch, is again in the critical path of

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.180
RPC latency. So if you look at RPC call, the

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.052
two contact switches that are in the critcal path of

00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:25.520
RPC latency. There's a context switch that happens here and

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.210
the context switch that happens here. So only two

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.450
context switches are in the critical path of the latency,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.170
the context switch that happens on the server machine

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.490
when the call comes in, and similarity, the context switch

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.590
that happens on the client machine when the results

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.620
come in. So this context switch that happens on the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.030
client machine to keep the client machine Utilizied, can be

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.840
overlapped with the network communication to send the call out.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.770
So in other words, this context which is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.690
not the critical path of RPC latency and

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.600
therefore do this context which, while the RPC

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.070
call. Is in transmission on the wire. So while

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.120
overlapping the context switch that happens on the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.810
client box after the call has been sent

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.320
out with the communication time on the wire

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.790
for the opposite call. Similarly on the server side,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.280
once the server is completed execution and it is

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.450
ready to send the results out, send it out of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.110
the wire and in parallel with sending it out

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.580
in the wire, it can overlap The contact that happens

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.310
here in order to keep the server box busy

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.380
doing useful stuff, S2, S2 that can be overlapped with

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.480
this network communication. So, only this contact switch and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.600
this contact switch are in the critical path of latency.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.490
So, we can reduce the number of contact switches

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.370
down to two. Originally we started with 4, we

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.840
can reduce it down to 2. By observing that

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.030
the context which is that happened on the client end

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.540
box and the server box to keep them utilized

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.910
can be overlapped with a network communication for sending

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.840
the arguments over to the server, or sending the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.800
results over to the client. Of course we are greedy.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.919
Can we reduce it to one? Can we actually

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.640
reduce the number of context switches Down to one. Let's

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.430
think about this. So we said that when this RPC

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.490
call was made, the operating system on the client side

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.040
said, well, this is a blocking semantic, and therefore,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.220
this guy is not going to do any useful work, so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.770
I'm going to block him and wait for the results to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.000
come in. So this context switch that c, the operating

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.990
system did on the client side Was essentially to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.460
keep this client box from being under-utilized, but do we

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.170
really need to do the switch? Well, it really

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.840
depends. If the server procedure is going to execute for

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.160
a long time, then, you know, this client box

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.790
is going to be under-utilized for a long time. And

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.900
in that case, it might be a good thing

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.090
to context which in order to make sure that we

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.070
are utilizing the resources that we have. But on

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.870
the other hand, If, suppose, this RPC call, we know

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.980
that this RPC call is going to come back very

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.270
soon. And if it is on a local area network

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.400
and the server procedure that is going to be executed

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.672
is not going to take a long time. Then perhaps

00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:17.980
that RPC call will come back very quickly. If that

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.320
is the case, we can get rid of this context

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.230
switch that we talked about here. In order to

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.930
keep the client box busy, we did this context switch.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.670
Don't do that. We can spin instead of switching

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.760
on the client side. And if you do that, then

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.750
the client is reading but is not being context

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.470
restored. It is just that the box is underutilized, so

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.950
the only context which that we incur. Is the context

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.400
which on the server because you never know when an

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.930
RPC call is going to come in. So when an RPC

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.090
call comes in, you obviously have to contact switch into

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.140
the server context in order to execute the call. That's

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.390
the necessary evil. We'll incur that. But on the client side,

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.740
what we're going to do is, we're going to spin instead of

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.470
switching so that. Even though the box is underutilized, you're not

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.390
doing anything on the client side, just sending the call

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.780
out and waiting. And in that case, we've gotten rid of

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.970
the second context switch that you need to incur. Because

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.660
another context was stalled and therefore this context switch which we

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.400
said is in, inevitable, because. It has to be done

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.310
in order to receive the results for the client. Well, we

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.850
can get rid of it if we never switched in

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.060
the first place, and that's the trick here. To reduce the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.340
number of conflicts which is down to one, we can

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.030
spin on the client side instead of switching so that we

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.840
can be ready to receive. The results of

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.370
the RPC call execution when the server is done.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.690
Again, the intent here is that we wanted to

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.570
the latency that is incurred in the RPC call.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.810
And since these two contract switches were in the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.720
critical path of the latency, we would really like

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.390
to see how we can elimintate at least one

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.110
of them. And this context which is inevitable and

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.730
this context which we can eliminate, by spinning on

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.180
the client side instead of switching in the first place.
