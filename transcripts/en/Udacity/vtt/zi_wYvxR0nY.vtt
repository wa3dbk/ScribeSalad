When we find the midpoint between two points, we're really just taking the

00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:09.905
average of their x-coordinates and their y-coordinates. In the quiz before this

00:00:09.917 --> 00:00:14.481
one, we found that the midpoint between points a,b and cd is just a plus c over

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:20.294
2 b plus d over 2. This x-coordinate here of the midpoint, is just the average

00:00:20.306 --> 00:00:24.300
of a and c. And the same is true of the y-coordinate for b and d. So, thinking

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:28.569
of finding midpoint this way, as just averaging x and y coordinates, sometimes

00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:32.601
makes the math feel a little more intuitive and easier to remember how to do.
