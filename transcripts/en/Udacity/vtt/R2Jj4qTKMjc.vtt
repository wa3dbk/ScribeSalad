00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And the answer is, of course, that greedy would choose 12 vertices because it always

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
chooses the ones with which it could cover the most edges. So this one here,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
this one here, this one here, this one here, and so on.

00:00:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And that is, of course, a total of 12 vertices.
