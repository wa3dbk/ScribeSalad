00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
There's three simplifications that we'll introduce to make analyzing algorithms easier for us.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.450
The first one is we will talk about a way that we can analyze algorithms without actually having

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.120
to implement them, which we already that a lot of times.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.890
The second simplification is going to be that we're not going to consider all possible inputs

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.100
that an algorithm can be run on, but we're going to only consider the worst possible inputs

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.600
and I'll say more about what that means too.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.420
And finally, I'll introduce a notation to you called Big O-notation that will allow us to ignore

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.110
details that for now we'll call unnecessary, so that we can really focus on the parts

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.350
that are important for an algorithm and ignore those that we're not interested in.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.300
What do these simplifications actually look like or how are we going

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.770
to go about those simplifications.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.650
First of all, to analyze an algorithm without implementing, we're going to consider

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.810
a special kind of computer, which is not really a computer but a model that comes pretty close

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.070
and that model is called the RAM.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.560
Looking at the worst possible inputs is a concept called worst-case running time,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.910
and finally to be able to ignore all unnecessary details, we'll use a type of notation

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.280
called Big O-notation or Landau notation.

00:01:16.280 --> 99:59:59.000
So let's start out with our theoretical computer called the RAM.
