00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.060
So I think it's important for
each co-founder to interview each early

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.090
employee that walks through the door
in the first few months of the company.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.690
You want everybody to be aligned
that this new hire is good,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.600
not only for the business, but
for the company's culture.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.100
There's no one way of testing for
the culture.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.920
It's really a feel.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.220
But I think there's very specific ways
to test on the professional side.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.500
But on the cultural side,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.950
it's making sure that that person
is aligned with what you do.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.600
So asking them about their experiences
in previous places of work,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.850
the work they've had,
what they liked and disliked.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.510
What are they looking for
in terms of a job, right?

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.220
Those are the things that
you need to be ask for

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.960
and then I think overspending
time with that person is key.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.244
Don't just make quick hires because you
need somebody to walk through the door,

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:57.963
you spend an hour,
looks good, let's get going.

00:00:57.963 --> 00:01:01.496
Actually, spend more time
than you thought originally,

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:04.388
especially in the early
days of your startup.

00:01:04.388 --> 00:01:08.170
Because you want to make sure that
person is right for the type of business

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.880
you're building, not just
professionally, but culturally as well.
