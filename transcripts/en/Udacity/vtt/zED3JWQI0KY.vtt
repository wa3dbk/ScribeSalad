00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.210
So now when we have written all this code,

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.610
let's look at how to scale your application, using

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.048
modules. Modules are a serious heavy-duty function within App

00:00:09.048 --> 00:00:12.430
Engine and they allow you to partition your code, have

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.940
better control over scalability, and do version control and

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.590
online upgrades. For simplicity, we did not use modules when

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.460
building Conference Central, but it is something we strongly

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.270
suggest you start exploring on your own. By looking at

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.100
the online documentation. All right, let's get started. When

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.900
you create an App Engine application using modules, it will

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.650
conceptually be structured like a tree. At the very

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.510
top, we have the root, which is your application, and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.570
your application is made up of a number of

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.140
modules, in this example two. A module groups three concepts.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.180
Code related to the module. The instance class that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.350
should be used to execute the code, this is the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.430
speed of the CPU, and the amount of memory

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.120
that should be used. The scalability parameters including the number

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.823
of instances to start and their life cycle. So

00:00:58.823 --> 00:01:02.970
a module groups code to be executed, the performance resources

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.450
and the scalability and instance life cycle you want to

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.260
have. Each module can then have a number of different

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.700
versions associated with it. A version is essentially a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.170
version of your code being maintained in the module. So,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.760
after you have deployed your application into production you

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.180
can deploy new versions of your code and you

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.550
can have multiple versions running in parallel, and gradually

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.920
migrate traffic from the old version to the new. This

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.100
capability allows you to do version upgrades without having

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.470
to bring down your application. Something that is extremely difficult

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.500
to do without App Engine. And finally, there are

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.060
instances. An instance is what actually executes the application code.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.460
And if you want to scale your application, App Engine

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.690
can fire up more instances to manage the additional load.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.450
And since the instance class and the number of instances

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.040
define the performance and scalability of a module. The capacity of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.040
your application depends on the instances class and the number

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.270
of instances you run. This is configured on the module

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.840
level, and that is exactly what we will look at

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.220
now. How to configure a module. let's start looking at two

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.590
scaling options for modules. Manual Scaling and Automatic Scaling.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.950
These specify different scale up and scale down characteristics of

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.910
instances. Manual scaling allows you to create instances that are

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.240
always up and running and that never terminates. Because of

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.600
this, they don't have the ten minute execution limit

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.360
with they process tasks or cron jobs. Since they are

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.870
always up and running, they can work for any amount

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.310
of time. And that means that they are great to

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.660
use if you have long running background tasks or

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.370
cron jobs. The only thing you need to configure for

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.290
manual scaling is the number of instances you want

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.710
the module to start. That's manual scaling. Let's now talk

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.630
about automatic scaling. Automatic scaling is the option that

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.620
allows App Engine to automatically scale your application up and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.610
down depending on the load. The first two options

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.770
you can specify for automatic scaling is the minimum and

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.390
maximum number of idle instances you want. What does

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.740
this mean? Why would you want to have idle instances?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.110
Well, instances have a startup time and if you

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.730
don't want your users to wait for the response while

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.000
your application needs to scale up by starting new

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.460
instances, and it could be good to have idle instances

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.730
available if your application needs to scale up. So your

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.240
users don't have to wait for more instances to start.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.490
Let's now look at latency. Where you can specify

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.830
the minimum and maximum pending latency allowed for requests. These

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.480
parameters work as follows. So let's say a request comes

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.900
into your application right here, and there's no instance available

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.580
to process it. Then it is put in a wait

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.680
queue. App Engine now has a decision to make. When

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.970
to scale up your application using more instances. Well, to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.500
begin with, it will wait for some time to see

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.030
if any of the existing instances become available to

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.380
process their request. This is called a minimum pending

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.500
latency, if this time passes, App Engine is considering

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.680
starting a new instance to manage the request. And if

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.570
the next pending latency time expires, then a new

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.850
instance would be started for sure to manage the load.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.270
This is how App Engine performs a scale up

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.620
of your application. Rather than specifying a number for these

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.790
four parameters, you can all set them to automatic.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.279
In such case, App Engine will set them according

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.280
to the dynamic analysis it performs. Finally, both manual

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.601
and automatic scaling have a common configuration element. Which is

00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:29.290
the Instance Class. The instance class specifies the speed

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.000
of the CPU and the amount of memory to

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.760
use for each of the instances started. Check out

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.750
the developer documentation for more details on the options available.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.215
As you probably see by now, modules is

00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:44.260
heavy-duty stuff. And in addition to the scaling options

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.730
we looked at, it also has versions that

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.970
we briefly touched on. Versions allow you to perform

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.670
online upgrades on part of your system without

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.870
any service disruption. Without App Engine, doing automatic scaling

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.710
and dynamic upgrades are extremely difficult problems to solve.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.100
So make sure that you use this great functionality.
