00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.050
The accelerometer is
an incredibly flexible and

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.870
intuitive way for
your user to interact with your game.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.120
The accelerometer reports
the phone's acceleration in meters

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.640
per second squared.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.440
So if the phone is stationary,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.460
the only acceleration it's experiencing
is the acceleration due to gravity,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.180
which is equal to about 9.8
meters per second squared.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.390
Does this sound at all
familiar from physics class?

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.500
Now regardless of the orientation
used by your game, the accelerometer

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.960
data is reported as though the phone
is in portrait orientation,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.660
with the positive z-axis
coming out of the screen.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.860
That means if the z-axis of
the accelerometer is reading about 9.8,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.660
the phone is flat on its back.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.060
If the z axis is reading negative 9.8,
then the phone is resting on it's face.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.210
If the y axis reads 9.8 then the phone
is upright in the portrait orientation.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.590
Note we have tilted the phone a little
bit and the y axis is reading positive.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.710
If we tilt the phone this way a little
bit, now the x axis is reading positive.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.690
Libgdx allows you to pull for

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.880
accelerometer readings using gdx
input get accelerometer x, y and z.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.130
We can compute the total acceleration
using the good old Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.705
Down here we're drawing
those red bars you saw, and

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:15.035
this is actually the horizontal bar.

00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:17.855
Notice the x position
of the end of that bar

00:01:17.855 --> 00:01:20.995
is being determined by
the negative y axis.

00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:23.820
That's because we're looking at
this game in landscape mode.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.610
And all of the accelerometer readings
are reported as though the phone

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.420
was in portrait mode.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.900
Here is the vertical line.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.140
And the end of that line is
determined by the positive x axis.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.900
You'll get a hold of
this quickly enough.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.330
But if everything is sliding sideways
in your game, this is probably why.
