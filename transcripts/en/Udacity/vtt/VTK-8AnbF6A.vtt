00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
A good way to get started with such a problem is to write out what sorts of strings are matched.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:19.000
There are things like 1 space 1, 1 space 123, because of this plus, 2 space 456, and so on.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
One of the things that we notice quickly is that they all have a space,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
they all start with a single digit, and they don't have any letters in them.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Is a1 space 2 part of the possible return value?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, it would have to match this regular expression and be in the string.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's in the string but it doesn't match this regular expression,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because it starts with an "a" and none of our things start with an "a."

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
How about 1 space 2? That looks pretty good.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We have 1 space 1, and we could pick a different digit, and it's in the string.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It could be a part of our return value.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
1 space 2b--it is in the string, but we never have any letters in this regular expression.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It doesn't match.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
2 space 3--this has the right format. It matches our regular expression.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But it's not actually in the haystack string, so it can't be part of the return value.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
44--this has the wrong format. We need a space in the middle.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
3 space 44--this has the right format, it matches our regular expression,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and it actually occurs in the string. Great.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
3 space 44d--this has the wrong format. Again, we're not matching any letters.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.092
So just these two.
