This time, we have x times x times x time x times x times x, that's a lot of x's

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:09.535
to write down. So, what's a different way that you can rewrite this term using

00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:14.485
exponent notation? Please just use one number or variable in the base, and one

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:19.295
number or variable in the exponent. Remember that on a computer, you need to

00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:24.010
write the base number and then the carrot sign, and then the exponent number.
