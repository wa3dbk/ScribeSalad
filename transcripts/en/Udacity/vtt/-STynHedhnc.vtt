00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.394
I get rid of those little boxes just to make our whole graph area look a little

00:00:04.406 --> 00:00:08.914
bit cleaner. Since our x values need to range from negative five to five on this

00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:13.409
portion of the axis that we've drawn, each of these grid lengths needs to count

00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:17.689
for one. So, when we step from zero, one step over, we need to label that one,

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.378
two, three, and so on. And you see we get to five on the positive edge of the

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.545
axis. Counting in the negative direction, we had the same scale. So, we have

00:00:26.557 --> 00:00:30.442
negative 1, negative 2. And you can see, I even made a mistake when I was

00:00:30.454 --> 00:00:34.491
drawing these axes. I made our x-axis one longer than it needed to be, which

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:38.988
doesn't really hurt us, so I'm going to leave it as is. I apologize for my lack

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.890
of perfection here. Now, in the y-direction, we need to be able to go from

00:00:42.902 --> 00:00:47.122
positive 10 all the way down to negative 20. We have 5 boxes up here and 10

00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:51.171
boxes down here. So, that means we need to count by 2s with each step of teh

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:55.455
graph. So, moving from 0 up one box, is going to actually be stepping 2 in the

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:59.973
y-direction and then down into the same scale again. Now, again, the point of

00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:04.126
creating these scales and these limited links for either access is really just

00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:08.147
to make our lives easier a little bit when we're graphing. The x and y values

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.060
for this graph do extend, actually, all the way from negative infinity to

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:16.238
positive infinity. We're only going to graph part of that infinitely long line,

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:19.579
in particular, the part that shows these values on this graph.
