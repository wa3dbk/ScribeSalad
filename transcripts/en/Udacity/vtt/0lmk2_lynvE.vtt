00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.840
The example we just talked about was calculating the

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.530
total sales per store. And there are lots of

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.680
other things we can do with MapReduce that actually

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.780
quite similar to that, for example, log processing. Say

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.910
we had a set of logs from a web server which looked like this. You may want to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.700
know how many times each page has been hit.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.630
Well really, it's similar to calculating the sales per store.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.990
Your mapper will read a line of the log at a time. And it will extract

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.520
the name of the page. Such as, index.php. It's intermedia data. We'll have

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.470
the name of the page as the key. The intermediate data we use index.php

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.750
as the key and 1 as the value. This is saying that that page was

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.560
accessed one time. Then we'll continue into the other

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.460
lines of the file just like that. When all the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.870
mappers are done the reducers will get the keys,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.710
which are just all the pages on our website, and

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.760
a list of values which will be a list

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.150
of ones, meaning how many times that page was accessed.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.830
The reducers can add up the ones to know how

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.900
many total hits that page had on our web site.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.360
Simple, but far more efficient, than writing

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.650
a standalone program to go through all

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.140
the logs start to finish. Especially, if

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.690
we could have hundreds of gigabytes or more.
