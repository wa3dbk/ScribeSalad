00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.400
So let's consider what we learned about ARP. So

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.340
what are the formats of the queries and responses in

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.360
ARP? Is the query a broadcast where a host

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.590
is asking about an IP address, and the response is

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.640
a Unicast with a MAC address? Is the query

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.860
a Unicast message asking about an IP address and the

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.770
response is broadcast with a MAC address? Or is

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.730
the query a broadcast asking about a particular MAC address,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.720
where the response is a Unicast with the response of a particular IP address?
