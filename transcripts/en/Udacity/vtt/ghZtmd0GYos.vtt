00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.330
The IP addresses we've seen so

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.570
far in this course are specifically
IP version 4 four addresses.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.190
There are two major versions of
the Internet protocol in use

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.010
today, v4 and v6.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.510
v4 is the older one that the majority
of Internet traffic is using today.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.390
We'll talk about v6 more
in the next lesson.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.910
For now.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.150
Just be aware that there are both of
these kinds of IP addresses out there.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.200
And that they look pretty
different when we write them.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.610
And there you're going to be
seeing these more and more.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.550
Right now the ones we're
talking about are these.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.210
The IPv4 addresses are usually
written as dotted quads.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.910
That's four numbers separated by dots.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.580
Each of these four numbers is
one byte or octet, or 8-bits,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.100
which means that mathematically it
could be a value from 0 to 255.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.720
Wait a minute, why 255?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.520
Where did 255 come from?

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.760
If you already know the answer to that,
feel free to skip

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.780
the remainder of this lesson and
pick up again with lesson three.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.710
But if you're not quite sure why 255 is
an interesting number, keep watching.
