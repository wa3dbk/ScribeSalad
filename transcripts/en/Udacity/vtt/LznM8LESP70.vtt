00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. There we go, so I screwed up the even-odd test.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Okay, so xmod2=1, that is to say if we had an odd numbered run through our outer testing loop,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we're going to bias the probability towards removing from the queue.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Otherwise, we're going to bias towards adding to a queue. Okay, good.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This time, we added to a non-full queue 600,000 times

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
added to a full queue almost 400,000 times removed from a non-empty queue 600,000 times

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and removed from an empty queue close to 400,000 times.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This time, even with 1,000 element queue, by adding this bouncing back and forth behavior,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we managed to do a good random testing.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If you think about it, this idea of adding a new outer testing loop

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to a random tester is often a pretty good one.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If you think about it, that's exactly probably

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
what we would end up doing from the file system example.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
For special case, mount and unmount, probably what that's going to mean is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
hard coating are call to mount at the start of a random file system test,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
then executing a bunch of API calls, that is to say opens, closes, make directories and stuff,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and at the end, we're going to hard coat and unmount call.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What that fails to do is interesting stress testing of the mount and unmount logic,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and so remember, if we call mount and unmount with equal probability

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
as the rest of the calls that was too many times.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But if we hard coat a call to those at the beginning and end of our entire

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
random testing run, that's probably too few.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
What we can do is mount the file system, do a bunch of stuff, unmount it,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and then enclose that in an outer testing loop to make sure that we sort of stress

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
all the parts of the system that we intend to stress.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We can imagine that the state machine from the file system case is considerably more complicated

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
than the state machine for queue,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
but on the other hand, we could still do this diagram or something like it

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and we find that we need to adjust our probabilities.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is a sort of a deep topic and it's a difficult one. Let's take at one more example.
