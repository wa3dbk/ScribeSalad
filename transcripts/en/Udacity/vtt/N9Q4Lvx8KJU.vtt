00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.030
Let's discuss the machine
learning based approaches.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.480
Machine learning approaches can
automatically build a model

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.450
using the labeled normal training data.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.290
That is, a machine learning algorithm

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.130
fixes input examples of normal data and
outputs a model.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.260
That is then able to classify
subsequently observed data

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.340
as either normal or anormalous.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.830
Machine learning base models can
automatically handle small changes or

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.430
variations in the observed data.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.300
It can also capture
the inter-dependencies or

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.940
the deeper connections between
the measures of the observed data.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.160
On the other hand for these approaches
to be effective the normal training data

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.610
must be representative of
normal behaviors otherwise

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.500
when we apply the model to detection
there could be a lot of false positives.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.790
In addition in the training phase
it required a lot of data and

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.463
a lot of of power.

00:01:00.463 --> 00:01:05.269
However, once the model is produced
subsequent analysis is typically,

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.230
fairly efficient.
