00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
How can we use a minimum spanning tree for shortest tour?

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.430
Well there's actually one more thing we need to talk about in terms of terminology

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.570
so that I can give you an algorithm for shortest tour.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.890
Then you will hopefully be able to explain to Dave as well, should he ask you.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.390
The edges are still there, but we will just look at the minimum spanning tree for now.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.790
The terminology that I would like to introduce to you is that of a walk along a tree.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.120
Of course you can define this formally, but it's actually quite easy to see.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.800
What I mean by this is if you want to do a shortest tour on a tree,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.460
then a shortest tour on a tree goes something like this.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.070
You start out at a certain vertex, and then you can travel along that tree

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.820
by using every edge exactly twice.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.960
Just the way that I'm doing right now.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.580
Actually it's not possible to do it any other way.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.460
I mean of course you can walk along the tree in a different order,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.920
but actually if you want to do a walk along a tree, then you have to use every edge twice.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.870
Then of course you return back to your origin.

00:00:54.870 --> 99:59:59.000
This would be a walk along the minimum spanning tree.
