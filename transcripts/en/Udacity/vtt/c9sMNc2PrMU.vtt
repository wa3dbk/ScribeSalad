00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.640
When a server receives
an HTTP request it returns

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.840
a response message to the client.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.680
This response can contain
the information requested or

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.830
an error message if there was one.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.240
Similarly to the HTTP request message,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.020
the response consists of a message
header and optional body.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.190
The first line of the header
is called the Status Line.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.540
Followed by optional response headers.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.280
The status line contains the HTTP
version, status code, and

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.780
a reason phrase that explains
the status code in English.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.470
Here are some common status codes and
reason phrases.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.990
The optional response headers take
the form of name value pairs,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.980
similarly to their request
header counterparts.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.798
the response message body contains
the data that the client requested.

00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:46.719
If the client asked for a web page,

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.578
a sample response might
look something like this.

00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:55.640
When you search the web, your web
browser takes care of creating HTTP

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.110
requests and
rendering responses onto your screen.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.030
But as an API developer, there will
be times when you have to create and

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.410
dissect these messages yourself.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.420
You'll learn some ways to
do this in the next video.
