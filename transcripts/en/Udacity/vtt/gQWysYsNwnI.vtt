00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.070
Now that we discussed some important concepts about

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.060
software architectures, I would like for you to

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.290
tell me which of the following sentences is

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.420
true. Prescriptive architecture and descriptive architecture are typically the

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.970
same. Architectural drift results in unnecessarily complex architectures.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.320
Architectural erosion is less problematic than architectural drift. And

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.660
the best way to improve a degraded architecture,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.250
is to keep fixing the code until the system

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.270
starts looking and behaving as expected. Which of these sentences is true?
