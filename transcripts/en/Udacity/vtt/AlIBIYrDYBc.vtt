00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.850
Let's create a route where we can view
the details of each of our menu items.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.020
Remember that all of the items
share the item template.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.310
Let's generate the item route.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.970
This updates the router, creates an item
route and template file and a test file.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.169
Remember that this is just shorthand for
this.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.770
To add a dynamic segment for
this route, we need to modify the path.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.130
Remember that dynamic segments
have to start with a colon.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.710
This will hold the name
of the menu item.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.740
Let's add something to the item template
so we'll have something to see.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.800
I'm hard coding in a menu item's name,
image, rating, and description.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.280
We need some way to get to
the item page from the menu, so

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.630
let's add a link to each item.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.480
Now we can get to an item's detail page.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.850
Right now though we've hard coded this
menu item into the item template.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.180
So even if I try to view the strawberry
pudding, I'll still get the ham and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.365
goat cheese croissant.

00:00:58.365 --> 00:00:59.210
We'll fix this in a bit.
