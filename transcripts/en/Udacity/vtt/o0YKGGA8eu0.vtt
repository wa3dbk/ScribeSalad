00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.460
Two fundamental objects in
geometry are points and vectors.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.550
Essentially, a point is
a location in space.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.090
We represent a point visually as a dot.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.820
And given a coordinate system,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.890
we can represent it point by
its coordinates in that system.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.290
For example, in two dimensional space,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.840
the standard coordinate system is
the Cartesian coordinate system.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.326
We represent a point in the system as an
ordered pair of coordinates, first the x

00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:27.613
coordinate and then the y coordinate.

00:00:27.613 --> 00:00:32.738
So this point located two units
to the right of the origin and

00:00:32.738 --> 00:00:37.979
one unit below the origin
would be represented as 2, -1.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:38.860
In three dimensions we can

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.480
represent a point in the similar
way as a triple of course.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.258
First its x coordinate, then its y
coordinate, and then its z coordinate.

00:00:45.258 --> 00:00:46.800
In contrast to a point,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.080
a vector is an object representing
a change in position.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.470
In Euclidean space,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.840
a vector can be thought of as
an arrow connecting two points.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.300
The important properties of a vector
in Euclidean space are its magnitude,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.190
that is the length of the arrow and
its direction.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.610
Given the coordinate system,
we can numerically represent a vector

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.430
by the amount of change it represents
in each coordinate direction.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.920
For example,
this vector moves right by two units so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.690
we would give it an x-coordinate of 2.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.570
Since it moves up by four units,
we give it a y coordinate of 4.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.330
Notice that I write a vectors
coordinate representation

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.630
differently than I do a points.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.910
I will usually write a vector as
a column surrounded by square brackets.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.510
While I will write a point as a list of
coordinates it surrounded by parentheses

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.710
one major difference between a point in
a vector is that a vector does not have

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.150
a fixed If I draw the same arrow
starting at a different point,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.070
it will still be equal
to the first arrow.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.860
This is an important distinction.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.680
Two vectors are equal if they
represent the same amount of

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.980
change in each direction
while two points are equal,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.970
only if they are located
in the same place.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.920
Despite this difference,
while studying Linear Algebra,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.470
we usually conflate the notion of a
point in a vector in the following way.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.470
Given a coordinate system,
the point P is associated

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.400
with the vector obtained by starting at
the origin and ending at the point P.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.170
While this is usually
a useful mental shortcut,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.420
it is sometimes helpful to remember
the difference between the two concepts.
