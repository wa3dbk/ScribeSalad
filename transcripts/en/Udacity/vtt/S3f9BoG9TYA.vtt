00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.570
let's take Mora's advice and move away from using histograms. Up

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.990
to this point we've looked at distributions of single variables. For

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.460
example, friend count, and at most we looked at different subsets

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.270
of friend count by splitting it, using a factor, or in

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.780
our case it was gender. Now we're going to look at

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.600
two continuous variables at the same time. So, to get started,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.510
make sure you're in the right working directory, and then go

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.010
ahead and load your data set and load the ggplot library.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.440
Usually it's best to use a scatter plot to examine

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.150
the relationship between two continuous variables. Q plot chooses the

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.350
scatter plot automatically when we pass two continuous variables to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.580
the x and y parameters, so let's go ahead and

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.610
do that. I'll pass age to the x parameter, and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.750
I'll pass friend count to the y parameter, and finally

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.220
I'll indicate that my data set is pf, my pseudo

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.200
Facebook users. Now, there's over 99,000 observations in our data,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.230
so when we create this plot, it might take a

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.120
few moments to render. And there it is. We could also

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.190
write this code which will produce the same exact plot. This

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.239
time, I'm not using the x and y parameters explicitly. And

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.790
that's okay, because qplot knows which variables to use on which

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.470
axis. X will come first, and y will come second. I'll

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.030
run this code, just so that way you can see the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.220
same plot being produced. And there we go, we have a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.460
pretty ugly scatter plot, but what are some things that you noticed, right away?
