00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.430
Now, we have all the tools we need to draw a parabola from an equation.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.056
Regardless of what form it's in, when we first look at it. We can find the

00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:10.840
vertex, and we can find the x and y intercepts. This will definitely give us

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.828
enough points to connect into a smooth curve. So let's put all of this together.

00:00:14.828 --> 00:00:19.010
If we have the equation, y equals x squared plus 5x plus 4. What are the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.633
y-intercepts of the graph, its x-intercepts, and its vertex?
