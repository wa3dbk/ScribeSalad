00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.690
After the participant sections come the collaborations sections.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.360
Collaboration is

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.640
how the participants work together to accomplish the pattern's goals.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.770
The composite pattern is an example of a structural pattern.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.600
One in which the organization of the information provides the primarily,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.270
the primary value added.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.300
For structural patterns, collaboration plays a less important role than

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.558
structure in providing information to the designer.

00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:27.970
Nevertheless, understanding inter-element behavior is important.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.700
For example, with the composite pattern,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.610
a typical behavior is to have the composites iterate through their children,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.590
performing some operation on each.
