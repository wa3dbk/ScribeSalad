00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.599
We've now spent quite some time looking at expressions, thing like 2 x cubed

00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:09.182
minus 7 y squared plus 28. Now expressions are great and useful and all, but we

00:00:09.194 --> 00:00:13.715
can't actually solve anything when we just have an expression. To be able to

00:00:13.727 --> 00:00:18.050
find solutions, we need equations. We've already looked at how to set up

00:00:18.062 --> 00:00:22.569
equations, but just to remind you, what is an equation actually? Here are a

00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:26.532
bunch of choices for what an equation might be, and I'd like you to pick the

00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:27.162
best answer.
