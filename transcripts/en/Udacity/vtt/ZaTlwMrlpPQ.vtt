[Norvig] Here I've added the tests.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For a straight flush the value is 8, the value for a straight flush,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
followed by a 10, because 10 is the high card in this particular straight flush.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
For 4 of a kind the value is 7, indicating 4 of a kind,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
then a 9, indicating that we had four 9s,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and then another 7, indicating that the remaining card was the 7 of diamonds.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And for a full house the value is 6, 6 meaning full house,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
followed by a 10, meaning that we had three 10s,

00:00:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and a 7, meaning that we had two 7s.
