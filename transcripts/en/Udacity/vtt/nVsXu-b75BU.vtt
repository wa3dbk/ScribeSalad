00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To get the equation for the line, you can look at the slope and the intercept--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the intercept being 1.1 and the slope being -0.4.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
An important point to take care of when we pick the constant in front of that

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
quickly decaying expression is that the coefficient of friction should be 0 when the wheel slip is 0.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So if you plug in 0, you'll find -A * 1 + 1.1, meaning that A has to be 1.1.

00:00:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And implementing this in Python is of course straightforward.
