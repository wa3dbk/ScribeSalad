00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.220
Okay, let us set aside predicate calculus, and return back to population logic.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.690
Recall that we had found ways of writing sentences in population chronologic.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.129
We had found rules of inferences, we could prove theorems.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.430
We could find the truth value of new sentences.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.220
However, we found that those methods were computationally, not very efficient.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.420
So AI has developed more efficient methods.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.420
One of those methods is called Resolution Theorem Proving.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.810
Let us take an example to illustrate how resolution theorem proving works.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.590
So, imagine there is a robot, and this robot.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.400
Is working on an assembly line,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.390
it's a factory robot, and on the assembly line are coming weird kind of widgets.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.360
The robot's task is to pick up each widget, as it comes on the assembly line and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.070
put it in a truck.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.940
However, there are some humans in this factory.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.720
Who play a joke on the robot once in a while,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.220
they glued the widget to the assembly line belt, so that,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.170
when the robot tries to move it, it can not move it.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.840
But the robot is a smart robot,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.910
this is a logical agent, so when it can not move it.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.550
It uses its logical reasoning, to figure out that the boxes aren't liftable.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.960
And the moment it knows that the boxes aren't liftable,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.400
it let's go of the box and moves onto the next one.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.970
Everyone got the story?

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.420
All right.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.220
So let us suppose that the robot begins with some knowledge in

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.650
its knowledge base.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.400
And this knowledge in its knowledge base,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.300
that it begins with says that if cannot move, then it implies that not liftable.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.740
Now, it tries to move the box, the next box in the widget.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.640
It's biceps tells it, it can not move.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.410
It needs to prove that it's not liftable.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.690
And of course this is a preview example and I'm sure you'll understand it.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.580
You can put essentially a class of the modest components to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.220
prove that it's not liftable.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.670
If p then q, p therefore you can infer q.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.820
But, we'll use this example to show.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.410
How does resolution theorem proving works?

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.330
So, the first step in resolution theorem proving is,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.480
to convert every sentence into a conjunctive normal form.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.920
A conjunctive normal form of a sentence, can have one of three conditions.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.720
It can have a literal.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.940
That can be either a positive atom, or a negative atom.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.500
It can have this disjunctional literals like here can-move, or

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.970
not liftable, or it can have a conjunction of disjunctional request.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.690
In this example the third condition doesn't occur.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.850
So, the first thing we must do is to take the first sentence.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.320
The negation of not move implies not liftable.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.010
And remove the implication,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.050
because an implication cannot occur in conjunctive normal form.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.340
So the first thing we need to do is,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.150
to rewrite the sentence, the first sentence, to remove the implication.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.820
Because the implication cannot occur in a conjunctive normal form.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.590
So now we use the.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.500
Implication elimination rewrite rule.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.110
To rewrite this in the form of can-move, or not liftable.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.100
Remember that was alpha implies beta becomes, not alpha or beta.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.620
So the not of negation of can-move becomes can-move or not liftable.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.380
So, we have done it for the first sentence.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.580
This is now in a conjuncted normal form.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.440
We can do the same thing for the second sentence, but

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.540
wait, the second sentence already is in a conjunctive form.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.777
We don't have to do anything.

00:03:36.777 --> 00:03:40.199
Now, the robot wants to prove that their box is not liftable.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.060
Resolution to improving, is like proof by refutation.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.030
To do proof by refutation we will take the negation of what we want to prove.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.230
We wanted to prove not liftable would take its negation,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.540
which makes it liftable.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.860
Okay, so now we got three sentences.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.150
This one's the first sentence that the robot was bootstrap with,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.730
you've just converted to a conductor normal form.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.200
This was the sentence that came from a it saw that the box cannot move.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.830
And this is the sentence throughout the negation of the sentence,

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.850
the refutation of the sentence that it wants to prove.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.339
So we have three sentences now.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:22.140
The first sentence came from the bootstrapping, of the robot's knowledge base.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.620
This is the axiom that the robot assumes to be true.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.810
The second sentence came from its percepts.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.370
The robot tried to move the box, it could not move it.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.310
The third sentence is coming from taking the negation of

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.640
what the robot wants to prove.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.710
It wants to prove it's not liftable.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.140
So, it's going to take this negation of it and then, sure that it's going to

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.380
lead to a null condition that we'll view as a contradiction.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.120
The resolution for

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.540
improving lawless begin with a liftable in the sentence that we want to prove.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.320
So here that sentence is liftable, and we'll look for a sentence that contains

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.140
a negation of liftable in this sentence that we want to prove.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.498
So the sentence here was liftable, sentence S1 contains liftable which is

00:05:03.498 --> 00:05:06.030
a negation of that so we pick S1 and not S2.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.130
Note, how efficient it was to decide what sentence on

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.990
the knowledge based to go to.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.830
In sentence container negation of the liftable.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.690
So, liftable and not liftable can not both be true.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.710
We know that, and therefore we can eliminate them.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.100
This is called resolution.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.470
We resolve unliftable and we remove them from the sentences.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.470
Now, we were sentence as S1, that leaves us can move.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.230
So, now we pick a sentence, that has the negation of literal can-move.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.520
Sentence S2 has a negation of that, and we can resolve one can move,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.120
they can not both be true.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.330
When we resolve on both of them, those get eliminated as well.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.990
And now we see we've reached another condition.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.710
This null condition represents a contradiction, and

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.930
now we can infer that liftable cannot be true, therefore not liftable is true.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.180
The robot has proved not liftable.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.400
And in this case it appears as a resolution theorem improving is

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.020
more complex there's more respondents.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.570
In general it is not.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.160
It just appears here,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.010
because this condition happened to fulfil the form of more respondents directly.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.658
In general, deciding on which sentence to apply the modest ponents on, and

00:06:22.658 --> 00:06:25.793
how to combine those groups of inferences don't suddenly become

00:06:25.793 --> 00:06:29.620
[INAUDIBLE] harder than deciding how to apply the resolution and improvements.
