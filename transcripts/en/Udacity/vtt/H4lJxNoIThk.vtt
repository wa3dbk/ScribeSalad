00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.060
Naturally, once you've initialized
a dictionary you're going to want

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.410
to add items to it.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.250
To add a key value pair to a dictionary,
set the value for

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.840
the key using subscript syntax.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.190
So here we'll add a couple of entries
to our animal groups dictionary.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.680
A group of crows is called a murder.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.120
I always thought that was a strange one.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.700
And a group of monkeys
is called a troop.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.150
If we use the count method, which has
the same syntax of the array classes

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.560
count method, we can see that before we
had three entries, but now we have five.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
And if we print out the dictionary,
we can see the two new entries.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.880
Removing a value from a dictionary
looks very similar to adding a value.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.940
But in this case, the value for
the key is assigned to nil.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.530
And after we assign the value for
crows to nil.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.750
We can see that the crows murder pair
has been removed from the dictionary.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.680
What if we want to change
the value associated with a key?

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.760
For this we have a couple options.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.120
We can keep using the same versatile
subscript syntax like this.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.380
Here, let's change troop to barrel, or

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.720
we could use the method update value for
key.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.250
This method is interesting because
it returns an optional value.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.740
This is good because if you try to
update a value that's not in your

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.480
dictionary.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.890
Your program will crash.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.920
The update value method will
just return nil And go ahead and

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.800
add the new key-value
pair to the dictionary.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.490
And here you can see we've added a crash
of rhinoceros to our dictionary.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.040
No pun intended, I swear.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.710
If the dictionary does indeed contain
the value you tried to update,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.790
the update value for
key method returns the former value.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.950
The old value.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.940
Like we saw here when
the method returned flock.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.860
If you want to retrieve the value for

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.300
a particular key you can use,
you guessed it.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.040
Sub script syntax.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.210
In other words, the dictionary name
followed by the key in square brackets.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.170
Let's scroll this up and
make a little more room.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.280
One has to be careful when
retrieving values from dictionaries.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.650
Because retrieving a value for

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.010
a given key from a dictionary
returns an optional.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.088
Why would a dictionary
return an optional?

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:04.808
I'm just going to pause for
a few seconds and let you think.

00:02:08.168 --> 00:02:11.520
It returns an optional because there's
always a chance that the key value pair

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.040
you're looking for
isn't in the dictionary.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.990
There are many cases in which a program
might ask for a value from a dictionary,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.970
not knowing whether it will be there or
not, so it returns an optional.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.540
And naturally,
that optional needs to be unwrapped.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.150
We unwrap a value returned from
a dictionary using if let,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.670
just like we'd unwrap
any other optional.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.430
In this example we want to retrieve
the value for a group of whales and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.560
use that value in this print statement.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.600
So we unwrap it like so.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.490
And here the optional has a value, pod.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.300
So what happens if the key isn't found?

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.030
No problem, we're covered.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.500
Like in this example.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.710
Sasquatches are not in our dictionary,
so the optional has a nil value.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.620
But that's okay because we've specified
exactly what we want the program to do

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.730
in case of a nil value.
