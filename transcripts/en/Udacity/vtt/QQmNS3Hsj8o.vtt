00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.411
You've seen how arrays can store a sequence of values such as this one. Here we

00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:10.221
have three prices for three different kinds of gasoline. Well, what if we have

00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:13.805
two gas stations in this case you'll want to store a two dimensional

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:19.870
arrangement with rows and columns, two dimensional arrays can do that. In this

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.199
example we would have three rows and two columns. In Java we get such a

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.039
arrangement by saying, give me a new array of doubles, of floating point

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.780
numbers and I want three rows, two columns. In general, the first number is the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.514
number of rows, the second one the number of columns. Note the type, it's a

00:00:38.514 --> 00:00:43.663
double brackets brackets meaning, it's a two dimensional array, of numbers. If

00:00:43.663 --> 00:00:47.303
you already know which numbers should go into the two dimensional array, then

00:00:47.303 --> 00:00:52.334
you can supply them like this. Again, here I have a two dimensional array, of

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:57.880
prices. And now, you put a, pair of braces, for the entire array, and then for

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.870
each row you put another pair of braces with the values. So here we have three

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.715
rows, each of which is enclosed in a pair of braces. Now you know how to

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:13.470
declare a two-dimensional array. Next let's have a look at how we can access

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.999
its elements.
