00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.352
It's worth doing a quick recap of how we expect the parameter this to behave.

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:08.050
Again, it's almost exactly like an input parameter.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.770
But rather than being bound to the value that is supplied between the parens,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.390
it's bound to the value that's on the left of the dotted call time.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.314
So this function is going to log first ob1 and then ob2.

00:00:18.314 --> 00:00:21.586
Here are the call time parens and this is the binding for

00:00:21.586 --> 00:00:24.490
the first positional parameter.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.180
And here we have the call time dot and the binding for the parameter this.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.340
Back in our example, these are the call time parens.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.610
There's nothing being passed in and bound to positional parameters and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.840
here we have the call time dot and the binding for the parameter this
