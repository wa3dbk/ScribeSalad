00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's check your knowledge of that with a multiple choice quiz.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Here a number of times I've written the sentence "George Orwell was really Eric Blair."

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You might think I've written it, say, 1984 times, but really, just four.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I hear if you repeat something like this enough, it becomes true.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What I'd like you to do is mark in this multiple multiple choice quiz

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which of these will end up showing the world "really" in bold.

00:00:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
They can show other words in bold, but I want to know that they'll show "really" in bold.
