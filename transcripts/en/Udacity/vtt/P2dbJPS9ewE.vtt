00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:06.980
not mobile-focused. We've placed links to some

of the more popular ones in the instructor notes here for you

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.190
to check out. If you want to be able to place your app

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.520
can be deployed on many platforms. There are several app wrappers listed in

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.810
the Instructor Notes here too.
