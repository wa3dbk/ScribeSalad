00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.485
So let's say we have this code where again

00:00:03.485 --> 00:00:06.715
R1 is compared to 0, and we branch here

00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:12.530
if it's equal to 0. If it's not equal to 0, we do this and branch out. If it

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.430
is equal to 0, we do this and continue.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.811
We have seen that this code results in four instruction's

00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:22.870
worth of execution, when we have the conditionals MOVs.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.050
Two instructions that actually do the work of ADDIs. And

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.700
two instructions that conditionally write results back to R2 and R3. With full

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.410
predication, a la the Itanium, we get the condition check

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.230
is done using the predicate set instruction that

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.780
compares equal zero on R1 and sets P1 and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.280
P2 accordingly. The predicates are always set opposite of each other so

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.816
that if R1 is zero P1 is set to true and P2 to false. If

00:00:57.816 --> 00:01:04.342
R1 is not equal to 0 then P1 is set to false and P2 is set to true. Now we can

00:01:04.342 --> 00:01:10.092
simply do the add i of 1 plus r2 into r2. But we will predicate it with p2,

00:01:10.092 --> 00:01:12.276
so that it only gets done if r1 was

00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:16.380
not equal to 0. And then, this instruction becomes

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.204
exactly what it was here. Except that now it's predicated so that it only gets

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:28.160
done if r1 is equal to 0. So as you can see with this, after we do this

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.880
initial instruction that simply sets the predicates, any

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.690
code that was here simply gets predicated with

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.820
one of the conditions. The opposite condition predicates

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.930
the other branch's code. And that means that first

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.120
of all we can use the same registers that we

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.740
used before. We don't need the additional R4 and R5

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.110
that we had in the previous example. And second, we

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.442
still do have the work of both parts. But there

00:01:56.442 --> 00:01:58.861
is no additional work to now move the results into

00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:02.680
the registers, the type of destination registers. So the overhead

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.160
here is kind of similar to what we had with branches.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.008
With branches, we needed to have the branch, and then the

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:15.168
code from either pass. Here we have the condition set, followed from the

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:18.910
code from both paths. So the only really overhead that we have in terms

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.260
of executing more instructions, comes from doing the work of both paths instead

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.150
of just one. But there are no

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.840
additional instructions to select between the results.
