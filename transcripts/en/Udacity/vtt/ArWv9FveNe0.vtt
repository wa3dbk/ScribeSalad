00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.190
One feature of shadows that is not captured well by basic shadow mapping is how

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.220
lights truly cast shadows. All lights have an area, but shadow mapping assumes

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.597
the light comes from an infinitesimal point. Unless the real light itself has

00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:14.810
an extremely small filament and no diffusing bulb surface, treating it as a

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.344
point of light is a weak approximation at best. The area fully in shadow, where

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:23.124
no part of the light is visible, is called the umbra. Real lights cast shadows

00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:26.500
with areas that are neither fully in shadow nor fully in light. This area of

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.872
the shadow is called the penumbra. An interesting way to look at the problem is

00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:32.518
from the point of view of a location in the penumbra, however much of the area

00:00:32.518 --> 00:00:37.489
of the light is visible correlates to how much light the location receives. For

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.198
example, the green point on the ground here can see about half of the emitter

00:00:40.198 --> 00:00:44.335
above, so it will receive about half the emitter's light. You have the worry

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:47.173
about the angle of the surface normal to the light, the light's distribution of

00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:49.796
energy and so on, but the major factor is how much of the light's surface is

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:52.349
visible to each point.
