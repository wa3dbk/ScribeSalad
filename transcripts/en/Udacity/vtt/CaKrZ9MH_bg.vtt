00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.350
Well this sounds great.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.810
Are there any down sides,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.440
or where are you as far as
implementing this in your company?

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.580
&gt;&gt; So, we haven't implemented
it everywhere yet.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.570
We're using it right now almost
exclusively for generating forecasters.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.680
Although we've started using it in some
newer applications for similar variance.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.831
We're not generating whole
applications with it yet,

00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:27.036
we're generating mostly
components of applications.

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:32.430
So there's a lot of opportunity
there to expand its use and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.970
we're looking into that.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.570
Also, I think I mentioned that

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.270
this whole approach is based
on a lot of prior work.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.390
In particular, it's based on the work
on these layered assemblies,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.350
the GenVoca approach, the Head approach,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.360
all the work of David Parnas,
Don Batory.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.700
That work is quite rich, and so
we've been able to borrow heavily

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.435
from it to get the LayerBlox
to where it is right now.

00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:09.330
But that prior work also has
gone on beyond what we've done.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.360
So there are some pretty nice
things you can do in some of

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.120
Batory's latest work where you can
actually think about generating product

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.480
lines of product families.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.110
Which, if you can imagine,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.070
would scale much larger to
building whole applications.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.020
We don't have any support for
that yet in LayerBlox, but

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.140
that's something we're looking into.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.230
&gt;&gt; So
let me get a little clarification here.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.810
You used the term product line and
product families.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.730
Can you differentiate those two?

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.060
Probably the best is to give an example.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.350
So what we've looked at so
far is how to use LayerBlox to generate

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.120
different forecasters,
different variants of a forecaster.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.000
But a forecaster is one kind of product.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.043
Often what you find, and
what we have to deliver to customers,

00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:56.193
is a family of related projects.

00:01:56.193 --> 00:01:59.547
Such as a forecaster that works together
with a replenishment system that works

00:01:59.547 --> 00:02:01.910
together with a promotion
planning system.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.700
And what you really would
like to do to scale this up

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.038
is to be able to generate product
lines of entire product families.

00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:12.750
And that work is,
there is existing research in that area.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.780
But we have not incorporated that yet
into LayerBlox.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.710
&gt;&gt; So, there's this family
of compilers called GCC that

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.900
are capable of targeting
various platforms.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.587
But also they can be used for different,
the technology can be used for

00:02:32.587 --> 00:02:35.080
different programming languages.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.810
Is that related to this product
lines and product families?

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.377
&gt;&gt; Interesting question.

00:02:41.618 --> 00:02:43.071
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:46.090
I wouldn't think of a compiler
as a product family.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.040
But to the extent that it is not for
a single language but

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.870
for multiple languages, like GCC can
be used for FORTRAN and for Ada.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.340
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.350
probably a good way
of thinking about it.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.770
&gt;&gt; Anything else you'd like to say about
the current status of LayerBlox or

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.940
the things you'd like
to do in the future?

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.660
We're interested in integrating
LayerBlox itself in this method

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.490
of composition more tightly into

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.108
the programming language that we
use to build our applications.

00:03:14.108 --> 00:03:16.260
Right now LayerBlox is
a separate generator.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.910
But historically, this kind of approach
has almost always started that way,

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.225
started with a separate generator.

00:03:24.225 --> 00:03:27.415
But then led into very tight integration
into a programming language.

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.191
And I think that's probably
where this belongs.

00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:33.198
That will then let us do much more
sophisticated analyses of type

00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:35.430
correctness of these assemblies.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.070
It'll help us make
some better decisions.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.070
You mentioned the generality
versus performance problem,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.770
which could at some point crop up.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.130
I have no doubt that,
eventually, it might.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.420
By integrating this more tightly into
the programming language, you get more

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.980
opportunities for having more context
when you're doing generation.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.050
&gt;&gt; Is this anything like
the generic capability in Java?

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.672
Where you can generate collection
classes of various types by

00:04:05.672 --> 00:04:07.070
parameterizing them?

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.111
&gt;&gt; It's very similar, yeah, so in fact
that tends to be that kind of method.

00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:15.127
The use of templates that are supported
in the programming language is

00:04:15.127 --> 00:04:19.560
often ways that this general model gets
tightly integrated into a language.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.547
So there was some work, Janusz Mardok
just did some work on integrating

00:04:25.547 --> 00:04:32.110
this very approach into Java, in
exactly the way you're just suggesting.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.260
So yes.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.900
&gt;&gt; And we will put on the class
resources page some links to some

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.850
of the papers that Kurt is
referring to in case you want to

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.600
look into them a little more deeply.
