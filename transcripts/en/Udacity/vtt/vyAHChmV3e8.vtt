00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.482
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is definitely going to be a big issue for us to help Grant tackle. So, I

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:07.267
think we should break this problem-solving down. I also recognize that there are

00:00:07.267 --> 00:00:10.292
a lot of words on the screen right now, and that can definitely feel

00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:14.056
overwhelming. But if we just take things step-by-step, we can figure this out.

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:17.737
Let's start by talking about what we actually know right now. What information

00:00:17.737 --> 00:00:21.680
does the problem give us? Read through this problem statement again, and then

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.391
tell me, what do we already know. Do we know how much Grant should spend on

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:29.378
nozzle machinery? Do we know how many nozzles he should make per month? Do we

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:33.431
know how much materials for each nozzle cost? Or do we know how much Grant wants

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:35.368
to spend total on nozzle production?
