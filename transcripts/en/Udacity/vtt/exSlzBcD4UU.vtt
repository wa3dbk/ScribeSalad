00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.665
The last choice is the best one. Factoring by grouping won't work for this

00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:07.689
cubic. We just pulled out next, so we don't want to remultiply it back in.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.206
There are no like terms to combine. And if we divide both sides by x, we'll end

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:15.526
up with f of x over x here. And that's not really very helpful. The best way to

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:19.993
find potential zeroes, of this polynomial, is to use the rational zero theorem.
