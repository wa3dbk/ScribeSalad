00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.402
Let's say you meet a new classmate and you agree at a local coffee shop to

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:08.441
study. You've met this person at the coffee shop three different occasions, and

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:13.630
on each occasion the person's late. After the third time the person comes late

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.802
you think to yourself that this person is just lazy. Or maybe they're selfish

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:21.574
because whatever they're doing must be so much more important than meeting you

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:26.710
on time. This is an example of dispositional attribution, because you're

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.538
explaining the person's behavior from an internal cause, that is that they're

00:00:30.538 --> 00:00:36.532
lazy. So dispositional attributions are when we explain other people's behavior

00:00:36.532 --> 00:00:40.612
as being due to something from within the individual, such as a person's

00:00:40.612 --> 00:00:47.592
personality, talent, attitude, or motivation. So let's take this example again

00:00:47.592 --> 00:00:51.207
of a person being repeatedly late to a study session. Perhaps you think the

00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:54.155
reason why the person's late is because they've gotten caught up with something

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:58.672
at work and couldn't leave on time. Or perhaps because there was traffic or the

00:00:58.672 --> 00:01:02.092
person was home helping their sick mother. If you were to use one of these

00:01:02.092 --> 00:01:05.483
reasons for explaining the individual's tardiness, then you would be using

00:01:05.483 --> 00:01:10.604
situational attribution. A situational attribution, is when we think that

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:14.234
something outside of a person, such as the nature of a situation or

00:01:14.234 --> 00:01:18.470
circumstance is the cause of the behavior.
