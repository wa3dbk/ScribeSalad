00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.620
Now you might be going through these
exercises, and they seem pretty logical

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.210
to you but you're still staring
at a barren desert of zero ideas.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.450
That's okay, seriously,
it happens to the best of us.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.734
And when this happens to me,
I actually go outside.

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:19.890
I go for a walk or swim or
I just sit in the park.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.040
And I find that just being outside
really helps me get creative,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.980
but this might not work for you.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.790
You might want to browse Reddit and
look at funny pictures or

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.470
get inspiration from friends or family.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.820
If you don't have any ideas right now,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.560
the important thing is just
do whatever works for you.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.840
Find some way to get into
a creative mindset and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.020
really just start brainstorming.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.550
Don't worry if your ideas are stupid,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.660
don't worry if you don't
think you can implement them.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.770
Write anything down because you'll
never know what might come of it.
