In 1988, Michael Kearns and Leslie
Valiant posed the following question.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.400
Can a set of weak learners be combined
to create a single, strong learner?

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.279
One answer to that
question came in 2009.

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.783
Back in 2006,
Netflix offered a $1 million prize for

00:00:18.783 --> 00:00:22.988
a machine learning algorithm that
could do 10% better than their own

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:27.350
algorithm at predicting which movies
their customers would like to see.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.033
The prize was not awarded until
three years later in 2009.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:37.905
The winning algorithm was not a single
algorithm, but a combination of several,

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:39.500
or an ensemble.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.940
This lesson is about ensemble learners.
