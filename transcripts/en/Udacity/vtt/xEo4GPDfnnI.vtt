00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.950
The answer is that L is recognizable.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.720
A machine that recognizes
L is fairly simple.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:13.170
It just feeds the input 100010 into
M and then accepts after M halts.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.390
If M loops, so then so
will this machine.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.420
If it doesn't loop,
then this machine will accept.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.350
Note that it's not clear if it's
possible to recognize the complement.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.700
If you haven't taken a class on
the theory of computation before,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.020
then you might think it possible that
there are only some dozens or hundreds

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.310
of ways that infinite loops occur, and
that you could check all of those cases.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.590
This is at least unclear,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.060
and as we'll see later,
it actually turns out to be false.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.980
Simulation defer this recognized in
this language doesn't work either.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.930
We can't just run the machine and
wait until it doesn't halt.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.490
That doesn't make any sense.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.430
Another possible idea is
to monitor the machine

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.020
by keeping track of every
configuration it has been in, and

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.340
if it ever repeats a configuration,
to declare that it doesn't halt.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.480
This might detect some
non halting behavior, but

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.630
because a Turing machine's
tape is infinite,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.780
it can run forever without actually
ever repeating a configuration.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.020
Students will sometimes object that
this strategy of monitoring for

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.900
loops would work on any
computer with finite memory.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.100
The trouble is that it would require
more memory than the machine being

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.400
monitored would have access to.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.580
So the monitor would have to be
a different computational model

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.841
than the machine it's monitoring.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.340
As a practical method
of detecting cycles,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.290
this strategy doesn't work either.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.170
Consider the fact that a computer with a
gigabyte of RAM has over 8 billion bits

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.040
and therefore over two to the 8
billion possible configurations.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910
That's a lot of possible configurations
before you detect a cycle.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.620
The bottom line is that this objection
isn't satisfactory, either in theory or

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.850
in practice.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.130
Monitoring and looking for cycles of
configurations just doesn't cut it.
