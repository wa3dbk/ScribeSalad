00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.029
So let's look at another example.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:05.710
Maybe you say, well, the one I
just gave is not that realistic.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.410
What if everybody takes
the exam at the same time?

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.600
Well, that particular attack
will not succeed in that case.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.600
So we're going to craft
a different kind of an attack,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.480
using the same authorized query which
returns the average score on an exam.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.290
So let's say in this case,

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.310
we have only one student with
a standing that is junior.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.180
Because the course, let's say,
is a senior course.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.320
And one smart junior student
chose to take it or enroll in it.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.600
So it's a senior class and we only
have one student who is a junior.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.675
It's useful information that we know
where there's groups of students.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:46.270
Okay, you may ask for the average
scorer, male students, female students,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.740
students who are juniors, students who
are seniors, and things like that.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.960
Because in general, if there are a lot
of junior students, maybe you want to

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.268
know how did you perform relative
to your peers who are also juniors.

00:00:58.268 --> 00:01:02.810
So let's take the query that says,
which also specifies

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.320
the standing of a student, but
it's still asking for average score.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.580
Let's say that's allowed.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.860
So here we get average score of
students when the standing was junior.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.600
So that's where our query says,
where standing equals junior.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.710
In that case, we're still
running the average score query,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.520
so it will take the tuples where
the standing is junior, and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.910
then compute the average on those and
return that value.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.160
Well, that's a problem
if it does do that.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.090
Because in this case, the query's
actually going to disclose the average.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.270
If you're doing average for
one value, then you are actually,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.210
this average discloses the value itself.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.430
So this query, if there's only one
student, of course the result it's

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.330
going to return is going to be the score
of the student who had junior standing.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.440
So this is another example
where I think the reason

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.830
this happens is that we're computing
the average which is an aggregate,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.220
which is authorized as we said before,
over a small set of tuples for

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.900
the exam score values in
tuples that are selected.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.920
In extreme case,
there's only one of these tuples.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.760
And in that case, it's the exact score.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.240
So this query again allows someone to
make an inference, saying the student

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.800
who's standing a junior, this, the
average that we get is his or her score.
