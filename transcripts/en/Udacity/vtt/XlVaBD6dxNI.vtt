00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.540
Somebody is trying to compromise
the security of your system,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.068
somebody who is not authorized is
trying to access your sensitive data.

00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:12.800
How can they attack,
if what's they're asked to attack or

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.079
what they're allowed to
attack is the authentication

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.130
part of whatever security
you have in your system.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.660
So authentication is how you start.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.290
So the target of the attacker here
is going to be how you authenticate.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.000
In particular,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.260
what they're going to try to do is
defeat the authentication system.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.880
So Eve is going to try to be successful
in authenticating herself as Alice.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.520
In that case,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.098
you would have successfully
compromised the authentication method.

00:00:41.098 --> 00:00:44.410
So we're going to do this threat
modeling saying well what can they do.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.760
What can the bad guy or that hacker do.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.890
Well, let's just sort of talk
about the password method.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.120
So remember the password
method is something you know.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.510
And we all know what passwords are.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.910
So let's say passwords are being
used by users to login to a system.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.720
What kind of threats do we
need to be concerned about?

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.590
Well, it's a secret that's
shared between you and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.530
the system, well,
someone can try to guess that secret.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.090
So one threat is the not
having good passwords

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.770
that can be easily guessed by attackers.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.210
That's one threat we have
to be concerned about,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.650
authentication that is
based on passwords.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.040
So this is kind of interesting.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.860
It really is not talking about, how can
you be a user, guess their password, or

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380
steal their token.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.080
But it's talking about
impersonating a real login program.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.580
So think about you come in,

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.720
and we're talking with passwords,
you provide your password to the system.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.860
How do you know you're really
talking to the system?

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.850
How do you know it's not a program
that is impersonating the system?

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.630
All it has to do depending on which
system you have, it has to display

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.760
login, call in, or something like that
for you to provide your login ID.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.720
Or login name and
then it has to display password colon so

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.210
you can type your password, or
whatever the interface that you have.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.120
The is a Trojan horse,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.270
this a program that is impersonating
the system at the other end.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.677
Then what this program is able to do is,
as you type your password,

00:02:16.677 --> 00:02:18.500
it'll be able to steal it.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.040
So what's the last one?

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.980
We're talking about someone trying
to steal your password, isn't it?

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.300
If your computer is infected,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.240
in particular if it is infected with
malicious software called keyloggers.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.811
They are able to capture
the keys that you press,

00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:37.335
you are going to provide your
password by pressing a bunch of keys.

00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:42.583
And so keylogger grabs your password,
okay, so if your are doing a password

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:47.425
method, bad guy has to get hold of
your password, so they become you.

00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:49.495
They can guess it, they can steal it,

00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:53.574
either using a piece of software that
fools you into believing that you're

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:56.760
giving your password to
the operating system.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.280
Or it could run as the real login
program is running and steal these keys

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.180
that you press or the characters that
you press that make up your password.
