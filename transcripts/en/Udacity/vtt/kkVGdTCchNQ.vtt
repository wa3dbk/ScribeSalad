00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.130
Hopefully you're beginning to see why modifications to one rectangle variable

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.260
might affect another rectangle variable. Let's try another example. If I run

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.460
this code. What happens? Does this code draw a blue rectangle and a red

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.735
rectangle or just a red rectangle or just a blue rectangle or just a purple

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:20.761
rectangle?
