00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.705
Since we're on a roll with rational inequalities, let's do one more. We have 1

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:09.305
over x plus 2 is greater than 3 over 2x minus 4. You know that in order to find

00:00:09.305 --> 00:00:13.966
critical values, we need 0 on one side of the equation. So, that means we need

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:18.602
to pick one side of the inequality to get all of our terms on. It doesn't matter

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:22.442
which one we pick, right and left are both totally fine, and we'll get the same

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:26.276
answer. But I'm kind of leaning to the left today, so for the first part of the

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:30.119
problem, I'd like you to rewrite this equation so that all of the terms are on

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.156
the left-hand side, making the right-hand side equal to 0.
