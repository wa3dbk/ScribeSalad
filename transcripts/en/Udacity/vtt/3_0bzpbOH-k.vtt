00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.104
Let's consider our first equation again with x, y and z. This time let's solve

00:00:06.104 --> 00:00:11.490
our equation for x. We can think about cross multiplying or by multiplying both

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.516
sides by x plus y. We distribute the z to get zx plus zy equals 1x. And now

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:21.345
here's where we might get stuck trying to solve for x. Notice that x is on

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:26.205
different sides of the equation. We need to move all the x terms to one side of

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:30.622
the equation, so that way we can isolate it on one side. Any term that doesn't

00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:34.402
contain x should be on the other side of the equation. So let's do some

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:39.418
rearranging. What would be an equivalent equation for this one, out of these

00:00:39.418 --> 00:00:40.125
choices?
