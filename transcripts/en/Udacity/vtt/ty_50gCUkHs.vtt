00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.357
So today we've talked about classification, which is one of the biggest

00:00:03.357 --> 00:00:06.838
problems in AI. We started by revisiting incremental concept learning and

00:00:06.838 --> 00:00:09.497
reminding ourselves how it allowed us to take examples and

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:13.060
abstract away a concept. We then looked at the idea of equivalence classes and

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.276
how we can group sets of percepts into equivalence classes to establish

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:20.640
a particular instance of a concept. Within this is the hierarchies of concepts,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.400
such as the animal kingdom,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.300
where animals can grow kind of into vertebrae, birds and penguins.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.490
We then discuss the idea of different types of concepts like axiomatic or

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.240
exemplar concepts, and how each of them have different definitions and different

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.640
affordances. Finally, we discuss bottom-up search, so instead of establish and

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.760
refine, we look at the lower level variables and abstract up from them. Next,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.110
we're going to move on to logic, which is a little bit unrelated to this.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.000
But if you're interested in classification, you can look ahead to all our

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.270
different lessons on design, such as diagnosis and configuration.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.090
They're going to really heavily leverage our idea of classification.
