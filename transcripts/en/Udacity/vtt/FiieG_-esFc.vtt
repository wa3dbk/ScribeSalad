00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.897
For the first inequality, I have x is less than 3. If you have trouble

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.451
remembering the less than symbol, remember that the arrow points to the left, or

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:12.844
to numbers less than zero. I know I need a parenthesis because I can't be equal

00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:17.188
to. So, it must be the number line 2 or number line 4. I want numbers lower than

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.913
3, because x is less than 3, so it must be 4. For the interval notation, I want

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:26.641
numbers that are from negative infinity all the way up to 3. So, that must be b.

00:00:26.747 --> 00:00:31.325
For x greater than or equal to 3, I want to use a bracket, that's number line 1.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:36.053
The interval notation would be d because I get d equal to 3 and then have any

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:38.915
number bigger or up to positive infinity.

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:43.226
Here, I have 3 is greater than or equal to x. I'm used to seeing the variable on

00:00:43.238 --> 00:00:47.520
the left side, so I'm going to flip this in equality around. I need to make sure

00:00:47.532 --> 00:00:51.689
that the arrow still points to the x when I switch this inequality around. I

00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:55.947
want 3 to be greater than or equal to x, and I want x to be less than or equal

00:00:55.959 --> 00:01:00.625
to 3. For the number line, it must be at number 3. I need a bracket at 3 and my

00:01:00.637 --> 00:01:04.968
values could be less than or equal to 3. The interval notation would be a. I

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.527
could have numbers from negative infinity all the way up, and equal to 3. This

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.871
must mean that the last one is 2c. I want numbers greater than 3. Here are

00:01:13.883 --> 00:01:19.069
numbers greater than 3 and here are numbers between 3 and positive infinity.
