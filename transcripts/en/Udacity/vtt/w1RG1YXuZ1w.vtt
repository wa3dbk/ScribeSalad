00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.515
What we've seen so far, is capable of dealing with simple,

00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:08.430
one-level architectures. However, humans deal with complexity using divide and

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.550
conquer, breaking things into smaller pieces and

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.300
then trying to put them together somehow. For software architecture descriptions

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.492
there are 2 kinds of such Decompositions, Horizontal and Vertical.

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:25.040
Horizontal de, Decompositions are done at the same level of abstraction.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.280
We understand the human body in terms of its digestive, respiratory, immune and

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.140
so on systems. However, we can also decompose vertically by going deeper into

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.760
the abstraction hierarchy, that is we understand the respiratory system in

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.620
terms of Lungs, Trachea, Diaphragm. The Lungs in terms of Alveoli and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.910
gas transfer for example. We have already seen how, Acme deals with

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.150
Horizontal Decomposition in terms of components like connectors and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.920
so on. now let's look at it's support for Vertical Decomposition.
