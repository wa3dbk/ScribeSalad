of code a day do you think professional

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.370
software engineers produce? Do you think they produce

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.160
25 lines of code? Between 25 and 50? Between 50 and 100? Between 100 and 1000?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.720
Or more than 1000 a day? And remember

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.379
that here we're talking about professional software engineers.
