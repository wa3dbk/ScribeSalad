00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And the answer is 0.5, 1/2.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
To see this, recall that there were four possibilities for the numerator--all equally likely,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and if the first flip is heads and we have no other restrictions, the last three flips can be anything.

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.999
So each one has two possibilities and 222=8 and 4/8=0.5.
