00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.850
Now let's begin the discussion on sexual attraction and the qualities we look

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.162
for in potential sexual partners. Now according to the sexual strategy theory,

00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:12.237
men and women approach relationships differently. And perhaps you can reflect

00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:16.501
upon this in some of your own relationships experiences. In terms of how you

00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:20.973
may have approached a relationship differently than your partner. We see that

00:00:20.973 --> 00:00:24.621
in almost all societies, people engage in one night stands, or what we like to

00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:30.422
call, short term meetings. We also have long term meetings, which include

00:00:30.422 --> 00:00:35.885
marriage or extended companionship. So our committed long term relationships

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:41.437
often result in marriage. In one study conducted in the United States, they

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:45.903
found that 86% of women by the age of 40 and 81% of men by the age of 40 will

00:00:45.903 --> 00:00:51.853
marry. If you recall from our earlier lesson on development, we had a question

00:00:51.853 --> 00:00:56.209
on the forums about the age your parents got married. And we discuss the change

00:00:56.209 --> 00:01:00.722
across generations, in regards to the age people marry. Now this is just one

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:06.440
study in the United States. But long term relationships occur in most cultures.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.059
They may do so at different times or ages, and for different reasons. For

00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:14.610
example in some cultures marriages are arranged, so the individuals have no say

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.706
in the matter. But in other cultures people often marry for love, that is they

00:01:18.706 --> 00:01:21.372
fall in love with one another and then they decide to spend the rest of their

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:23.270
lives together.
