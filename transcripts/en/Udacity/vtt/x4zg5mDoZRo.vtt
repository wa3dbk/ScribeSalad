00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.130
So, filtering patterns all have one thing in

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.870
common. They don't change the actual records of our

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.060
data. So by that I mean, if we have some long list of data with lots and

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.060
lots of records. One, two, three, so on.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.700
A filtering pattern will, go through the entire data

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.970
set and just. Decide which data to keep, and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.830
which to throw away. And so if this giant

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.740
list is the input this smaller list, this

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.090
subset of the original data would be the

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.550
output. And there's a lot of ways filtering

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.150
can happen. We can have a simple filter, which

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.160
is basically just a function which returns keep

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.700
or throw away for. Each of these records, and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.580
for the records that get kept. Well, they

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.880
wind up in the output. There's a bloom filter,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.360
which we're actually not going to talk much about, but

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.200
it's worth knowing about, because this is a much more

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.240
efficient probabilistic filter. That comes with some trade-offs and you

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.880
should check out the instructor notes if you want to read

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.580
more. We also have things like sampling. Which is just

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.250
a way to make a smaller data set from a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.420
large data set. By pulling out some sample, maybe the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.970
highest values of a particular field. If we want to pull

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.120
out a representative sample, one that we think matches the characteristics

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.980
of the original data. We can use random sampling. And finally, we can

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.940
use this idea of filtering to find the, I don't know, top

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.830
ten of something, and that's an exercise we're actually going to do. Click.
