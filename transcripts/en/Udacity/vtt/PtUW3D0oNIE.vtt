00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.220
Okay, let's look at the solution for our

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.540
data dependencies quiz. We have these four instructions.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.020
And for each type of dependence, we need

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.740
to figure whether these pairs of instructions have these

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.520
dependencies. Let's start I1 to I3. We already

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.950
know that there is no read off the

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.975
write dependence. That is because I3 doesn't use

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:25.139
the R1 value produced by the I1. Right after

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:30.023
read, would mean that I3's writing a result into a

00:00:30.023 --> 00:00:35.129
register that was supposed to be read by I1 which is not

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.600
true. Write after write would mean that I3 is overwriting

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.658
the result by I1 and that is true. Now let's go from I1

00:00:45.658 --> 00:00:50.560
to I4. I1 is producing R1. I4 is reading

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.285
R1, but the value that I4 is supposed to read here,

00:00:55.285 --> 00:01:00.740
is not the one produced by I1. It is the value produced by I3.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.490
So in fact, there is no raw dependence from I1 to I4.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.284
That would occur only if I4 was reading R1 that was produced

00:01:11.284 --> 00:01:15.630
by I1, which is not happening. Is there a right

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.518
after independence? Is I4 over-writing R4 that was supposed to be

00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:27.766
read by I1? No, because I1 is not reading R4. Finally, is there a write

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:34.500
after write dependence? No, for two reasons. One is that I4 is writing

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.320
to a different register than I1, so there cannot be an output dependence.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.854
Another reason is that even if I4 was writing

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:47.667
to R1 that would be an output dependence between

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:53.060
I3 and I4. So there would be an output dependence from I1 to I3 and then from I3

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.720
to I4, but because the right is happening to

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.170
R4 and here to R1, certainly there is no

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.280
write after write dependence. Finally, let us look at

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.910
I2 to I3. Is there a read after write dependence?

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.955
Is I2 producing a register that is read by I3? No, it is not. Write

00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:20.007
after read would mean that I3 is overwriting a register that I2 needed to read,

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:26.550
and that is true, because I2 needs to read R1 before I3 overwrites it.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.210
So we have a write after read dependence. And finally, we do not have a write

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.790
after write because there are different registers for

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.050
writing. So this is, again, not selected. So

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.940
the only check marks you were supposed to put in are this one and this one.
