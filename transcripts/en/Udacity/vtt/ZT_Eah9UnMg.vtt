00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.352
Now, we've looked at the overall shape of a graph, talking about what happens

00:00:03.352 --> 00:00:07.525
at either end of it. So now we're going to focus back in again on the middle,

00:00:07.525 --> 00:00:11.776
mainly on the x-intercepts. So here's a graph that you are definitely familiar

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:14.940
with, the graph of a parabola. You know three different ways to write the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.432
equation of a parabola. But the one we're going to focus on today is its

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:23.518
factored form. The function we're concerned with is f of x equals the quantity,

00:00:23.518 --> 00:00:28.232
x minus 5 times the quantity x plus 3. Just to make sure we're on the same

00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:31.221
page, what are the x-coordinates of the x- intercepts of the graph of this

00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:34.699
function? Please fill them in here.
