00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.710
What do you think they would
generalize or specialize?

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.290
&gt;&gt; So we said earlier that whenever
we get a positive example then we

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.590
generalize our most specific model.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.180
So we need to generalize this
model based on this new example.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.535
It's no longer sufficient to say I'm
just allergic to any breakfast at Kim's

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.620
and I find that it's cheap and
not vegan.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.500
There's something else I'm allergic to.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.180
&gt;&gt; That's right, David.
