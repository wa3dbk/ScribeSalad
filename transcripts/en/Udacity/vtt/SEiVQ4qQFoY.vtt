00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.650
So could you give me an example
of bad measurements?

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.860
I mean, again and again,
you see people look at the wrong thing,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.750
and I think the most common thing
is when people look at users and

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.830
they don't measure the number
of users properly.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.410
Now, that's true in a company that
should be generating a revenue

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.120
as looking at the number of users,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.400
rather than how much revenue
those users are generating.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.480
That happens a lot.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.570
But, it's also true even with companies
that should just be looking at users,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.420
when they count users wrong.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.340
They'll say,
we had 50,000 sign ups in the last week.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.620
Okay, a sign up is not a user.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.170
How frequently are those users
engaging with your product?

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.050
&gt;&gt; So looking at patterns of retention.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.000
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
I mean,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.320
retention's everything when
you're looking at users.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.940
If you have people that sign up on
day 1 and they never come back,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.590
it looks terrible, and
it means you're building a bad product.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.370
Something, again that's a mile-wide,
inch-deep kind of thing,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.960
because no one really needs it.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.460
If you have something where
you only have 1,000 users, but

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.740
they use it ten times a day,
now you're on to something.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.160
It might not feel as good as having
50,000 sign-ups, but it's so

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.610
much better because it's
the base that you can grow from.
