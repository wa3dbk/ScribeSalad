00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We've done turning our request IP into some coordinates--ta-da!

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
All right. The next step is to draw a map--actually, there are some in between steps.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Before we draw a map let's look at our code again. We actually have two to-do lists.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We said we're going to look up the users coordinates from their IP.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's go ahead and do that here-- coords = get<u>coords(self.request.remote</u>addr).

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay. That should work.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Then we said if we have coordinates, add them to the art.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Right now our art object doesn't take any coordinates.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's add an extra property to our art--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
coords = db.GeoPtProperty( ).

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Again, I found that this existed when I was reading the Google Data Store docs.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Since we're returning a Geo Point here, we can store it in a Geo Point Property.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Again, this is a Google-specific datatype for storing latitude and longitude, and it's super convenient.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, I'd like to say required = True, but we already have some art in our database

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that doesn't have coordinates. We have a couple options here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We could either delete all that art and start over,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but being that ASCII Chan is a famous site on the internet, and everybody is using it,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we don't want it to just break. We'll just make this parameter not required.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We'll just have it for future ones.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is something that comes up all the time when you're developing web applications.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's kind of backwards compatibility, because you're often adding features,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
tweaking your data model. This is one of the reasons things can get a little hairy.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But it's also one of the reasons why the web is really neat,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because you can kind of develop iteratively.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We're adding our coords to our art, and we're going to go down here and say,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
if we have coordinates, add them to the art.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
That's easy--if coords--basically, if get_coords doesn't return None--

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
p.coords = coords. Now we're good.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Let's go ahead and try submitting some art in our browser and see if we get an exception.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Reload this. Let's submit a new picture, call this one "cat," enter in a picture of a cat,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and we'll submit this. Okay, I didn't see any exceptions.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Let' me show you something handy we can do in Google App Engine

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to make sure this actually submitted properly.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You may notice that when you start up App Engine, it actually mentions in the console

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that the admin console is available at this URL or at a URL like this.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Let's go ahead and visit that and let me show you something we can do.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It defaults to the datastore viewer, and it selects all of the entity kinds we have.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We only have one in this drop down.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
If I click list entries, I can see all of my entries,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and I can see here is camel and here is cat--my two entries.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I can see that camel doesn't have any coordinates,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
because we entered that before we added this feature,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and we can see our cat has map coordinates.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So our feature is working, and that's pretty cool.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
There's all sorts of handy stuff in this tool here.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You can check out your indices and all sorts of cool stuff. It's neat to poke around in here.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
But, working with the database, this is a particularly handy view.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So let's get out of here for now, and let's move on to the next feature,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.968
which is actually drawing this map.
