00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
Now it's time for you to meet Carol, and as I mentioned at the beginning of this course,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.060
Carol is working in finance and her job is to design algorithms

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.570
that will optimize financial investments.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.290
Given recent market turmoils,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.580
her employer has asked her to come up with an algorithm

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.610
that will help them design a secure portfolio of investments.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.340
The problem that Carol is looking at is actually quite similar to the one that Bob is looking at.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.960
She is looking at a number of investment opportunities for her company,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.360
for example, she could invest in precious metals such as gold, silver, or maybe even copper.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.100
She could also invest in stocks.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.690
So, for example, a copper mining company or in a silver and copper mining company

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.050
or she could invest in an industrial manufacturer or also in some other bank.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.790
In order for the portfolio to be secured, she wants to spread her risk as much as possible.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.540
She does not want to invest in things that are too similar or too closely connected.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.620
For example, she wants to invest either in gold or in silver,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.350
but this line here basically tells us that she does not want to invest in both at the same time,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.750
and so she basically only wants to invest in one of those precious metal.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.660
If she invest in copper, she probably does not want to invest in the mining company

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.250
because none of the copper price goes down so will the stock up the copper mining company.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.870
Similar here, this is a silver and copper mining,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.550
so either invest in this company or in those precious metals here.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.930
If the industrial manufacturer is actually a supplier to this company here,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.020
you probably wouldn't want to invest in both of them at the same

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.890
and let's say that the bank down here is backing the two mining company,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.640
so you either invest in the bank or maybe also these two mining company separately

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.360
but you definitely would not want to--well, actually let's just say you also didn't want to invest

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.230
in two mining companies at the same time.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.690
In order to spread the risk as much as possible,

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.010
Carol, of course, wants to find a portfolio that contains as many different items as possible

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.550
because then she has spread out her risk,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.020
but at the same time, she must observe those rule.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.460
She cannot just select all of these possibilities

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.200
but only possibilities that are not connected to each other.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.410
The way that is very similar to Bob's problem because Bob,

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.060
when he was looking at the genes, he was looking for genes

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.080
where every gene is connected to every other gene,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.050
and now Carol is looking for possible investments that are not connected at all to each other.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.210
What is the largest portfolio

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.350
or how many items can Carol select at maximum so none of them are connected?

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.180
I would like you to figure that out as our next quiz

00:02:56.180 --> 99:59:59.999
and I would like you to put your answer here in this box please.
