00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.273
That was bad. It shouldn't have skipped from here back up to the next letter.

00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:07.933
The o in Hello is the beginning of a new vowel group, but the program didn't

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:13.650
count it that way. It looks like it didn't run these lines, because inside

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.020
vowel group is already true. But that's a mistake. Inside vowel groups should

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.618
be false, because the letter before o was l, which is a consonant. How would

00:00:24.618 --> 00:00:29.030
you fix that? I'll make a few suggestions and you can pick the one you think

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.044
will work and implement it. Should we remove the condition, if not inside vowel

00:00:34.044 --> 00:00:39.356
group, so that we always increment counts for vowels. We could change the

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:43.572
condition of the inner if block from not inside vowel group to count equals

00:00:43.572 --> 00:00:50.424
equals 1. We could set inside vowel group to false right after count plus plus

00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:57.190
or set inside vowel group to false when letter is not a vowel.
