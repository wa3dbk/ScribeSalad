00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.390
While each chart type might be slightly better for

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.180
slight differences in your data, and

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.250
what you're trying to communicate, in practice you can get by with only a few.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.380
In navigating this jungle, I like to often start from first principles.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.720
Chart types are simply a set of visual encodings applied to data types, and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.200
combined with some relationship between those data.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.290
For example, a scatterplot is an x coordinate and y coordinate with a shape,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.820
in this case a circle as applied to two continuous variables,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.810
continuous being their data type, in which the y value is dependent on

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.250
the x value, which corresponds to the relationship between them.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.930
And combining all three of these things.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.190
You get the chart type of a scatter plot.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.540
As you can imagine, there are quite a few combinations of these three sets.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.420
A set of the Visual Encodings possible, a set of Data Types possible,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.400
a set of Relationships between your data types.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.210
I think this flow chart does a fairly good job of categorizing the different

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.990
chart types by utility.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.520
But I'll also add that I think a few are missing.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.690
And I do have a few qualms about how Andrew chooses his branches about which

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.120
chart to use given which situation.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.110
When choosing a chart type, I usually either start with the type and

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.780
dimension of my data, or

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.700
what relationships I'm trying to convey between my different columns.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.110
For example, I might ask myself, how many dimensions do I have?

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.190
One dimension, two dimension, three dimensions.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.570
And what type is each?

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.140
Continuous, categorical.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.110
Am I trying to compare two variables,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.150
am I trying to show how one variable is distributed?

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.390
Let's take that last question as a starting point.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.370
Let's say I have one dimensional data that I'm

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.480
trying to see the distribution of.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.360
I would use either a histogram for

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.450
continuous data, and I might possibly want to bin it.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.660
Or a bar chart for categorical data, if I might have

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.770
some discrete values along the x axis that don't have any intrinsic order.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.740
If I want to show a comparison of distributions, I'll use either a box plot, or

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.520
small multiples.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.250
As they represent distributions of multiple variables,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.310
side by side with each other.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.128
We'll get into what each of these looks like in just a second.

00:02:13.128 --> 00:02:16.320
But I want to mention them as you were talking about chart types to

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.440
represent distributions of data types and variables.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.800
To represent a correlation between two variables where the y variable is

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.260
dependent on the x variable, a scatter plot is the most effective way and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.300
the most commonly known.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.880
A scatter plot can be generalized to a bubble chart [INAUDIBLE] Additional

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.410
dimension in visual encoding to represent, in this case the bubble chart

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.220
uses size of each of it's circles to represent a third variable.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.590
A subtlety of the scatter plot, that the x variable is usually assumed to

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.270
be independent and uncorrelated with the other x values.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.130
What does this mean exactly?

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.650
Well let's consider time series data.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.140
When dealing with time, every data point is implicitly dependant on all

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.690
the data points that came earlier in time before it.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.250
In this situation.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.550
We want to use a line chart or

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.500
a multiple line chart to represent time series data.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.640
That one has intrinsic order.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.460
And two has data points that are dependent on what came before them.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.540
With line charts the fact that every point is connected.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.040
Shows a trend in your data and

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.160
implies that every data point does have this inherent connection between them.
