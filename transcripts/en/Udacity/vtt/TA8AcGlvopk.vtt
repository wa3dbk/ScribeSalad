00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.000
So, now let's look at what methods
we can come up that actually makes

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.070
our future detection invariant to scale.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.430
Let's take the same examples
of these two shapes.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.120
Again, you can tell that they
are the same, just scaled up.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.840
And of course,
I kind of look at this window.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.890
It basically says that this is an edge.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.660
Of course, when I look at this window,
it comes across as a corner.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.690
So one thing I can do now is start
looking at different regions.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.790
So, basically,
consider this region a circle, and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.610
they start looking at different
sizes around the same point.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.830
So, in essence,
what I'm doing now is I'm zooming out.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.580
I'm kind of wanting to look at
the same region but from farther away,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.790
which actually would start making
this object start smaller.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.220
So I try out another region, a circle.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.230
Well no, that doesn't work.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.260
Let me try out, at the same point,
another larger one.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.460
And if I keep going and let's say I
get to this scale, all of a sudden,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.000
this detector is going to
fire this to be a point.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.780
That's a corner, just like this.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.072
So in essence,
by scaling up my detector regions,

00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:04.590
I can actually accomplish exactly
what this one is doing and in essence

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.590
what that comes out to is now I would
actually have scaling variant matching.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.700
So, in this basic idea here is the
region of corresponding sizes will look

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.300
the same in both images, as long
as I can come up with that scale.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.415
So this does require a little bit of,

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:23.646
kind of coming up with the process that
let's me find the right size of the new

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:26.870
region that would let me
compare this scale to this one.
