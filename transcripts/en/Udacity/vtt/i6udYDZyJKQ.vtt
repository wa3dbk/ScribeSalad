If you go for this defense where
you use languages that are safe,

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.640
obviously buffer overflow
becomes impossible because of

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.160
all the checks the language is going
to do, so we set bounds checks.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.440
So the checks have to be done at
run time rather than you doing that

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.410
explicitly in the code that you write,
that language is doing for you.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.540
So, why don't we use these kind
of languages for everything?

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.990
Well more and more we're doing that but

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.270
one draw back with these kind
of languages typically is that,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.810
that's going to be either
some sort of performance

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.980
degradation because we just talked
about the checks that had to be done.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.640
And they force you to do certain
things in a certain way.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.240
So flexibility that generally you have
you have with low level programming

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.250
languages goes away.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.640
So if you're looking for really
performance or all the flexibility in

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.550
the world, maybe that's why you don't
use these languages that do this work

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.160
for you to make the buffer
overflow kind of problems go away.
