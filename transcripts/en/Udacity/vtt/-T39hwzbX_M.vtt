00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.680
The key optimal substructure for
the sequence alignment problem

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.188
comes from aligning prefixes of
the sequence that we want to align.

00:00:07.188 --> 00:00:11.870
We define c(i,j) to be the minimum cost
of a aligning the first i characters

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.240
of x with the first j characters of y.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.640
Since x has m characters total, and
y has n characters, our overall

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.350
goal then is to compute c(m,n) and
the alignment that achieves it.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.240
Let's consider this problem of
computing c(m,n), and in particular,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.520
we'll consider what we do with
the last characters of each sequence.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.690
There are three cases to consider.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.540
First suppose that we match
the last two characters of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.530
the sequence together like so.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.330
Then the cost would be the minimum
cost of aligning the first

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.740
m minus 1 character to the x with
the first n minus 1 characters of y,

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.784
plus the cost associated with
matching these two characters.

00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:59.284
Another possibility is that we leave
the last character of the x sequence

00:00:59.284 --> 00:01:00.105
unmatched.

00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:05.367
Then the cost would be the minimum
cost of aligning the first m

00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:10.627
minus one characters of x,
with the first n characters of y,

00:01:10.627 --> 00:01:14.290
plus one for leaving Xm unmatched.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.076
In the case where we leave
Yn unmatched is analogous.

00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:23.430
Of course c(m,n) is defined to be the
minimum cost of aligning the sequences,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.140
so it must be the minimum of
these three possibilities.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.790
Notice, however,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.240
that there was nothing special about the
fact that we were using m and n here.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.610
And the same argument applies
to all combination of i and j.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.530
The problems are similar.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.390
So we can replace m and
n with i and j like so.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.250
Adding the base cases where
the cost of aligning a sequence

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.250
with the empty sequence is just
the length of the sequence.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.340
We have a recursive formulation.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.810
The optimal solution,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.020
expressed in terms of optimal
solutions to similar subproblems.
