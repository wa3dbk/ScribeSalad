00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is definitely the first two, maybe the third.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In the first case, TrustyKeys generated Key AB.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That's the key used to protect these messages,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so any message over this channel that TrustyKeys can intercept it can read.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
TrustyKeys can impersonate any customer because it has a key shared with them.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It can generate a fake channel, make it seem like Alice is talking to Colleen

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but pretend to be Colleen in that communication.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And finally, if there's a malicious party C,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
well, maybe they could tamper with messages along these channels.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I didn't provide enough details on what we're using for encryption here

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and what mode of operation is used and other details

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to know whether or not that's possible.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Let's assume we could solve this problem.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
These other two are really big problems, and there's no way to solve these

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
if we're using a third party to generate our keys.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We also haven't solved the key distribution problem

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
because we still needed to set up all these shared secret keys

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
between TrustyKeys and every other party.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We haven't really solved our problem.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This would only work if everyone completely trusted TrustyKeys,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which seems unlikely, even with the green box,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and if there was a secure way for everyone to establish

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
a shared secret key with TrustyKeys.
