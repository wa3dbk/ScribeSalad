00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.650
Rather than providing an input variable as a name for

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.140
that argument, we can use the parameter this.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.740
It's very important to observe that there's exactly one of

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.650
these move functions in existence.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.640
And it is being pointed to by the move property of multiple different cars in

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.230
addition to the global variable.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.410
So what object do you expect the parameter this in the move function to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.740
be bound to when this last line of code is executed?
