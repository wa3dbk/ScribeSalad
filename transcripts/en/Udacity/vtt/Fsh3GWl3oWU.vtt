00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.280
Let's write down some pseudocode for
a sequential BFS algorithm.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.240
This algorithm will take as input
a graph G represented by its vertices

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.050
and edges.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.340
As well as a source vertex S.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.690
What it will produce is
a map of distances D

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.570
where D of a vertex X is
the distance from S to X.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.290
Now initially,
we don't know any of the distances.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.450
So we'll initialize D to be infinity for
all vertices except S.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.240
S is just zero edges away from itself.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.500
Notice that according to this
initialization convention,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.090
if there is no path from S to X,
then we'll get an infinity at D of X.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.980
Now the algorithm will also maintain
a Q F of unvisited vertices.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.850
Initially, F just contains the source s.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.700
Now as long as F is not empty,
the algorithm does the following.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.180
It first extracts an unvisited vertex v.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.790
It then loops over all of v's neighbors.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.170
Let's call a given neighbor w.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.180
If w does not have a distance yet,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.269
meaning its distance is set to infinity,
then, we will update it's distance to be

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.390
the distance of v plus one since
w is just one edge away from v.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.010
In addition, if it didn't have
a distance yet, then it wasn't visited.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.290
Therefore, we should throw
w into the visited queue.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.490
In this example, I have given
this vertex a label of a and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.460
I have thrown it into f.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.940
Now let's consider the next
neighbor of the current vertex V.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.800
It's also unvisited.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.230
So we repeat this process of updating
its distance and adding it to F.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.010
Now would be a good time for
you to pause and continue to trace

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.210
the algorithm, to see how it works and
convince yourself that it's correct.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.990
Now what is the cost of this algorithm?

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.040
Since you traced it's execution as I
suggested, then you observe that it only

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.010
inserts a vertex into F if
it has not yet been visited.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.370
Therefore the number of iterations of
the while loop shouldn't be more than

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.370
the number of vertices or the size of V.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.350
And since each vertex appears in F at
most once, we'll visit each edge at most

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.930
once if the graph is directed, or
twice if the graph is undirected.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.590
That means that the body of
the innermost for loop will be executed

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.420
a total number of times that is at
most big O of the number of edges.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.250
In other words,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.460
the total cost of the algorithm is big
O of the size of v plus the size of E.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.630
Again, if you trace through the
algorithm yourself on a sample graph,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.920
you'll see how this happens.
