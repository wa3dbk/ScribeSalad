00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.140
Now, let's take a look at our mocks and
think about which

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.040
places we expect users to be able
to interact with on each screen.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.270
This is vital to the next step, where
we actually build out our prototype.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.810
So, for each of the mocks you see here,

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.810
how many attraction points are there for
that mock.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.430
In this case,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.490
we're interested in interaction points
that bring the user to a new screen.
