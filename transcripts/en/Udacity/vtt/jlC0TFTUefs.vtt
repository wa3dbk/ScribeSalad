Before we close, let's recap
really quick how Dyna-Q works.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.560
So, we start with straight,
regular Q-Learning here and

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.280
then we add three new components.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.790
The three components are,
we update models of T and

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.190
R, then we hallucinate an experience.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.480
And update our Q table.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.960
Now we may repeat this many times,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.240
in fact maybe hundreds of times,
until we're happy.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.590
Usually, it's 1 or 200 here.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.550
Once we've completed those,
we then return back up to the top and

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.408
continue our interaction
with the real world.

00:00:38.408 --> 00:00:44.120
The reason Dyna-Q is useful is that
These experiences with the real

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.770
world are potentially very expensive and
these hallucinations can be very cheap.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.300
And when we iterate doing many of them,
we update our Q table much more quickly.
