00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The next is channels. How does your product over here get to your customers over here?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We use distribution channels to do that.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now what's really interesting is pre-1990s,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the only channels to get to a customer was at physical channel.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That is you went to a store, you have sales people, there was physical distribution,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but since the mid 1990s in the last couple of decades, we now have virtual channels.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The web, mobile, cloud and so at distribution channel, the first question you want to ask is,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
how will I be selling and how will I be distributing my products.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Are they through physical channels or the web mobile or given today

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
almost every physical channel also has web presence.

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What is the relationship of how your product gets from your company to the customers?
