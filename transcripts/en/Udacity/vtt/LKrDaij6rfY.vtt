00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:04.022
2. Now for each node in the frontier, how many neighbors does it have?

00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:06.310
This is slightly more complex but still straightforward.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.183
You only need the array R.

00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:10.347
How do you compute the number of neighbors per vertex

00:00:10.347 --> 00:00:13.076
using array R and vertex number V?
