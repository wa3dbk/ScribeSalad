00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.227
Using each side here as the exponent of 10 to some power. We end up with 5x

00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:12.790
times x minus 1 on the left and 10 squared on the right. That means that our

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.317
equations is actually 5x squared minus 5x equals 100. Subtracting 100 from both

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:24.160
sides gives us, 5x squared minus 5x minus 100 equals 0. I notice however,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.378
there's a common factor of 5 in all the terms on the left-hand side. So let's

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:36.082
divide it out. That leaves us with x squared minus x minus 20 equals 0.
