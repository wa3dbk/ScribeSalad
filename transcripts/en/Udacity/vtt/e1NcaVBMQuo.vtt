00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.469
So given that there are N processors participating

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.570
in a barrier algorithm, particularly dissemination barrier algorithm, how

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.460
many rounds do you think the dissemination barrier

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.030
algorithm needs to complete in order to know that

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.430
the barrier is done? So how many rounds

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.035
for the barrier completion? So the choices I'm giving

00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:25.950
you: it's N log N, a log N to the base 2, Or feeling of log and

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.080
base, to the base 2, or N where N is of course a

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.009
number of processors that are participating in

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.100
this barrier. A hint for you [LAUGH]

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.280
I told you already that N in a dissemination barrier need not be a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.500
power of 2. So that's a hint for you to, to answer this question.
