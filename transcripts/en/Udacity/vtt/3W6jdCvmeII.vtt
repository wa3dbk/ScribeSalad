00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.440
So this allows us to
now do the computation.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.240
And now let's look at few curves.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.250
Now here I'm just going to show you some
curves from a different set of images,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.200
not these, but
just this is just to prove a point.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.610
Here basically you see the four curves.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.309
This one is for green.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.570
This is for red.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.340
For blue and, and
then all three of them combined to rgb.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.510
This is to point out that we can
actually do this analysis separately for

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.420
all of the different channels and
then combine it separately.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.590
Again just showing you six images.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.230
Number of images increases,
we can actually do this.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.510
Most of the time for simple,
smaller hand-held cameras.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.500
They only take about two or
three images.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.810
Higher end cameras and
using functions like bracketing

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.520
you can actually capture
a lot more of these images.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.400
So that basically is the capital
P in my previous equation
