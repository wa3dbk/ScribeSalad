00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.620
Our first lesson is not on one
algorithm in particular, but

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.620
on a design technique called,
dynamic programming.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.070
This belongs in the same mental
category as divide and conquer.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.710
It's not an algorithm in itself,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.470
because it doesn't provide
fixed steps to follow.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.760
Rather, it's a general strategy for

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.890
thinking about problems, that often
produces an efficient algorithm.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.740
The term dynamic programming,
by the way, is not very descriptive.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.908
The word programming is used
in an older sense of the word,

00:00:26.908 --> 00:00:28.859
that refers to any tabular method.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.525
And the word dynamic, apparently,

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:33.680
was just used to make
the technique sound exciting.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.220
With those apologies for the name,
let's dive into the content.
