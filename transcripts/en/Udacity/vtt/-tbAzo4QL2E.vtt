00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.120
Trying to figure out how certain traits are inherited can

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.170
be really difficult. Sometimes we have a trait like one

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.620
of our parents or the other, and other times we

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.910
may have a trait not like our parents at all.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.170
Take these three examples of families with different traits. For

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.140
example, look at height in the first scenario. We have

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.900
two parents who are relatively short. Will have a son

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.650
that's taller than both of them. Much taller, in fact.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.730
We have a family where the parents have a daughter

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.370
and a little baby. And they all share the same

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.950
skin color, roughly speaking. And in this third family, we

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.220
have one parent who has a disposition of being happy

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.620
all the time. And the other parent has a disposition

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.540
of being sad all the time. Both the daughter and

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.110
the son have a disposition of being happy. What I

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.990
want you to tell me, is does the indicated trait appear

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.730
related to one or both of the parents at all? For

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.390
example, in the case of height, I want you to compare the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.820
son to the parents. And see if it appears that in some

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.880
form or fashion whether it's a combination of the parents or one

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.550
of the parents sharing this trait, does the son appear related with

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.520
regards to this particular trait of height. And the same thing in

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.370
the scenario with skin color and the same thing with the scenario

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.210
we set up for disposition. Go ahead and tell me which answer

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.800
you think is best for each case.
