00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.889
As the sample size increases, we have a more accurate representation of our

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:10.423
population parameters. In general, we want bigger samples. And since the

00:00:10.423 --> 00:00:16.654
standard error tells us the interval in which the population mean is most likely

00:00:16.654 --> 00:00:21.950
going to lie, the standard error decreases. It's okay if this is somewhat

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.930
confusing right now. I promise that you're going to get it. So, as n gets

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.279
bigger, the entire denominator gets bigger, and then the quotient gets smaller.
