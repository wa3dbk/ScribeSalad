00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.740
Someone poses a question to you. What percentage of

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.830
the guest operating system code may need modification with

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.720
para virtualization? I just want you to give a

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.710
guesstimate as to what you think may be needed

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.310
in order to make a guest operating system run

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.324
on top of a hypervisor in a para virtualized

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:22.990
environment. You think 10% of the code base has

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.570
to be changed, 50% of the code base has

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.340
to be changed, 30% of the code base of the native

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.713
operating system has to be changed, or is it less than 2%?
