00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.744
So let's do another Iron Law performance quiz,

00:00:02.744 --> 00:00:05.999
this time with unequal cycles per instruction. The

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:09.284
program has 50 billion instructions, out of which

00:00:09.284 --> 00:00:12.642
ten billion are branch instructions for which we spent

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:16.059
four cycles per instruction. 15 billion are loads

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.190
for which we spent two cycles per instruction.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.230
5 billion are store instructions for which the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.346
CPI is three and the remaining instruction in the

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:29.810
program are integer adds for which the CPI is one. We do one of those per

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.640
cycle. We clock this processor at four gigahertz.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.530
So the execution time is how many seconds?
