00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:01.830
The by command is going to allow us to answer this

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.736
question. So first I'm going to create an r block of code

00:00:04.736 --> 00:00:08.090
and I'm going to use the by command. I'll pass a www_likes

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.740
as the first parameter and then I'll pass gender as the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.085
second, since that's the variable I would have split our

00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:16.820
www_likes over. I want to total of likes for each gender, so

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.995
I'm going to use the sum function here. Writing this code we

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:25.819
can see our output. The likes for males is at 1430175.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.590
But it's the females that have way more likes. There

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.222
are over three and a half million. It looks like

00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:34.458
females have more than two times the number of likes

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:38.350
as men. And while this might seem trivial, information like this

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.430
can help websites or other businesses decide which features are

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.710
used most often by different subgroups. This might help a

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.330
business or a website decide which feature they should continue

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.910
to invest in, or which ones they should just leave behind.
