00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.812
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The absolute value of 14 plus 7 measures the distance between 14 and negative

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:09.398
7. Notice that in the example of the distance between negative 12 and 5, we

00:00:09.398 --> 00:00:14.251
could find this two ways. So we either have negative 12 minus 5, or if we go the

00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:18.677
other way, we have 5 minus negative 12. 14 plus 7 is the same as 14 minus

00:00:18.677 --> 00:00:23.308
negative 7. So the other way that we could write this distance will be by

00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:28.311
starting with negative 7 and then subtracting 14. Of course both of these gives

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:31.202
the distance of 21, between 14 and negative 7.
