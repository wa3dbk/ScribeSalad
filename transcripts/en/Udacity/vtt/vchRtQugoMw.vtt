00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.673
Okay, so based on these answers, I know that 1 half is equal to 2 4ths. I also

00:00:04.685 --> 00:00:09.074
know that one half is equal to 3 6th. So how exactly did I do that? How did I

00:00:09.086 --> 00:00:13.926
change this into this? Well, if I look at this shape and this one, I notice that

00:00:13.938 --> 00:00:18.567
I just doubled the number of pieces that are in this shape. And I doubled the

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:23.274
number of pieces that I have shaded. So I doubled both. The numerator and the

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:28.738
denominator, and I got 1 times 2 which is 2 and 2 times 2 which is 4 or 2 4ths.

00:00:28.838 --> 00:00:33.560
Now let's look between the one half and the 3 6ths. This time I took my shaded

00:00:33.572 --> 00:00:39.264
pieces and I tripled them, so I multiplied them by 3. I also took the total

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:44.003
number of pieces, I had 2. And now I have a total number of pieces of 6. So I

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:48.884
also tripled my number of pieces. 1 times 3 is 3. And 2 times 3 is 6. But let's

00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:53.669
think about why we can do this. I know 2 divided by 2 is really just 1. So I'm

00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:57.652
just multiplying one half by a form of 1. I'm not changing the value one half.

00:00:57.986 --> 00:01:03.220
I'm just changing what the fraction looks like. The same is true down here. I'm

00:01:03.232 --> 00:01:07.796
taking one half and multiplying it by a different form of 1. And I'll get 3

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:11.918
6ths. So we know one half is equal to 2 4ths which is equal to 3 6ths. These are

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.854
all equivalent fractions. Okay, but let's look a little bit closer at this 2

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.012
over 2 and 3 over 3.
