00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's not all perfect and easier and improved.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Maybe we could talk about some of kind of the downsides,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the things that are a little more difficult in App Engine

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
as a result of how it's set up and how it's designed.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The happy path is paved with concrete, and it has chains along the side,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and so you really can't leave the happy path.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So that's something you have to keep in mind.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And there are failures from time to time.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
A query can work just fine, and then all of a sudden the next time

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
you make exactly the same call, it doesn't work.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And those are just things that you get in a big, eventually consistent

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
kind of amorphous sort of machine.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And so you have to deal with those, and so you start to a lot of times

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
kind of want to do a looping sort of query

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
where you're willing to do the query 3 times.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And within the 3 times, you'll probably get the result,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and the first one might fail.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You just re-perform the same query before you let your request handler

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
send an error response back to the user,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which is actually kind of a good pattern

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because distributed computing, you're going to encounter failures.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And you need to program defensively for those, like, system sort of failures,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
so being ready to do an issue and a retry and putting that into your normal call stack

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
or your framework, I guess.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's easy to do, but it is something that when you really want your app to start running smoothly.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And those are the sorts of things Udacity is dealing with or learning about now--

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to do the retries on things like queries.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You have to be cognizant of how long a long-running task on a back end is going to take.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You get a limit of--I think it's 10 minutes, which seems like a long time,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
but on a highly virtualized system, you can actually have a 10-minute long-running task.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So you have to be prepared to shut it off early and then be ready to pick it back up

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
with a subsequent request.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
One of the other things, I guess, would be a lot of people,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
when you get a bigger Python system, you want to have C modules pre-compiled,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and you don't get that.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So you kind of forget about those sorts of things.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And then the biggest one, which I know that Google is addressing--

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and they have a beta program, and I'm very hopeful that it happens soon--

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
is better SSL certificate support, especially for the custom domain.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You get SSL on domain.appspot.com,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
but if you point a custom domain to it, you don't get SSL support for that,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
which is a big drawback, and it's something they obviously recognize and they are fixing.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So hopefully in time--please, Google--that will be there.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So one thing that I was skeptical about coming in is the database

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and how much access you have to your own data.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Are there any limitations there that need to be thought about?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Definitely.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
It's something that's probably worthy of a whole unit

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
in a course about going deeper with App Engine.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
There are a few things that you kind of have to come to terms with,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and they're trade-offs. Every life is trade-offs, especially with scaling a website.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And for a lot. You have to put up with things like all queries have a limit of 1000 records.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And that's before paging, which kind of sucks.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So you could potentially pull out a result set that was 1000,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
none of--with just empty records.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And then you have to page to the next one to get the 3 that match

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
depending on how it is that the indexing and your collections or your model is structured.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The backup and restore thing is real awkward.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
There's some backup and restore utilities built in

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
but not if you wanted to just take the data on a nightly basis

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and sync it to a testing kind of QA, sort of, like a Prod-QA sort of version of your app.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
There are some tools out there that basically allow you to export the data as Python code,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and then you could run it and import it into another app.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
But in the back of your head--

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
On the one hand, it's nice to have some transparent costs.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
We can tell you pretty much exactly how much every one of our queries costs, which is great.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
The downside is that when you're doing something like a backup,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
in the back of your mind you're going, "Man, this is costing a lot of money."

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And so it's things you can get around but not as smoothly as just taking a hot backup

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
of your local files on a MySQL database or something like that.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
The other one is that there's no real great data viewer.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
There are times when you're troubleshooting you really don't know what's going on.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You want to just issue some SQL queries or some Mongo queries directly against the data

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
to see what the data looks like.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
There is a data viewer on the dashboard,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
but it's not that great, and it only works with certain kinds of data types,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and you can't really update anything.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So if you really just need to flip some field--the status of something--

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and that way you can keep processing and then you can work on fixing your bug

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and getting it out later that day or tomorrow or whatever,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
you can't do that, which is frustrating.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But on the other hand, it might force you to build some more administrative kind of features

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
that if you can fix things easily with some duct tape,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
you end up kind of not really building a good administrative interface.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So sometimes the only way you can do it is by building an administrative interface.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Okay, yeah. So some of those limitations seem to not be without reason,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
but they are limitations. &gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It was funny when we were talking before this.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Some of the Udacity guys had mentioned that if they were building a website

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
that needed to scale to many, many users, App Engine would be a great choice.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And then I kind of mentioned if I was building a toy website,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
App Engine would be my first go-to so I don't have to deal with any of that crud

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
of installing databases and memcached and app service and frameworks and all that stuff.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Setting up a deploy process, all that. &gt;&gt;Oh yeah.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Deployment--man, that's something we haven't touched on in this or in any of my units

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
is when you start having multiple machines,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
deploying code across multiple machines is something that you have to think about.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And there's different strategies, and the versioning stuff is cool in App Engine.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So I want to thank you for doing this with us. This is really cool.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I've learned a lot from talking to you guys about how App Engine works,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and I hope the students have got some better perspective

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
on whether App Engine is the right choice for them.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Absolutely. Thank you for having me, and thank you for your class.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
We've had really great feedback, and it's been fun having this sort of class. &gt;&gt;Cool.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Glad to hear it. And so that wraps it up for Unit 7, which wraps it up for the whole course.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So thank you, everybody, for participating this far.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
If you made it this far, you are a champion of web applications.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And the only thing left for you is the final, which we'll get to next.
