00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.482
We would need to add 4. If we added 4 then we would get a perfect square. We

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:10.758
also know we can add 4 since 1 times 1 would equal 1 square here. We need 4 of

00:00:10.758 --> 00:00:15.609
these in total to get our perfect square. This trinomial is a perfect square

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:21.088
since we can rewrite it as one. We can rewrite x squared plus 4x plus 4 as the

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:27.256
quantity x plus 2 squared. In my head I'm picturing an actual square that has a

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:32.566
side length of x plus 2, and another side length of x plus 2. This is why it's

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:37.170
a perfect square. I can also see that my trinomial fits my perfect square

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.874
pattern. We have a squared plus 2ab plus b squared. This means that we can

00:00:43.874 --> 00:00:47.850
rewrite a trinomial, as the quantity of a plus b squared.
