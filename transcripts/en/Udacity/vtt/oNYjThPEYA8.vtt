00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.640
Looking at the requirements, and knowing that we have only two

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.630
that we can satisfy for sure, it makes sense to first mark

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.080
as mandatory the ability to withdraw cash, which is the most typical

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.650
use of an ATM machine. We are therefore going to mark this requirement

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.260
with an M, for mandatory. It also makes sense to mark as

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.390
mandatory the fact that the ATM system checks the PIN of the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.480
card being used by the customer, as that's the typical level of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.680
security that the customer would expect,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.760
therefore we're going to mark as mandatory

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.320
also the first requirement here. And of course we

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.930
could also perform biometric verification, but based on our knowledge

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.640
of the domain, it seems like that should be

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.410
an additional verification, rather than the main and only verification

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.170
for the system. We will therefore mark it superfluous.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.720
That is something that we can postpone until a later

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.100
release, the second requirement. Finally,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.740
another typical operation that customers

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.070
perform at ATM machines is depositing. Whereas changing an ATM

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.850
card's PIN is not such a common operation. We'll therefore mark

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.710
it nice to have this fourth requirement and as superfluous, the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.420
last one. So at the end, what we have is that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.540
we have two mandatory requirements which are the two that we can

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.280
satisfy for sure. One, nice to have the requirement, which is

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.960
the possible third requirement which we might have time to satisfy. And

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.980
the other two that are marked as superfluous, as something that

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.100
we might do later, for example in a subsequent release. And of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.060
course there is something subjective in these answers. But

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.020
again, based on our knowledge on our understanding of

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.910
the domain, these are the one that makes more

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.640
sense for an ATM system as we know it.
