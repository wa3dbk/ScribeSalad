00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.586
We're usually content with having a 95% confidence interval, but what if we

00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:11.006
wanted to be more sure that the population mean was within this interval? So,

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:16.855
what if we wanted a 98% confidence interval? So, let's do the same thing we did

00:00:16.855 --> 00:00:22.671
last time. We wanted to first find the z squared values that encompass 98% of

00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:30.226
the data. So, I took out all the 1.96 values here, here, and here. So, how bout

00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:35.761
you write this z score value here? And remember you're trying to fill in the

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:37.091
blank right here.
