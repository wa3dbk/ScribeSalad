00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.826
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So here's the word equation we came up with in the last problem. Clearly

00:00:03.826 --> 00:00:07.922
though, considering I had to write this on two separate lines, there are a lot

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:11.924
of words here and this is going to be kind of confusing to keep track of. So,

00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:15.734
let's use some different variables. I'd like to let x equal the number of

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:19.451
nozzles made and I'd like to let y equal the total amount spent on nozzle

00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:23.472
production. So, with those substitutions, our equation will look a little bit

00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:27.372
cleaner. With these substitutions, it's pretty clear that this equation is

00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:31.392
written in slope intercept form, which we are now very familiar and comfortable

00:00:31.392 --> 00:00:35.327
with. So thinking about where the slope should show up in this equation and the

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:39.922
information that we're given. What number do you think the slope is equal to in

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:40.858
this equation?
