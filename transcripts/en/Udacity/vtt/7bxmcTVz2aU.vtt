00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.175
So going back to this term that we're
looking at earlier 5x times 7y times 2z, we can start

00:00:05.187 --> 00:00:10.300
to use what we just learned about
commutativity to rearrange all the factors

00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:15.100
that are multiplied together here, in
whatever way we want to. Now, what I

00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:20.125
really want in this case is for all the
variables to be on the back end of the

00:00:20.137 --> 00:00:25.525
term and all of the numbers. Are the
constant factors to be at the front of the

00:00:25.537 --> 00:00:31.435
term. So please write in these slots an
equivalent version of this term by filling

00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:36.540
in each slot with either a constant or a
variable. So, we're just going to

00:00:36.552 --> 00:00:42.219
rearrange these terms in an order like
this. Think about what answers are allowed

00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:42.983
because of the commutative property.
