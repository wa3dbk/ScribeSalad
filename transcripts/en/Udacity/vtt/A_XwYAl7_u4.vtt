Frames are typical character of human cognition. Let us consider three

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.720
specific ways. First, frames are a structured knowledge representation.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.500
We can think of production systems as being atoms of knowledge representation,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.100
and frames as being molecules of knowledge representation.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.430
A production rule captures a very small amount of information. A frame can

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.540
capture a large amount of information in organized manner as a packet.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.210
Second, frames enable me to construct a theory of cognitive possessing which is

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.410
not entirely bottom-up, but is partially top-down. I have to see a lot of data

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.720
from the world. But not all of the cognitive processing is bottom-up. The data

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.500
results in the retrieval of information from my memory. That information,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.950
that knowledge in the form of frames then help to make sense of the data.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.820
It has been generating expectations of the world.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.290
So then the processing becomes not just bottom-up, but also top-down. Third,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.910
frames capture the notion of stereotypes. Stereotypes of situations, stereotypes

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.368
of events. Now, stereotypes can sometimes lead us to incorrect inferences. Yet

00:01:11.368 --> 00:01:15.210
you and I have stereotypes of whereas kind of events and situations. So

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.270
why do we have state effects, because they're cognitively efficient. And

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.950
why are they cognitively efficient? Because instead of reasoning about

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.450
the world anew each time, they already have default values associated with them.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.030
That's the property of frame. All the default values then,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.940
enable me to generate certain number of expectations very rapidly.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.580
That's cognitively efficient. Here are three formative connections between

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.570
frames and human cognition. There are a lot more that we'll get into slowly.
