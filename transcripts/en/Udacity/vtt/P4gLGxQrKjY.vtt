00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.915
So, let's redraw this sampling distribution. So, if this is the mean of the

00:00:04.915 --> 00:00:09.137
population which is the same as the mean of the distribution of sample means.

00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:14.873
And let's say this is two standard deviations away from the mean which is the

00:00:14.873 --> 00:00:20.952
same as the mean plus 2 times the standard error. And this value here is the

00:00:20.952 --> 00:00:29.562
mean minus 2 times the standard error. Now, 95% are between these two values.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:36.395
So, getting back to this example, 95% of means are within two of these standard

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:43.328
deviations on either side of the population mean. This distance, 2 times the

00:00:43.328 --> 00:00:48.690
population standard deviation divided by root n, is called the margin of error.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.346
So now, what does that tell us about this value of 40? If everyone started using

00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:58.107
the Bieber Tweeter, we're guessing that there'd be a new population distribution

00:00:58.107 --> 00:01:03.970
of Klout scores, but we don't know what it would be. But we do know that one of

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.528
the samples of size 35 has a mean of 40. Now, if 95% of sample means are within

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:16.528
2 times the standard error, then this mean value has a 95% chance of being

00:01:16.528 --> 00:01:23.128
within 2 times the standard error of this new population mean, if everyone used

00:01:23.128 --> 00:01:24.829
the Bieber Tweeter.
