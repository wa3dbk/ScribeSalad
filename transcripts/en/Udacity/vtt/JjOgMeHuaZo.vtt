Generating HTML from within
Python isn't all that fun.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.290
I am sure you're getting pretty tired
of having to create these strings we've

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.630
called output over and over and over.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.250
This can get pretty cumbersome as our
application gets more and more complex.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.030
Because of that,
Flask configures a template engine for

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.950
you to store your HTML code.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.900
To render a template you can
use this cleverly named method

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.380
called render_template.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.900
All you have to do is provide
the name of the template and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.483
the variables you want to pass to the
template engine as keyword arguments.

00:00:27.483 --> 00:00:29.722
Here I will render a template for
my menu items page.

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:33.300
Flask will look for my templates
in a folder named templates.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.960
So I'll make a directory called
templates in the same folder as my

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.930
Flask application, and from within
it I'll create an HTML document and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.170
call it menu.html.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.200
But what about when we need to get
information from our database or

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.420
Python code into our HTML?

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.660
This retrieval of data
is called HTML escaping.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.100
Templates in Flask are already
pre-configured to handle escape code.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.940
That is, the code that we
are retrieving from our application and

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.460
database, and putting it into our html.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.300
With HTML escaping we have
access to python variables and

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.140
functions, and can even get the results
added directly into our HTML code.
