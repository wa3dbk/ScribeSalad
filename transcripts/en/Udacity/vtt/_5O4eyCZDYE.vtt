00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.802
Let's try another problem. This time, you're going to fill in some of the steps

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:07.437
along the way. I'm going to start this by writing each number in scientific

00:00:07.437 --> 00:00:11.352
notation. Once we have our scientific notation, we can rearrange our terms to

00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:15.246
group the numbers together, and the powers of 10 together. What would be the

00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:17.970
exponent for our power of 10? Enter your answer here.
