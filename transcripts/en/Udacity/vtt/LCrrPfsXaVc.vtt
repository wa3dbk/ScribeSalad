00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.514
Remember that the bin size is the interval in which you're counting the

00:00:04.526 --> 00:00:09.458
frequency. So, in this histogram, the interval is 10, and in this histogram the

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.617
interval is 20. Therefore, this histogram has a smaller bin size.
