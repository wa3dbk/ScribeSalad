00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.939
We have seen a RAW based processor, but this processor has not been

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.250
a superscalar processor. It was only issuing one instruction per cycle, and

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.670
even though we have seen a variant in one of the quizzes that commits up

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.190
to two instructions per cycle, the bottom link will still be the issue.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.090
So now let's look at a real superscalar processor. What does it have to do?

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.790
First, it needs to fetch more than one instruction per cycle. When we

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.320
are really fetching more than one instructions worth of memory per cycle. So

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.840
if the instructions are for example four bites and we want to fetch two,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.970
our fetch really needs to supply us with eight bits every cycle.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.040
Then, we need to decode more than one instruction per cycle.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.930
This amounts to basically having more than one decoder.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.230
So, every cycle the first decoder will be looking at the first instruction,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.200
while the second one will be looking at the second instruction we fetched, etc.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.810
Next, we have to issue more than one instruction per cycle.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.050
Remember that we need to issue instructions in order.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.900
So every cycle, we will consider the next instruction that should issue for

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.630
issuing. And if it can issue, we will also consider the next instruction, and

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.310
if that one can issue, we will consider the next one, and so on.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.540
So for example, if you were trying to issue up to three instructions per cycle,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.520
they still need to be three consecutive instructions, and

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.830
if one of them cannot issue, then the following ones cannot issue either.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.670
We want to be able to dispatch more than one instruction per cycle.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.160
We have seen that if we have more than one execution unit,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.350
we actually can dispatch one instruction to each of the units. Effectively,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.240
we will already able to dispatch more than one instruction per cycle. Now,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.170
the problem usually is that you have many more adds than multiplies for

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.800
example. So if you really want to finish more than one instruction per cycle and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.690
do that over many cycles, probably we would have to have something like two add

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.630
units and a multiplication unit so that even if we have only adds to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.020
do we would be able to issue and dispatch two per cycle on average.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.580
Then we need to be able to broadcast more than one result per cycle.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.420
This involves not having only two broadcast passes or three broadcast passes but

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.800
also every reservation station has to compare it's tags that it's waiting for

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.020
to every one of the passes because in any given cycle we could have any of

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.740
the passes producing a result. So, this immensely complicates the reservation

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.940
station. Basically the cost of each reservation station is

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.830
proportional to the number of broadcasts we have to monitor. If we had one,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.680
let's say that's some cost, having three broadcasting sets is going to be at

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.880
least three times as costly. And finally our commit logic needs to be capable of

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.790
committing more than one instruction per cycle. We have already seen in one

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.360
of our quizzes that this is very similar to issuing in that for committing,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.280
we consider the first instruction that is not committed for commit. It that one

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.250
can't commit, we consider the next one to commit in the same cycle, and so

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.430
on. So, it's not only that we have to consider three instructions for commit and

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.040
check whether they're done, we also have to make sure that we don't commit for

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.860
example, the third instruction we are considering unless both of

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.180
the previous ones are committed. And among these we really have to

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.370
be worried about the weakest link. Meaning if we can fetch up to let's say

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.980
four instructions per cycle, decode up to four instructions per cycle,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.350
issue only one per cycle, dispatch up to four, broadcast up to four,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.740
and commit up to four, we will still be limited by the issue of only one. So on

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.190
average we can never produce more than one instruction finishing per cycle and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.580
committing, because simply they have to go through issue one at a time. If all

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.540
of these are very, very large, and one of them is limited to let's say three,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.590
then again, we will not be able to average more than three instructions per

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.020
cycle, no matter how well the programming is managed in this organization. So,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.420
pretty much this is kind of like a pipe where the width of the pipe in each of

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.730
the stage, is determining the flow of the entire pipe pretty much. The narrowest

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.330
place in the pipe is what limits the flow of the instructions through it.
