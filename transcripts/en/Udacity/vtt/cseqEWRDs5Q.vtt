00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.620
&gt;From this previous lessons and

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.790
courses what you really learned is
the big picture of machine learning.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.450
You learned that machine
learning always starts with data.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.580
It's not like a traditional program
where you build the decision making

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.500
directly into the code.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.990
But with machine learning we always
start with a big amount of incoming data

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.640
and then it produces some decisions,
some ideas,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.690
some summaries about that data.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.930
So in this nano degree program,
we also need to start with the data.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.880
In this first unit on model building and
validation,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.410
we're going to talk about how it can
take in a big quantity of incoming data,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.110
process it and
read some conclusions about it.
