00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Narrator] Here's the answer: we can define a procedure named replace spy.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It takes 1 parameter as its input.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'll call the parameter P.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We could call it spy and that might be a more natural name for it here,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but to avoid confusion with the variable spy, we're using in the example, I'll call it P.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For the body of replace spy what we want to do is change the value

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
in position 2 of the value past it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, we can do that within an assignment statement.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
On the left side we're selecting the cell, and we're replacing it

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
with a value that we get from the old value in that position plus 1.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This has the behavior that we want, and to have a better understanding why

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
let's see what happens when we pass a value to our procedure.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Here's what we had before the call.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We've initialized the variable spy to hold the list

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
containing 3 elements that are numbers 0, 0, 7.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Then we make the call to replace spy, passing in spy.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What happens when we call a procedure the name of the variable in the procedure

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
now refers to the object that's passed in.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, now the value of P of the parameter here refers to that object.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Then we do the assignment.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We replace the value in position 2 of P with it's previous value plus 1,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
so that changes this value to 8.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The parameter P and the variable spy both refer to the same object,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so that also changes the value of spy.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Not that there's no return statement here.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We don't need to return a new value.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We've modified the value of the list that was passed in,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and I want to emphasize that this is different from what's happened in other procedures.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
If you remember in an earlier exercise you defined the procedure INC.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It takes 1 input, we'll call it N, and it adds 1 to that.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If we remove the return statement from INC,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
it doesn't change the value that's passed in.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It does nothing, and here's why:

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
suppose we had code like this, we'll introduce a variable A,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
give it the value 3; we'll call INC on A.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
What happens here--well, the variable A that name refers to the value 3.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
When we passed that to INC--well, the same thing happens

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
as happened when we passed the mutable list as parameter P to replace spy.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The name N now refers to the same value as A referred to,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but we can't mutate that value.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
What happens inside INC is an assignment statement.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We assign to N the value N +1,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
so that the changes the value N refers to.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Now N refers to a value 4, but that doesn't change the value A refers to.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
A still has the value 3.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So, we can see with numbers we can't mutate the value of a number.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If we could everywhere the value 3 existed before--well, now it would mean 4.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
That would be pretty confusing.
