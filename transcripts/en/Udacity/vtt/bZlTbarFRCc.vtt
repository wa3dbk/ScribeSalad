00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.678
So what about biology in aggression? It turns out that overall gender is the

00:00:03.678 --> 00:00:08.226
best predictor of aggression. Men being more likely to commit crimes such as

00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:13.280
murder, battery and assault. Culture may also account for some of this in that

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.111
aggressiveness may be a product of socialization. It appears that many

00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:22.940
societies encourage males to be more aggressive than females. But our biology

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.825
clearly plays a role too. Do you remember when we discussed testosterone in our

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:31.380
less non-motivational emotion? Well, testosterone is a male sex hormone.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.797
However, you'll recall that women also have testosterone and that's important

00:00:34.797 --> 00:00:40.292
for our sexual response. We see that testosterone is related to aggression. In

00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:43.607
that those with higher levels of testosterone correlate positively with the

00:00:43.607 --> 00:00:47.919
tendency towards aggression and violence. Now something else that's important

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:52.234
to aggression is serotonin. It turns out that low levels of serotonin actually

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:57.122
make aggression more likely in humans as well as in other animals. So we see

00:00:57.122 --> 00:01:00.112
that our biology plays a role in aggression and our social influences can play

00:01:00.112 --> 00:01:05.491
a role in aggression. Now, are boys aggressive in the same way as girls? And

00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:09.373
how does the social world influence our aggressive behaviors. We see that boys

00:01:09.373 --> 00:01:14.130
may model other boys or men and imitate aggressive behaviors such as, punching,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.630
kicking and so forth. And then as for girls, we do see that they can be

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.050
physically aggressive. Often times, girls engage in what we call indirect

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.660
aggression. That's not necessarily hitting or punching but engaging in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.306
behaviors that may exclude an individual. For example, girls may be more likely

00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:38.266
to talk badly about a person, spread rumors about a person or make fun of a

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:44.490
person. Or generally just engage in ways to psychologically hurt an individual.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.010
We can argue that the pain of being punched in the face or having rumors spread

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.595
about you can be very similar. Because as we've said a few times, the

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:56.885
experience of physical and psychological pain both activate the same areas of

00:01:56.885 --> 00:02:00.459
the brain. Now, let's go back to Susan
