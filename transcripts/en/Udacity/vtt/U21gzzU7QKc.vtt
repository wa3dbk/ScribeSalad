00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Norvig] Now let's put the whole thing together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I've defined zebra_puzzle. It's a function.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It doesn't take any arguments because there's only 1 puzzle.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There aren't different puzzles that require different arguments.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's going to return a pair of WATER and ZEBRA,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so 2 house numbers indicating which house drinks water and which house owns a zebra.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I've repeated houses = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I've also defined first and middle.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I've repeated the work of figuring out all the orderings. That's constraint #1.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And then I've written the whole function as a generator expression,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and I chose to do that rather than sticking with the nested for loops

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
just because the structure is a little bit easier.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What we're doing here is we're asking for the next version.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So in other words, the first time through we're asking for the very first solution

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to this iterator expression where we say iterating through the 5 properties,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
if each of the tests is true, then return the values of WATER and ZEBRA

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and then keep on doing that for all possibilities.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
But I'm only interested in the very first one, which the next after nothing is the first.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So go ahead and return that.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Each of the constraints is very easy to state.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Englishman is red, the Spaniard is dog, coffee is green and so on.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We have some immediate rights and nextto, and that's the whole problem.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So in some sense we have a solution; in another sense we know that it's going to take

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
something like an hour or 2 to complete.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And maybe we're not happy with that, so we're going to make it faster.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But before I do that, I want to do a little bit of review of these generator expressions

00:01:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
because probably you haven't seen this too much before.
