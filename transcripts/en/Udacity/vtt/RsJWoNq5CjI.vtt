00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.807
Thinking about what we did in the last quiz, if instead we wanted to solve x

00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:07.651
cubed plus 1 divided by x plus 1, and use long division to do it, how should we

00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:13.356
set up the problem? What should we write here under the long division sign and

00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:15.283
what should we write outside?
