00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.340
So now that you know how to support the view

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.160
port meta, let's poke around in the developer tools to

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.910
see what we need to do to fix this page.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.710
Now, the biggest problem here is that the page has

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.900
a fixed column width. If I resize the window, you'll

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.300
notice the column of text doesn't actually change size, just

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.040
margin position. As we mouse around the elements inside the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.810
dev tools, we can pretty quickly find, the first offending element.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.890
This page element here actually has a width set

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.390
on it. Let's disable that and see what happens. Well,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.360
it certainly changed things, but I don't think that

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.050
it actually improved things very much. Let's keep digging inside

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.390
the content and see what we can find. This

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.540
wrapper element has a width of 100% already. Which is

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.630
good. It means that it's not preventing us from

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.020
resizing. But this content element does have a width set

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.000
in pixels. Let's disable that. Now as we resize

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.880
the page our content is fine but the sidebar is

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.060
appearing and disappearing. Sure enough, it has a width set.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.650
If we set its width as a percentage also, now

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.550
we're resizing a little bit better. So now let's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.050
go back up to the page, and let's try giving

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.400
it a width but let's give it a width in

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.370
view port units instead, now our only remaining problem seems

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.280
to be that the header is actually not resizing as

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.900
we want it to let's go take a look at

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.770
the header image again. The image has a max width

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.910
set, but not just a width. So, let's set its width.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.530
And now, everything seems to be resizing well. Now, this isn't perfect,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.570
but all that I really wanted to get at was that as you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.930
try to transition pages from fixed layout to fluid layout, The core

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.710
things to look for, are fixed pixel sizes and lack of percentage resize.
