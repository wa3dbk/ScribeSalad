00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.540
We have seen that the ROB changes when we free the reservation stations. Let's

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.120
see if we understand that. Suppose that we have a situation where an instruction

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.730
cannot issue because there is no available reservation station for

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.960
it. When is this more likely to happen? When we have a processor

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.360
with normal Tomasulo's algorithm, no reorder buffer, and we have 2 add and

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.960
2 multiply reservation stations, or when we have a processor that does have

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.840
a ROB and has the same number of reservation stations.
