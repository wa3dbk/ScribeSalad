If you recall from lesson 2, we discussed that we wanted you to become better

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:09.740
critical thinkers. Where critical consumers of research and information. So

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.573
let's move onto talk about critical thinking. Critical thinking can be defined

00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:19.444
as the process by which we analyze and evaluate the formation of new ideas. So

00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:23.288
this is how we analyze facts, how we organize and generate new ideas, how we

00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:27.132
defend our opinions and thoughts, how we draw inferences, how we evaluate

00:00:27.132 --> 00:00:34.244
arguments, how we make comparisons, and how we solve problems. These are all

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:38.187
examples of critical thinking. So, critical thinking involves analyzing,

00:00:38.187 --> 00:00:42.477
interpreting, evaluating, explaining, making inferences, and engaging in

00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:47.576
self-regulation. If you can learn these skills, you can become a better

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:53.600
critical thinker. In doing so you examine people's claim by analyzing,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.930
evaluating, and drawing conclusions based on the facts and on the evidence.
