00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is, no, it's not possible to include the signature in the hash itself.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The reason for this is if that was included, we don't know what it is until we've computed this.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
After we compute this, well, if we computed it again with the new result,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That would change it every time.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Unless we had a very weak hash function and a very weak encryption function,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
there is no way to sensibly include the signature in these contents,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but the good news is we don't need to.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The reason we don't need to is this is what we're using to verify the rest of the certificate.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The important part is that it's encrypted using the private key of the issuer.
