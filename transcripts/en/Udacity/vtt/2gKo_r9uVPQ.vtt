00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's a way to define find_second.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So we're defining a procedure, giving it the name find_second.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.814
It has 2 inputs.

00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:10.000
One name for the input would be search and target.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The names could be anything you want, but it makes sense to give them names

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that tell us what we're doing.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And then the first thing we need to do is find the first occurrence.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So we're going to use search.find, passing in target to find the first occurrence.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And now we're going to store them in a variable.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
To find the position of the second occurrence we have to do search again,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so we're going to call search.find.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This time we need to have the second input, which is first + 1 to say find the first occurrence

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
after this position.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We'll store that in the variable second, and we'll return second,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and so that was the implementation that was used in the test.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We could make this a little simpler.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.231
One way to make this simpler--we don't need to actually have the variable second.

00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:55.662
We could return second right away, and so now we only have 2 lines,

00:00:55.662 --> 00:01:01.000
and we'll run the same test just to show that it still works.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We could even make it simpler than this.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.185
We don't even really need the variable first.

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:10.000
We could replace first here with the search to find the first occurrence.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.662
Then we don't need the variable first.

00:01:12.662 --> 00:01:14.000
We only need 1 line.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's a good question, which of these is the best?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I think probably the one before this was actually better than this.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is a complicated enough expression that it's hard to read.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We're separating it into the variable first, and then using first here

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
has exactly the same meaning, produces the same result.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
This is a little bit easier to understand what's going on,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
so I think I prefer this version of the procedure.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
But either one certainly is okay, and either one works well.
