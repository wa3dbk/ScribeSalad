00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now comes the tricky part, and I want you to answer it for me.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What is the joint probability that the true location is 2 and Monty chooses to show me 1?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What is the joint probability for the location be 2 and Monty shows me 2?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Two and three, clearly, the true location in this case is 2

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and I've picked 2, so in this specific situation Monty has a chance to choose from

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the two other doors and say he picks them at 50% chance randomly.
