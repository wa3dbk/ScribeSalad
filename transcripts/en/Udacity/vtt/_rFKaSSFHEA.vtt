00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.800
First let's take a look
at the security of iOS.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.310
The iOS security architecture
combines both software and

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.830
hardware features to provide security to
an iOS device such as an iPhone or iPad.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.120
It has built in crypto capabilities
to support data protection,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.830
such as confidentiality and integrity.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.310
For example,
notice that the crypto engine and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.310
the crypto keys are embedded
in the hardware.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.430
And of course, beta protection is
applied to not just the system files but

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.160
also application data.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.100
The security architecture also provides
various strong isolation mechanisms, for

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.260
example, it uses App Sandbox
to protect app security.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.750
This enables the apps to run securely.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.310
For example, apps cannot
interfere with each other and

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.480
also this ensure
the integrity of the system.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.450
That is, even if an app is compromised,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.310
it's damage to the system
is very limited.
