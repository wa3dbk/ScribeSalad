00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.140
Were there any sort of metrics that
you measured that you thought were

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.840
initially important but weren't,
they were really just vanity metrics?

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.183
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
We measured day 1 retention rate pretty

00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:12.567
intensely, and we tried to do everything
right to get the day 1 retention rate,

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:16.628
but we found out that day 1 to day 7
retention rate drop-off was not really

00:00:16.628 --> 00:00:17.850
important.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.400
We found that day 7 to day 14 drop-off
rate was more important than that.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.670
So we just discarded thinking about
day 1 retention rate after some time.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.730
&gt;&gt; And were there any other
metrics that came up or

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.180
that any other thing that you wanted
to dig into more that you weren't

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.600
initially sure whether this was going to
be a good metric for the company?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.760
&gt;&gt; We did not, we always wanted to
find out how many invites were sent,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.255
but we did not know the number of,

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:49.930
we were not really in a position
to differentiate between invites

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.000
sent by a new user as well as invites
sent by an already existing user.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.620
So invites sent by an already existing
user were more critical, more important

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.550
for us, which we did not think they
were important in the beginning.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.504
But later we found out that these two,
instead of invite,

00:01:08.504 --> 00:01:12.130
these two set of user base
was completely different.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.020
They affected differently
on our product.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
