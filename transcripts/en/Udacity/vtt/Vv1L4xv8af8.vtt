00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.150
So let's talk about measurements.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.820
What are the things that
start-ups should measure?

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.160
&gt;&gt; Such an important question.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.795
It's actually the first
conversations we have with

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:12.460
start-ups when they
get into Y Combinator.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.218
The first time we sit down with
them we say, what's your metric,

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:18.626
because Y Combinator runs for
three months.

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:22.020
They get in, it's really four months
from the time they get in, five months

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.960
from the time they get in but,
they have demo day at the end of that,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.970
when they get up in front of a roomful
of very intelligent people, and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.520
they show their progress.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.040
And the more progress they can show,
honestly, the better that demo goes and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.550
the better their follow
up conversations go.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.740
So, you have to figure it out and
it's different for every company.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.150
Now, there are variations on themes,
right?

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.600
There are basic themes
that everyone looks at.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.670
If you're a company that
should be generating revenue,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.380
your metric is probably revenue.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.140
If you're a social product,
it's probably users or

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.810
some function of engagement.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.190
If you are a transaction site, it's
probably something about the number of

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.440
transactions you do or the volume of
transactions, which by the way is

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.620
just a proxy for revenue, because
you probably would take a cut of it.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.640
So it's particular to
different startups.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.460
I think the critical thing is
to make sure it's the thing

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.500
that actually reflects whether or

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.640
not you're succeeding as a business,
and not what we call vanity metrics.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.710
&gt;&gt; And what's the hard part about
setting the metrics and measuring them?

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.650
&gt;&gt; Everything.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.120
Right, so I think on one
level it's hard to choose.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.410
You start out as a company and
you think to yourself, oh,

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.650
there's all these different things
I want to accomplish, right?

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.400
I want to hire people,
I want to raise money.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.670
Raising money, by the way, probably
the biggest vanity metric of all.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.430
Basically meaningless for
the success of your company,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.305
except that it gives you money
to achieve the metrics you need.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.990
So, you think that, you think that,
you want a lot of people,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.170
you want a lot of press,
you want all these things,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.860
and they all feel good, but they don't
necessarily matter to your business.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.400
So that's the first part.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.450
Ignoring all that vanity is hard.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.830
The hardest part, though, is once you
pick a metric, being honest about it and

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.370
sticking to it, and
setting time frames for

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.230
success and for
progress that you actually stick to.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.200
So, we tell companies that during
Y Combinator they should grow

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.240
whatever their metric is between 5 and
10% a week.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.910
We try to say go for 7% a week.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.580
If you do more, great.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.080
If not, not.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.030
And that's great for consumer companies.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.830
And if they're sticking to that,
the thing that happens,

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.690
and this is something
that people miss a lot.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.220
They say, oh,
all you care about is growth.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.470
But, growth isn't
a one-dimensional thing, right?

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.930
Growth is a function of the fact that
you've done everything else properly.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.130
You built a product that people want,
you got it into their hands,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.320
you supported it, it continues to
be something that they want to use.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.140
That's what leads to growth.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.690
So you can't, you can't isolate it.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.040
And if you miss it, that's when it gets
hard, because then you have to be honest

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.730
with yourself about why you missed
that goal, why you missed you metric.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.170
And that will make you
fix your business.
