00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.510
Until now,

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.860
we've given you a demo, but what we're
really interested in is production.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.330
The goal of this course is to
get you ready for scaling and

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.070
managing containers in production.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.630
So, let's do that now.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.370
That's where deployments come in.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.550
See, deployments are a declarative
way to say what goes where.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.690
The used in four state is
given by the end user.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.650
Behind the scenes deployments use
a Copa90's concept called replica sets

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.730
to ensure that the current number
of Pods equals the desired number.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.980
When it comes to managing Pods,
deployment destruct away the low level

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.110
details like what node is my Pod on,
where is it running.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.590
Pods are tied to
the lifetime of the Node.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.010
So, when the Node goes away,
so does the Pod.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.730
Instead of managing that we can
use deployments to make our

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.400
life a little easier.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.890
In the example on screen you'll see
that we have a Pod with one replica.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.090
Well, what happens when we change the
number of replicas from one to three.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.280
Our deployment will go ahead and

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.240
ensure that the number of replicas in
production matches are desired state.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.440
This means that even if a Node goes
down like Node3 just in our example,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.790
the deployment will start a new Pod and
find somewhere to put it for us and

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.340
that's pretty cool.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.870
It's time to combine everything we've
learned so far about Pods and service

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.710
and the breaking up the Monolith App in
a smaller services using deployments.
