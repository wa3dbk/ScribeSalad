00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.194
So if we bring up our handy-dandy z-table, we're looking for 0.005, because

00:00:05.194 --> 00:00:15.138
0.005 times 2 is 0.01. So here's 0.0051 and 0.0049, so z-critical value is

00:00:15.138 --> 00:00:25.408
negative 2.57, or negative 2.58. It doesn't really matter too much, we'll just

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:32.570
say it's about negative 2.57. So if a proportion of 0.005 is less than negative

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:41.772
2.57, a proportion of positive 0.005 is greater than positive 2.57. So our z

00:00:41.772 --> 00:00:47.568
critical values are negative 2.57 and positive 2.57 and we can just shorten

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:51.564
this to plus or minus 2.57.
