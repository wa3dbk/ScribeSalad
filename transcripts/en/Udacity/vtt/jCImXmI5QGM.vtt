00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.969
We've seen how expensive it would be to track all the photons in a scene. To

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.298
avoid this level of computation. In computer graphics, we make a number of

00:00:07.298 --> 00:00:11.538
simplifying assumptions. First, only those photons that reach the camera are the

00:00:11.538 --> 00:00:15.119
ones needed to make the image. So, these are the only ones we would like to

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.100
compute. We know which objects we can see. But how do we know in advance which

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.676
photons will matter? Each photon is generated by a light source, but we don't

00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:26.655
know where each ends up. So, we reverse the process. Instead of sending photons

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:30.750
from the light, we essentially cast a ray from the eye through each pixel and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.805
see what's out there. When a surface is seen at a pixel, we then compute the

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:38.613
direct effect of each light on that surface. Add up all the light contributions

00:00:38.613 --> 00:00:41.979
and you have a reasonable proximation of what the surface looks like. One more

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.855
approximation can be used for these lights, nothing blocks them every surface is

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:49.503
considered visible to a light unless it faces away from that light source, in

00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:53.488
other words no objects casts shadows. This simplification saves us a lot of

00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:57.688
computation. Rendering can get even simpler than this. For example, you could do

00:00:57.688 --> 00:01:01.478
away with lights all together and just draw each object with a solid color.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:05.766
However, I'm drawing the line there as lights add considerable realism and

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:09.736
perception of 3D to a scene. For example, look at this scene with, without

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:14.074
lights. So there are two extremes. At one end photons are carefully traced from

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.670
light emitters through a scene, potentially giving a highly realistic image. At

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.300
the other end the camera determines what gets viewed and a rough approximation

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.624
of what light reaches each surface is determined. This process can be

00:01:24.624 --> 00:01:28.282
unrealistic but can be computed extremely fast, We'll start with a second

00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:31.822
extreme and, and in later lessons show how we can remove or modify various

00:01:31.822 --> 00:01:35.775
simplifications, so the more photon based computations are performed, such as

00:01:35.775 --> 00:01:36.663
casting shadows.
