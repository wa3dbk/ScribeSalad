00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.360
Now the fire projectile from one awesome robot, towards the other evil robot,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.744
we have take into account just a teeny bit of math. Firstly, for mouse input,

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:11.335
we need to find the directional vector that represents a line from the robot

00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:16.572
location to the mouse cursor in game space. To do this, we simply subtract the

00:00:16.572 --> 00:00:21.080
mouse position from the robot position, giving us an unnormalized vector. We

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.915
can normalize this vector and use it to define the velocity path for the

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:28.689
projectile, fill in the code, as specified.
