00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.539
The shorter leg is 20 meters long, the longer leg is 21 meters, and the

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:10.782
hypotenuse is 29 meters. Great work if you found all three. Now, the setup

00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:13.680
might have been tough, so if you got stuck there, watch part of the solution,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.360
and then pause it and see if you can continue solving. To start setting up this

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.744
problem, we'll let x be the shortest side of our right triangle. We do this

00:00:23.744 --> 00:00:26.924
since we know the longer leg of the right triangle is 1 meter more than the

00:00:26.924 --> 00:00:33.546
shorter leg. So, we know this longer leg has to be X plus 1. And now here's

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:38.317
where we want to be careful. We know the hypotenuse is 8 meters longer than the

00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:43.505
longer leg. So, we'll take the length of the longer leg, X plus 1, and we'll

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:50.043
add on 8 meters. So, the entire length of our hypotenuse Is x plus 1 plus 8, or

00:00:50.043 --> 00:00:55.061
just x plus 9. Now we have expressions for each side of our right triangle, and

00:00:55.061 --> 00:01:00.510
we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve. We square x, which is one of the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.764
legs, and x plus 1, the other leg. This gives us these two expressions and then

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:09.092
we square by hypotenuse x plus 9, to get this expression on the right hand side

00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:14.140
of our equation. We combine the light terms here to get 2x squared and the rest

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.520
of our equation remains the same. Next we subtract each of these terms from

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.142
both sides of the equation. So we have 0 on the right, and x squared minus 16 x

00:01:24.142 --> 00:01:31.062
minus 80 on the left. Next, we factor this expression to get x minus 20, times

00:01:31.062 --> 00:01:36.268
x plus 4, equals 0. We set each factor equal to 0, which means the solutions

00:01:36.268 --> 00:01:39.864
for x could be positive 20 or negative 4, the opposite sign of the factors in

00:01:39.864 --> 00:01:45.656
the parentheses. We know a negative side length for x wouldn't make sense in

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:50.350
this case, because we would have negative 4 here. So, this solution is not

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.661
valid. When we plug in 20 for x in each of these expressions, we'll get our

00:01:54.661 --> 00:02:01.553
side links of 20, 21, and 29. With the hypotenuse being the longest one of 29

00:02:01.553 --> 00:02:06.349
units. And since our original side links were reported in meters, we report

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:08.419
each of these in meters.
