00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.810
Let's look at the solution for our laundry

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.920
pipelining quiz. We have a washer, dryer and

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.135
folder. Each takes one hour. We have ten

00:00:08.135 --> 00:00:12.190
loads of laundry. With no pipelining, one load takes

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.983
three hours to finish. Only then we begin

00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:18.089
the next load. So it's going to take 30 hours

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.357
to do them, because we do them one

00:00:20.357 --> 00:00:25.030
at a time. Each takes three hours. With pipelining,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.170
the first load will take one, two, three hours. So, so far we are no better off.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.110
However, once the first load is in the folder, the second load is already in the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.720
dryer. When the first load leaves the pipeline

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.690
after three hours, it takes only one hour to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.540
do the folding for the next load. So

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.270
we have, after the initial three hours, one load

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.578
leaving every hour. So what we have, really,

00:00:54.578 --> 00:00:57.680
is three hours for the first load, plus

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.456
one hour for the remaining loads. Overall, it

00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:05.570
takes only 12 hours to process the ten loads.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.950
As you can see, by planning, you can

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.200
significantly improve the execution time, when we have many

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.260
things to do. And, when you have instructions,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.990
you usually have a lot of them to do.
