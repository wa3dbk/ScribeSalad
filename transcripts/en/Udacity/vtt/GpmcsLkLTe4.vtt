00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.440
So here's the Python expression to compute that. We're multiplying

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.960
the speed of light times 100 cm in a meter, times

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.090
1 divided by 1 billion. One nanosecond is one billionth of

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.660
a second. You'll note that I can't have space in the

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.510
numbers. It's convenient when I write out the numbers to put

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.480
spaces in them, so we can see how big they are.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.280
Python doesn't allow that, that looks like separate numbers if we

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.250
have spaces there that wouldn't be valid in the Python grammar.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.020
So we can't have the spaces there, so when we run

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.460
this we get the result 29. That says it's about 29

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.980
centimeters that light travels in one nanosecond. This is a little

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.520
surprising that is an exact number, and it's an integer, and

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.050
the reason it's an integer is because of the way Python

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.600
does arithmetic. If all the numbers here are integers, Python will

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.950
truncate down to that integer. If we want a more accurate

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.330
result we should turn one of these numbers into a decimal number.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.950
So now we've changed the one to 1.0, now we run it we get 29.979. Two, four,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.240
five, eight, so almost 30 centimeters, which is a better answer than 29 was.
