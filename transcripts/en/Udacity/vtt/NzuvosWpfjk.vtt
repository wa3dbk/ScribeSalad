00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.183
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:03.183 --> 00:00:06.623
Just like accents, different accents
if you go from the East Coast,

00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:10.800
there's an accent, a different way
of saying things to the West Coast.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.010
I think in different families,
the language could very quite a bit,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.890
but I think in general, I mean just like
the Southern, the Central, the Northern,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.750
and they are all very similar in their
pronunciations like I would say looty.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.810
And it's a sound with the tongue on
the back of the teeth with your T.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.150
But there are three different ways
to pronounce the T in the language.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.070
You can do a hard T, a soft T, or

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.089
an extended T, and depending on
how you pronounce it could vary.

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:52.890
I think it would make sense for
the coastal Miwok region plains, lake,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.669
any region of the Miwok to create their
own app, language app if the need is
