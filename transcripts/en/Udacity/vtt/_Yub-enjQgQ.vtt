00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.760
Now that we have all the participants, how do you think we should assign them

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.140
into the two different groups? Should we have each participant flip a coin and

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.310
put them in the experimental group that gets caffeine if their coin lands on

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.850
heads? And put them in the control group without caffeine if their coin lands

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.090
on tales? Should one group be males and the other group be females? Should the

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.430
first half of the participants who show up get caffeine and the second half of

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.830
the participants who show up not get caffeine? Should the people who normally

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.210
have caffeine be in the experimental group? And, the people who don't normally

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.909
have caffeine be in the control group? Select the best option.
