00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.560
Since we've now had a little bit of
practice with combining like terms, I want

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.574
to make sure that it's abundantly clear
which terms we're allowed to combine and

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:11.192
which ones we're not. Terms that you're
trying to add together can be combined if

00:00:11.192 --> 00:00:16.291
and only if two things are true. So first
things first, the terms have to have

00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:22.749
exactly the same variable or variables. So
examples of this will be terms like 3xy

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:31.199
and 7xy or -4b and 15b. On top of this I
have to add that each of these variables

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.251
that correspond to another have to have
the same powers or the same exponents. So,

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:43.090
if we have the term 3x^2 and the term 6x,
and we try to add those together, we

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.963
cannot combine them. These are not like
terms, even though they have x's in them,

00:00:47.963 --> 00:00:53.190
this is 3x^2 and this is just 6x to the
first power. They don't have the same

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.396
power, so we can't squish them down into 1
term. Another example of this would be

00:00:57.396 --> 00:01:04.596
something like 11ab^3 + 12a^2b3.
Even if the b^3 factors have the same

00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:10.152
power, the a here only has a power of 1
and the a here has the power of 2.

00:01:10.152 --> 00:01:14.258
We cannot add these two things together
because one of the variables involved

00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:18.552
does not have the same power in both terms. So,
we cannot squish them down into one term.
