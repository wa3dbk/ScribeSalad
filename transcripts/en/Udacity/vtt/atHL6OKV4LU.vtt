Okay, so tell me when we saw that Alice's algorithm for finding a valid vertex cover

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.790
is very inefficient but fairly easy to program too, so I'd like to go ahead and try and implement this

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.110
and we'll do this in two separate parts.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.670
First, I want you to find a procedure validity check that returns true if and only if the given cover

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.490
is a valid vertex cover for the graph that is input, and the graph is going to be a list of lists,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.460
an adjacency matrix like we have seen before, and the cover is simply going to be a list

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.950
of the same length as the number of vertices in the graph.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.840
So for example for the given graph, if we attempted to cover of say A and C,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.710
then the cover that we would input to validity check would be 1, 0, 1, 0, and the graph

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:08.100
that we would have be 0, 1, 1, 0 inside the list 1, 0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0, 1; 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, again in a list.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.230
So these would be our inputs to validity check here.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.820
So I want you to do is fill in the rest of this function here.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:24.020
The next thing that I want you to do is fill in vertex cover naive where it simply takes the input graph

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:32.860
as a list of list as an adjacent to matrix and finds the minimum vertex cover of that input graph,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.520
and you can use the validity check to do this.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.630
So your code should check if the assignment is valid for a given assignment, should calculate

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.700
the size of the assignment, and then it should update the minimum vertex cover variable if appropriate.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.850
So okay. Great. I hope you have fun with this problem.
