00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.155
If I started with 0, I know the absolute value or the distance of 0 from 0 is,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.513
well, 0. So, 0 plus 4, that doesn't make 12, so 0 is out. If you try positive 3,

00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:15.849
the absolute value of positive 3 is just 3. So, 3 plus 4, that doesn't make 12

00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:21.266
either. If we tried negative 3, the absolute value of negative 3 is positive 3.

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:25.875
And I know that 3 plus 4 makes 7, which isn't 12. So, negative 3 is out, too.

00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:30.860
How about 8? Yeah, the absolute value of 8 is positive 8 and 8 plus 4 is 12. The

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:35.815
same would be true for negative 8. If I take the absolute value of negative 8, I

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:40.630
get positive 8 and positive 8 plus 4, that's 12. If you try negative 12 and 12,

00:00:40.737 --> 00:00:46.010
these won't work either. This is great. We know the number can equal 8 or

00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:46.681
negative 8.
