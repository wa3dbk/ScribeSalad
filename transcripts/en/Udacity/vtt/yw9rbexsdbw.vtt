00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.350
Today we'll wrap up this course. It's been a fun journey. But like all journeys,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.150
this one too must come to an end. The goal for today's lesson is to

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.820
tie together some of the big things we have been discussing, and

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.860
to point to some of the other big ideas out there in the community.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.630
We'll start by revisiting the high level structure of the course.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.930
Then we'll go through some of recurrent patterns and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.078
principles we've encountered throughout the course. Finally,

00:00:25.078 --> 00:00:28.720
we'll talk about all the broader impacts and applications of knowledge based AI.
