If you're willing to discuss this, this would a good topic on the discussion

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.550
boards. Many of us have been exposed to token economies. I remember being

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.960
exposed to a token economy in elementary school, where we earned stars for

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.347
every book that we read. And at the end of the semester, we could trade those

00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:21.084
stars in for all types of valuable toys and activities. Also parents use token

00:00:21.084 --> 00:00:25.595
economies quite often with their children. When they try to get them to do

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:30.299
their homework, to brush their teeth or make their bed. So, for example, a

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:35.102
child can earn a star for every day of the week that they make their bed. And

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:38.642
at the end of the week, those stars can be traded in for activities such us

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:44.192
video game playing or perhaps even earning money to buy a new toy. Finally, if

00:00:44.192 --> 00:00:47.846
any of you have ever watched the show Super Nanny, you have seen her put token

00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:52.580
economies to excellent use in trying to manage child behavior.
