00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.746
So the answer is 1 seventh, which is

00:00:02.746 --> 00:00:05.640
pretty good. There aren't many things that we

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.810
deal with where we can think of them in terms of fractions of the speed of light

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.558
and fractions above 10%. So our data was

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:17.706
traveling between California and Massachusetts at a speed of

00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:23.280
about 43,000 kilometers per second. And most of

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.340
that time is not the time on the wire.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.980
While the data's traveling on the wires, it's traveling pretty close to

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.825
the speed of light. The speed of light through optical fiber is about

00:00:31.825 --> 00:00:35.150
50% slower than light travels in a vacuum. But what's taking up

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.280
most of the time is all the routers that it had to go

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.220
through. And we saw that, from the traceroute, that it went through

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.900
about 20 routers. So each of those routers had to take a packet

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.950
in, figure out where to send it, and do all that in the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.380
time that it had to travel across the country, which was a 100

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.720
milliseconds total, so the average speed going across the country

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.860
was one seventh the speed of light, I can show

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.490
you the Python code to compute that. So we have

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.080
the distance which is 4300, that's the number of kilometers between

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.720
Palo Alto and Cambridge. We have the speed of light,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.840
which is approximately 300,000 kilometers per second. And we have the

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.520
time it took, which, since we're using seconds as our

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.580
unit for the speed of light, we should put in seconds.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.164
And so it as 100 milliseconds, which is 0.1

00:01:18.164 --> 00:01:20.990
seconds. And so I can compute the time it took

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.070
light to travel that distance. By dividing the distance by

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.640
the speed of light and let's see what that is.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.730
So if it was travelling at the speed of light it

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.828
would take 0.014 seconds to get across the country, which is

00:01:36.828 --> 00:01:40.670
14 milliseconds. What it actually took was a 100 milliseconds. And

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.760
if we divide the time it actually took by the time

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.890
it would take light to travel, we get 6.97. So, it's

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.960
taking almost seven times as long as it would take if

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.950
it was just light traveling in a vacuum for that distance.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.010
If you had a vacuum between Palo Alto and Cambridge and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.410
no routers and nothing else along the way, well then

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.420
you could get your packets across about seven times faster than

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.110
the internet actually does. Not many people can afford setting up

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.870
a dedicated vacuum between the two points they want to communicate.
