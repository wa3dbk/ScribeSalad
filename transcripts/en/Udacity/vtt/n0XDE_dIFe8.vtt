00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.021
We've just seen how we can write an absolute value inequality. Which we see,

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:08.385
involves only 2 things related to one another, into a compound inequality. Where

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:12.186
we have 3 quantities related to one another. And, of course, I've used G

00:00:12.186 --> 00:00:16.413
notation. This is because when you take the absolute value of a number. You're

00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:20.676
creating an upper and a lower bound for its size. Going off of this, what if we

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:25.335
had the absolute value of 3x minus 5 is less than 4. How could we write this as

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:30.063
a chained inequality? For right now just leave the quantity 3x minus 5 as a

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.477
single blocked unit.
