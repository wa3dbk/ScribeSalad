00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.860
Now that we understand abduction, and now that we know the diagnosis is

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.470
an instance of abduction, let us ask ourselves, how does this understanding help

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.950
us in choosing hypotheses? So the first principle for choosing a hypothesis is

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.775
explanatory coverage. A hypotheses must cover as much of the data as possible.

00:00:18.775 --> 00:00:23.880
Here's an example, hypotheses H3 explain data items D1 through D8.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.860
Hypothesis H7 explains data item D5 to D9.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.482
Assuming that all of these data elements are equally important or

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:39.127
equally salient, we may prefer H3 over H7 because it explains for

00:00:39.127 --> 00:00:42.103
of the data than does H7. The second principle for

00:00:42.103 --> 00:00:46.550
choosing between competing hypotheses is called the principle of Parsimony.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.470
All things being equal, we want to pick the simplest explanation for the data.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.760
So consider the following scenario. H2 explains data elements D1 to D3.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.570
H4 explains data elements D1 through D8. H6 explains data

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.690
elements D4 to D6 and H8 explains data elements D7 to D9.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.390
Now if you went by the criteria of explanatory coverage, then we might pick H2,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.540
plus H6, plus H8, because the three of them combined, explain more than just H4.

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:26.010
However, the criteria of Parsimony would suggest if you pick H4,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.990
because H4 alone, explains almost all the data, and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.280
we don't need the other three hypothesis. In general this is a balancing act

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.550
between these two principles. We want to both maximize the coverage, and

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.120
maximize the parsimony. Based on this particular example, we may go with H4 and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.430
H8. The two together explain all the data and in addition,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.050
the set of these two hypotheses is smaller than these set of hypotheses H2,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.010
H6, and H8. The [UNKNOWN] criteria for choosing between competing hypotheses is

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.810
that we want to pick those hypotheses in which we have more confidence.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.330
Some hypotheses are more likely than others. You may have more confidence in

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.080
some hypotheses than in others. As an example, in this particular scenario,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.670
H3 may explain data items D1 to D8 and H5 may explain more data

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.850
elements from D1 to D9. So H5 also explains D9 that H3 doesn't.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.660
However, we may have more confidence in H3, and so we may pick H3 instead of H5.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.540
Once again this is a balancing act between these three criteria for

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.370
choosing between competing diagnostic hypotheses. A quick point to note here,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.310
these three criteria are useful for choosing between competing hypotheses even

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.490
if the task is not diagnosis. The same problem occurs for

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.620
example in intelligence analysis. Imagine that you have some data that needs to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.295
be explained and your competing hypothesis for explaining that particular data,

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:56.920
well, you may pick between the competing hypothesis based on this criteria.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.060
All of the task is not a diagnostic task. These three criteria are useful for

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.536
explanation. Diagnosis simply happens to be an example of this [UNKNOWN] task.
