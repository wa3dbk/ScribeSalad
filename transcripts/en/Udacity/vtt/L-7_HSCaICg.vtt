Thanks Raido, with that in mind let's add

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.450
a Refresh Menu button to our app. For temporary

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.920
purposes only though, otherwise Raido would be mad at

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.882
us. On Android, menu options are defined in XML

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:14.440
and they can be declared for fragments or

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.390
activities. When the fragment or activity is created, it

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.790
inflates this XML into the actual menu items in

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.440
the app. You'll see that there are Action buttons

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.230
which are menu items that appear in the Action bar,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.670
such as this Search Menu item. This space is reserved

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.550
for the most prominent actions in your app. Then anything

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.990
else that's less important falls into the overflow menu by

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.790
tapping on this button with the three dots. These menu

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.560
items are ordered from most frequently used to least frequently

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.550
used. And on larger devices that have more screen real

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.710
estate, you can specify that some of these menu items can

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.120
actually go into the Action bar if there's room. If

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.160
you go back to our project in the Resources folder

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.660
which is called res, there is a Menu folder and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.990
inside that there's a main.xml file. If you open that up

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.360
you see the menu layout XML, and that there's a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.130
single menu option defined for Settings. It will never show up

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.350
as an action in the Action bar, meaning that it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.780
will be in the Overflow menu. You can verify this by

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.880
checking the app on your phone. To define the ordering

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.200
of menu items, you can just add multiple items to this

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.580
XML file, and then they will show up in that order

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.680
in the app. If you don't like the order though, and

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.460
you want to explicitly set it, then you can specify

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.030
this order in Category, value. Right now it's set as 100,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.460
so that the Settings menu will be at the bottom of

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.040
all the other menu options that we define in our app.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.250
The only Menu option that should show up below the Settings

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.450
menu is the Help menu. Check out the link for more details.
