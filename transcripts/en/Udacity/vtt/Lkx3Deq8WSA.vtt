00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.810
There are three basic checks that you
should make before releasing any app

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.100
that will cover the majority
of accessibility scenarios.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.010
First, you need to provide
content descriptions for

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.820
user interface components that
do not have visible text.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.059
This is most important for
buttons, check boxes, and

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.650
images because these components
often influence the flow of the app.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.210
So use the android:contentDescription
layout attribute or

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.480
the setContentDescription() Java
method to provide this information for

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.690
accessibility services.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.840
Note however that decorative graphics
are the exception to this rule, but

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.230
be sure to indicate this by setting
content description to NULL.Second,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.520
you should make sure that users
can navigate your screen layouts

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.060
by using the hardware based, or
software directional controls.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.860
Many users will employ D-pads,
trackballs, keyboards, and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.100
navigation gestures, and you should be
confident that your Apple support these.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.070
Put an exceptional focus on ensuring
that any UIElement that accepts input

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.810
Is reachable.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.280
In some cases, this may require that
UI components are focusable, or

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.900
else you may need to adjust
the focus order to be more logical.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.240
Finally, audio feedback must always
have a secondary feedback mechanism,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.250
to support users who are deaf or
hard of hearing.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.860
For example, a sound alert for the
arrival of a message must be accompanied

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.500
by a system notification, haptic
feedback or some other visual queue.
