00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.400
So here's another game tree. We have, again, two

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.150
players, a and b, and a gets to make

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.530
a choice, first, to go left or right. And

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.750
b will find herself in a situation, perhaps, where

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.220
she gets to choose to go left or right

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.350
as well. I've drawn these little square boxes, though,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.500
to represent chance. So what this means is that

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.200
if a goes left, you end up in a chance

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.950
box where you flip a coin and 50% of the time you end up over here, and 50% of

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.930
the time you end up over here. Along a similar

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.260
vein, if a goes right and then b goes left,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.430
then you end up in another chance node, and 80%

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.540
of the time you end up here, and 20% of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.960
the time you end up here. Alternatively, if b goes

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.470
right, you always end up here. Does that make sense?

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.970
&gt;&gt; I think so. Uh-huh.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.580
&gt;&gt; So what we've done is we've gone from

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.150
a two player zero-sum deterministic game of perfect information

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.030
to a two player zero-sum non-deterministic game of

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.210
perfect information. Okay, so we've relaxed, we gone at

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.270
least one level up in complexity. Okay, so do

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.890
you understand this tree? Do you understand this setup?

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so. I mean here

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.370
the stochasticness is happening essentially at the leaves.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.170
&gt;&gt; What does that mean?

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.150
&gt;&gt; That there's no choices to make for either player after this

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.070
randomness happens. But is that. That's not what you mean in general, right?

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.030
&gt;&gt; No, that's right. There could be,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.880
after here, you end up in a different state

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
where you can then make more choices. But because

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.040
I don't have enough room, maybe because I want to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.250
make it simple, it just sort of ends after that.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.910
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.390
&gt;&gt; But yes, this tree could keep going

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.140
on and there could be choice, random, choices chance

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.160
nodes happening everywhere. There could have been a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.010
chance node that happened at the very beginning, even.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.220
&gt;&gt; I feel like I could work out the value of this game.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.730
&gt;&gt; Oh, well, how would you go about working out the value of the game?

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.080
&gt;&gt; I would

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.480
probably have it as a quiz.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.580
&gt;&gt; Okay, but what would the quiz look like?

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.340
&gt;&gt; It would say, what's the value of this game?

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.490
&gt;&gt; Okay. Do you think that just having that be the quiz is the best

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.470
way for someone to learn or do you think maybe it can be done in stages?

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.660
&gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know. Do you have other questions that you want to ask?

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.790
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, how would you go about

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.852
determining the value of the game? I think the first

00:02:00.852 --> 00:02:02.490
thing that you would do, at least if you were

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.110
patterning after what we just did, is you would try

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.020
to write down a matrix.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.150
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.242
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to write down a matrix. So

00:02:11.242 --> 00:02:13.426
that our students will get a chance to, to work out

00:02:13.426 --> 00:02:15.766
what that matrix looks like and then from there figure

00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:17.780
out the value of the game. Are you okay with that?

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.660
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.860
&gt;&gt; Okay. So if we were going to do

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.526
that of course. The first thing we'd have to

00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:23.716
do is we'd have to figure out, figure out

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:27.520
what the strategies are. So. What are a's strategies.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.180
&gt;&gt; I would have called them left and right but it, but they're not labeled.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah well let's

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.850
do that we can call them left and right. A can

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.010
go left or A can go right. What about B's strategies?

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.940
&gt;&gt; B can go left or right.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.981
&gt;&gt; And B can go left or right.
