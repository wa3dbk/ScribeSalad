00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.930
Okay, so this is what I think. HTML response turns into Tokens which

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.200
turns into Nodes which turn into the DOM Tree. That one is true.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.570
That's the process we just learned. In this one,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.910
each token like startTag and endTag get converted into DOM nodes.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.470
This is in fact false. A single DOM node will start with a startTag token and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.040
end with an endTag token. Between the startTag and

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.270
endTag tokens come other tokens which will define one DOM node. In this one,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.060
Nodes contain all relevant information about the HTML element. This is true.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.120
The information will be described using tokens. And the last one,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.520
Nodes are connected into a DOM tree based on token hierarchy. This one is true.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.020
If another set of startTag and endTag tokens come between startTag and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.580
endTag, you have a node inside a node,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.650
and this is how we define the hierarchy of the DOM tree.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.410
Lastly, it's also worth noting that DOM construction is incremental.
