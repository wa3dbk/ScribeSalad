00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:05.040
Eucher's theory says that only the
numbers that are relatively prime to n

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.020
have multiplicative inverse not n.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.390
So, what does relatively prime mean?

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.370
If x is relatively prime to n,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.110
that means there is no common factor
between x and n other than 1.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.977
For example, three is relatively
prime to 10 whereas two

00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:25.710
is not relatively prime to 10.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.890
For given n how many integers
are relatively prime to n?

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.520
This is measured as
a totient function of n.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.950
How do we compute totient n?

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.960
If n is a prime number, then totient
n is n-1, because every number that's

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.085
smaller than n is also relatively primed
to n because n is prime number itself.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:52.055
If n equal to p times q and p and

00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:56.735
q are prime numbers, then totient
n is p minus 1 times q minus 1.

00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:59.515
You can verify this easily on your own.

00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:04.974
More generally, if n equals to p
times q and p and q are relatively

00:01:04.974 --> 00:01:10.245
prime to each other, then totient
n is totient p times totient q.
