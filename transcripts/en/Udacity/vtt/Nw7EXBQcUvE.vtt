00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let me walk you through one way to do this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
As always, the most important part of a token definition

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is the regular expression that it corresponds to.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here we can optionally start with a minus sign.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Then we definitely have one or more digits, 867, 3, 1.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And then there's a big optional part.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can have a dot and then some number of digits after that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We could have the dot and then some number of digits.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
-1. is okay or 3.14159.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Here we've got 5 trailing digits. Here we've got 0 of them.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And this whole dot followed by digits is optional.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But remember that the dot has special meaning in regular expressions,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so I'm going to need to use a \ to escape it to say

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we literally mean the period and not any character.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Then we turn that string into a floating point number.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Then we return it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Just to walk through these again, this part, the optional minus sign,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
catches either this minus sign or the nothing that's in front of this 3.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And this part here is this 1, this 3, or 867.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This dot, literally a dot, is this dot, that dot,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and I think there was one under here, and then this part

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is 14159, 5309,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
or the nothing that's here after this dot.
