Let's create one new restaurant and we'll assign this to the name yummys. Now we

00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:09.237
have a question. What do you think display_restaurant(yummys) will do? The

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:13.742
choices are, it prints out Yummy's Realm of Yumacity. It prints out yummys. It

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:18.365
gives an Attribute Error because there's (no name) attribute, or it gives a Type

00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:20.853
Error because yummys is not a restaurant.
