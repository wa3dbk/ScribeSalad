00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.890
So let's look at the solution to
our load link store conditional

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.190
lock implementation quiz.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.080
This is what this code is trying to do.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.120
It's putting one in R1 and
then it's loading the current value of

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.084
the lockvar into R2 and then trying
to put a one into the lockvar.

00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:24.892
All of these choices are repeating
the try to require the lock

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:26.877
under some conditions.

00:00:26.877 --> 00:00:32.080
So the question is what are the correct
conditions for retrying the lock?

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.640
Well, there are two conditions
that need to be checked.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.543
One is did we actually
see a lock that was free?

00:00:40.543 --> 00:00:43.060
The lock is free when we read a zero.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.150
In that case, we don't go back.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.650
We actually saw a lock that was free.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.340
If the lock was busy, we go back.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.110
So if R2 is zero, then we actually
don't go back to try lock.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.600
That means that we are actually
acquiring the lock successfully so far.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.750
So this is definitely
not a correct solution.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.584
We need to check R2 for not equal zero.

00:01:09.584 --> 00:01:12.252
Meaning, we found a nonzero value here.

00:01:12.252 --> 00:01:15.100
That means that the lock was busy and
we retry.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.390
So one of these three are going
to be the correct answer,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.130
because they include the correct check
for whether the lock was available.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.974
The second thing that we need to check
is if we found the lock available,

00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:30.418
which means we are past this point.

00:01:30.418 --> 00:01:31.461
We need to check,

00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:36.540
whether we successfully stored R1
without somebody else beating us to it.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.060
We successfully store R1,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.390
if R1 after the store
conditional has a value of one.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.501
So we fail to store R1 successfully
if R1 is equal to zero.

00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:55.570
That means that this is
really the correct solution.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.714
Note that these two are checking
the link register directly and

00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:03.168
we said that the link registry
is a hidden register.

00:02:03.168 --> 00:02:06.553
It can really only be accessed
implicitly through load-link and

00:02:06.553 --> 00:02:08.889
store-conditional instructions.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:13.066
There is no instruction that can
directly read the link registers, so

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.918
that's why these two
are not correct choices.

00:02:15.918 --> 00:02:17.668
So in this lock function,

00:02:17.668 --> 00:02:22.761
basically what we are doing is if we saw
the lock that was free and we managed to

00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:27.795
store R1 into it without anybody
interfering, then we acquire the lock.

00:02:29.325 --> 00:02:32.365
If we saw the lock was busy,
we try again.

00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:36.675
If the lock was free, but somebody beat
us to it, then again, we try again.
