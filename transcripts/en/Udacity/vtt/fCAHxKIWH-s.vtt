00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.822
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Distributing multiplication by a to both terms inside the parentheses gives

00:00:04.822 --> 00:00:09.348
us a times b or ab plus a times c or ac. So now, we can see that both terms here

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:13.915
have a common factor of a. This is basically the opposite of the step that we

00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:18.710
took in modifying our equation earlier. We're getting rid of our parentheses

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.636
here instead of adding them in.
