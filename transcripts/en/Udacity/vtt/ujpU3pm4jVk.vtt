00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.030
We just saw what a request
to a server looks like, and

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.300
we mentioned that the request used was
a GET request, but what does it mean for

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.980
a request to be a GET request.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.090
A GET request is a type of HTTP request
where a client requests a specified

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.540
resource from a server.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.760
For example, the client could make a GET
request for an image on a server and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.710
then the server could return it back.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.600
A GET request is just one of
several kinds of HTTP requests,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.460
also called HTTP methods,
and it's the most common.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.384
Now you'll note,

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:34.080
in this course I'm going to avoid using
the term HTTP method to much because I

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.398
don't want to confuse the term with
what we know as methods in Swift.

00:00:37.398 --> 00:00:40.302
Let's look more closely at
GET request by reusing or

00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:42.700
example of Udacity's homepage.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.070
When you visit Udacity's
homepage in a web browser,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.710
you're making a GET request.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.698
By typing in the URL udacity.com in the
address bar, you're specify a resource,

00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:56.273
in this case you'd ask the homepage
from a server somewhere in the network.

00:00:56.273 --> 00:00:58.462
And you're saying, hey, get this for me.

00:00:58.462 --> 00:01:02.062
And when we hit enter, the request is
made and we can see that it's a success

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:05.220
because the server's responded
with Udacity's homepage.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.760
But there's so much more happening than
meets the eye when you make this request

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.250
on a web browser.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.210
To show you what's really
happening under the hood,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.218
I'm going to use the Chrome
app called Postman.

00:01:15.218 --> 00:01:17.800
If you want to follow along
I'll post the download link

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.180
in the instructor notes, but

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.740
you'll need to already have installed
Google Chrome in order to use it.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.465
Okay, so here's the Postman app.

00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:28.390
At the top bar, you can make a request,
much like we did in the web browser.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.610
But here to the left,
we can also specify the type of request.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.120
For this request, we'll leave
it as the default, which is GET.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.910
Now let's type in the URL for
Udacity's homepage, and hit Send.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.400
Wow, okay, so
there's a lot to observer here.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.910
Let's go step by step.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.530
For now,
I'm going to hide this side panel,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.130
which shows a history of
the request that we've made.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.553
Here at the top we have some tabs for
Authorization, Headers,

00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:53.501
Pre-request script, and Tests.

00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:56.130
We're going to skip these for
now and come back to them later.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.800
let's focus our attention
here on the Body.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.129
This is the response that the server
returned when we made a GET request for

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:03.375
you Udacity's homepage.

00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:06.169
But it doesn't look anything like
the homepage we're used to seeing.

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:10.020
It's just a bunch of html,
CSS and JavaScript code.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.270
That's because all of this code is
normally loaded, interpreted, and

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.010
rendered by our web browser.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.990
If we click on the Preview option, we
can see a low fidelity version of what

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.030
this would look like if
it was loaded by Chrome.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.811
Next, I want to look at the Status
section where it says, 200 OK.

00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:29.740
This is what is know as a status code.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.060
A status code gives us a quick
indication of whether the HTTP request

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.100
succeeded, failed, or something else.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.200
There are many different possible
status codes that can be returned for

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.920
an HTTP request.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.210
I'll post a link in the instructor notes
if you want to read about them more.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.540
The most important thing to note is that
anytime we get a status code that begins

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.820
with a 2,
it means the request was successful.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.450
Let's hover over the status code so

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.370
we can see a little bit of
information about what it means.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.437
It says that a 200 status code
is the standard response for

00:02:59.437 --> 00:03:01.690
a successful HTTP request, and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.620
that the actual response depends on
the type of request that was used.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.770
Because we used a GET request up here,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.200
we're seeing the entity that
corresponds to the requested resource,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.420
which in this case was the Udacity
homepage and all of it's code.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.320
Also, at the bottom of this description,
it mentions a new type of request,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.810
called a POST request, which we'll
talk about later in this course.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.750
The next thing we see is the time
it took to execute our request

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.830
in milliseconds,
which was 1,350 milliseconds.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.790
This is important to keep in mind.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.160
When we make requests over the network
it does take some amount of time for

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.330
us to get a response.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.720
It's not always instantaneous.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.170
So when we start making these requests
in code, we'll have to consider what we

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.290
want our app to do while
it's waiting on a response.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.950
Now let's try a different URL.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.176
This time I'm going to use a URL that
I know doesn't refer to a page on

00:03:50.176 --> 00:03:51.301
Udacity's website.

00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:53.948
I'll go ahead and hit Send.

00:03:53.948 --> 00:03:57.797
And this time we get a response,
but notice the new status code,

00:03:57.797 --> 00:03:58.900
which is 404.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.480
If we hover over the status code it says
the requested resource can't be found.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.328
Anytime we see a status code
that begins with a 4 or

00:04:06.328 --> 00:04:08.795
5, it indicates some kind of error.

00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:11.880
Bu, even though we have an error,
we still get a response.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.950
If you look at the the response
in Preview mode, we see that it's

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.890
a page that says, we're sorry,
what you're looking for doesn't exist.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.170
This is commonly referred
to as a 404 page.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.870
Not all websites have these, but
the awesome engineers at Udacity

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.860
have created this 404 page so in case
you request a page that doesn't exist,

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.810
you still see something that feels
like Udacity's normal website.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.130
Okay, I have one more example.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.420
This time let's request
an image instead of a webpage.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.440
This is the kind of request we'll make
when we build the app for this lesson.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.710
I'll type in my request and hit Send.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.450
This time we get a image as
a response instead of HTML code.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.325
And that's the last point
I want to make here,

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:56.942
when we make HTTP requests the data
that we get back can be images, text,

00:04:56.942 --> 00:04:59.754
HTML code and
various other types of media.

00:04:59.754 --> 00:05:03.468
If you have some time I highly recommend
that you download Postman yourself and

00:05:03.468 --> 00:05:04.690
experiment.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.640
I'll also post some links in
the instructor notes for other similar

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.600
tools in case you don't use
Google Chrome as your normal browser.
