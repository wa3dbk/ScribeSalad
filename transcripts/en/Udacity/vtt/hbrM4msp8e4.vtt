00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.370
As an alternative formulation of the same story, we could have a table. And

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.980
typically the table will have three columns. One column is the agent or

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.720
actor involved in that particular step of the story, and

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.800
this is going to be Foster. And it's going to be the Amazon web server.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.400
The second column indicates the action that's taking place.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.570
This might be the user action it might be the system response and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.630
the third column, contains information about any object, that, is conveyed,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.890
in that particular step. So it might be for example credit card information.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.850
Same information in the unstructured version and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.270
the tabular version. They’re both examples of use cases, and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.640
they would represent the content of one of the ovals used in this diagram.
