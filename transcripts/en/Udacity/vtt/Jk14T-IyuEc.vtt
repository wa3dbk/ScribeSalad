In the last lesson we dealt with Grant's monthly expenses. We found out that he

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:09.376
pays $1,200 each month in rent and that every wipers that he bills costs him

00:00:09.388 --> 00:00:13.771
$6.5o cents to make. Let's suppose that this time we don't know how much money

00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:18.568
Grant spends total, and instead, we're going to represent that with a variable

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.805
y. Let's also let x equal the total number of wiper sets he makes.

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:27.950
So using this information, can you write an equation that relates y to x?
