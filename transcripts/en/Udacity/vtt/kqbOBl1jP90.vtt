00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.341
So I remember seeing on the web
page a link called Cricket, so

00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:08.650
I am going to start and
actually find this link.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.650
Again, I open the web order.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.250
&gt;&gt; Headings menu.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.440
&gt;&gt; You notice I'm on Headings, so
I'm going to left arrow to Links.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.990
&gt;&gt; Links menu.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.987
&gt;&gt; And I begin typing cricket.

00:00:18.987 --> 00:00:22.870
&gt;&gt; 9 items, link, link, cricket.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.400
&gt;&gt; Here it is,
I'm going to press Enter, and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.710
the focus will go straight
to the cricket link.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.635
&gt;&gt; Link, cricket, cricket.

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:35.640
&gt;&gt; Now I'm going to activate this
link by pressing Ctrl+Opt+Space bar.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.570
This is a voice over shortcut key.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.310
&gt;&gt; Press link, cricket, cricket,
with cricket, Wikipedia,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.580
the free encyclopedia page
has 1,079 links, 52 headings,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.100
4 form controls,
12 tables, 14 landmarks.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.710
&gt;&gt; So again,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.320
you may have noticed that voice over
just pronounced the page summary.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.138
It told me how many headings, links,
tables, and form fields on the page

00:00:59.138 --> 00:01:03.529
there are, which is a lot, there's like
1,000 links or something like that.

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:05.648
But we're not interested
in links anymore,

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:08.950
what we're going to do next
is look at the form fields.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.032
So I'm going to open web order again.

00:01:11.032 --> 00:01:13.340
&gt;&gt; Headings menu, Links menu.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.660
&gt;&gt; And
arrow right until I reach Form Controls.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.660
&gt;&gt; Form Controls menu.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.376
&gt;&gt; From here, I want to search for

00:01:20.376 --> 00:01:24.336
a form field with a label of search
because I'm going to be searching for

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:27.867
something,
&gt;&gt; 13 items, 2, 1 item.

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:29.356
&gt;&gt; Here it is.
&gt;&gt; Search insertion at beginning of

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:30.218
text, search, edit text.

00:01:30.218 --> 00:01:32.679
&gt;&gt; I will press Enter key
to jump to that field.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.720
&gt;&gt; Search insertion at beginning
of text, search, edit text.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.790
Search access key available, F.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.360
&gt;&gt; You've noticed Screen Reader told
me the label of this field, but it also

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.920
told me that there is an access key, or
in other words, the shortcut key that I

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.100
can press to quickly jump to this search
field from anywhere on the web page.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.660
If you're interested in
how access keys work,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.570
please look into instructor's notes for
more information.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.102
So what I'll do here,
I'll type the word Udacity.

00:02:02.102 --> 00:02:07.039
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.720
&gt;&gt; Udacity, Wikipedia, the free
encyclopedia page has 346 links,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.530
16 headings, 4 form controls,
2 tables, 13 landmarks.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.050
&gt;&gt; Notice how Screen Reader pronounced
the word Udacity as Uda city.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.940
This is a pretty common occurrence
because the speech synthesizer is

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.120
trying to take its best guess at
how to pronounce certain words.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.990
And of course, it makes mistakes.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.130
However, Screen Reader users are pretty
resilient to these kinds of situations

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.130
because we often tend to look
at different web pages, and

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.620
words aren't always spelled
the way we expect them to be.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.950
To make the long story short,
it suffices to know that Screen Readers

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.840
do provide a lot of shortcut keys, and
one of those shortcut keys is a way to

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.680
spell a specific word or
even a sentence, letter by letter.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.250
So for example, if I did want to know
how the word Udacity is spelled,

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.150
I could simply jump to the place on
the web page where the word occurs.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.665
&gt;&gt; Heading level, heading level 2,
contents, heading level 2,

00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:12.115
4 items, history, heading level 2,
form control, 1 item,

00:03:12.115 --> 00:03:17.080
headings menu, 1 item, heading level 1,
Udacity, heading level 1, Udacity.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.007
&gt;&gt; And then I can press Ctrl+Opt+W to
have voice over spell this word out

00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:22.740
for me.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.050
&gt;&gt; Udacity, uniform, delta,
Udacity, U-D-A-C-I-T-Y.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.680
&gt;&gt; So using the alternative spelling
is just going to teach me to spell

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.980
things wrong.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.420
So please refrain from using
these methods in the name.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.430
It will improve the experience
of Screen Reader users.
