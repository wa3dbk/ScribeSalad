00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.323
Starting with x equals to 3y minus 1, we can add 1 to both sides. And then,

00:00:05.323 --> 00:00:09.763
divide both sides by 3 to end up with 1 3rd, the quantity x plus 1 is equal to

00:00:09.763 --> 00:00:16.030
y. Then, of course, we can just switch what's on either side of the equation.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.511
That way, y is on the right side of the equation, and we have y equal 1 3rd

00:00:19.511 --> 00:00:21.553
times x plus 1.
