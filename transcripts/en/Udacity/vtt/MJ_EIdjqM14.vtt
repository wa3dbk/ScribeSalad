00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
In the unit, we've been discussing fixed parameter tractable problems

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.570
and there are a lot of new things about these.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.910
First, the exponential part of the running time is restricted to the parameter k rather than

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.470
the parameter n, and at least in many cases k is much less than n.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.220
Another new thing is that they provably allow for some very effective pre-processing rules

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.530
and the details of some of these are a little bit out of scope for this course,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.660
but we can get a bit of a taste for them by working at vertex cover and noticing a few key insights.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.900
Now, let's say we have a graph G and suppose it has n vertices along with parameter k,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.180
now what I'd like to know is does she have a vertex cover of size at most k.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.570
So in other words, we were discussing the decision variant of the vertex cover problem.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.730
Another way of saying this is that at most a certain number of vertices are needed

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.500
to cover all the edges and this could be either k-1, k, 2k, k+n, or n.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.530
Another fact that this question or the answer to this question will imply is that if any vertex

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.840
is an endpoint to a certain number of edges or more, then it must be in the cover,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.210
and this could be either k-1, k, k+1, 2k, or k² edges.

00:01:28.210 --> 99:59:59.000
So for both of these questions, please check whichever on is most appropriate.
