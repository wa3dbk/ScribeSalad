00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.910
To figure out what was happening in the last question, let's just look at one

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.459
of those numbers as an example to explore more. How about that first one? 3.1

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.746
times 10 to the 4th. We can keep 3.1 as is, but we know that 10 to the 4th can

00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:18.606
be written differently. This is just 10,000. So, 3.1 times 10 to the 4th is

00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:24.170
equal to 3.1 times 10,000. What do we do now? Well, you may remember that to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.734
multiply a number by 10, you add a 0. But in reality, what you're actually

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:32.637
doing is moving the decimal point of the number one place to the right when you

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:38.990
multiply by 10. And in some cases, this requires the addition of a 0. For

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.040
example, if we look at the number 31 and we want to multiply it by 10, we need

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.870
to note that the decimal point is invisible, but it's technically right here.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.160
We need to move it from being right after the 1, the one place to the right.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.393
And since there's nothing here right now, we need to add a 0 in, then we put a

00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:59.550
decimal point after that 0. In this case though, we're dealing with 10 to the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.936
4th power, so what do we do in that situation? Well, for each 10 that's here,

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:07.275
this number is going to get ten times bigger, so the decimal needs to move one

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:12.843
step to the right in each of those factors of 10. The first time we move it, we

00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:16.700
end up with 31. The next time we move it, the decimal point would be out here,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.482
and here we have one of those invisible spaces. We know we're going to need to

00:01:21.482 --> 00:01:25.756
put a 0 there, but let's not derail ourselves at this point. We've already

00:01:25.756 --> 00:01:30.386
moved over two times, so that takes care of two of our four factors of 10. We

00:01:30.386 --> 00:01:35.298
need two more. There's our third and there is our fourth. So our decimal point

00:01:35.298 --> 00:01:39.580
started out right here. And in the end, it's all the way out here to the right.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.492
We went from having 3.1, to having 31, to having 310, to 3,100, and finally, to

00:01:46.492 --> 00:01:52.054
31,000. This is where our decimal point would belong if we decided to write it

00:01:52.054 --> 00:01:55.966
in. We know it's generally invisible though, for numbers that don't have

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:59.817
decimals written outside of them. To give you a chance to try out what we've

00:01:59.817 --> 00:02:02.589
been talking about, see if you can write out that number that we had at the end

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:08.503
of the last question. 3.1 times 10 to the 21. How would you write this using

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:11.459
our normal number notation, not scientific?
