00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.040
So the process for actually getting
an investment varies depending on

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.250
who you're taking the money from.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.170
So for example,

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.410
in places like an accelerator like
in effect it's very structured.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.270
There is a date in which have
to submit your application.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.750
The application there
includes many questions.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.970
We then review the application.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.630
We invite part of the companies for
interviews.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.600
They come for interviews,
we decide who it is.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.550
We have a date in which we announce
to them that they're in, so

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.820
that's very structured and very easy.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.190
Which is a big benefit for

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.340
the company, because they know when
it starts, they know when it ends.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.570
When you look at angel investors or
early stage funders,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.540
it's very different.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.900
The reason is that the angel investor or

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.330
the funder not have any risk constraints
on when do they need to invest.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.990
And as the early stage investor,
theoretically the best thing for

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.520
you is to delay a little bit and
see what's going to happen next,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.870
and what's going to happen next.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.650
And sure if you're about
to launch something,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.410
I'll be stupid to not wait and
see how does that go right?

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.070
Because I'm going to give you money.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.240
Now that's not true of course, why?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.650
Because as an investor if
you're delaying the company,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.950
you're basically setting yourself up for

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.239
failure because as we said,
speed is the most important thing.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.500
However, the outcome of this is that
the processes are very unstructured.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.540
And I can tell you that
there were companies where,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.880
at the end of a one hour meeting,
I told them I'm in.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.270
And then we worked on the documents for
another few days and I invested.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.680
And I can tell you there were companies
that took me half a year to invest.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.290
Because it took me half year to cross
the chasm of believing in the team.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.580
That the team is strong enough where
there's something that we call

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.810
here's product market fit
that everybody knows, but

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.392
there's also what's called a founder
product fit or a founder market fit.

00:01:39.392 --> 00:01:43.990
And so, many times it takes me a period
of time to get to know the founders,

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.650
to believe that they're the right
people to win this domain.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.230
And many times they're great people but
they're just not the right people for

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.800
this domain.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.500
So it's everything from one hour
to six months and it is for

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.290
the entrepreneur to manage the process.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.510
That's one of the things that
entrepreneur are missing in most times,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.570
in most cases.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.950
And when I said to manage the process
clearly part of it is creating this

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.380
vector of movement of investors that
are starting to invest in your company.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.750
Because investors at the end
of the day they're people and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.800
as people, well most of them are people,
and as people there is the herd effect.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.810
And when you hear that other
people started committing

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.370
it makes your life a lot easier.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.860
And so as investor, you need to sort of
plan to have everything culminates to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.230
people starting to invest and
then going gone and everybody investing.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.220
That does include planning side
which we know that was possible.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.109
But when I say managing the process,
the meaning is that you do not need,

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.150
you can't let the ball drop.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.530
And if you expect the investor to
be the one leading the process

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.450
then you're wrong because the investor
has 50 like you, that are all waiting.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.090
And it's going to be the ones
that are driving the process

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.110
that are going to be
getting more attention.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.320
And so I'm not and there is
the thin line between nagging and

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.170
overdoing it and
running the process properly.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.820
But if you're just sitting in there
waiting for the email to come back and

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.890
waiting for
somebody to set up the meeting and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.040
not being proactive,
you're losing on two form.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.970
The first thing is that somebody
else is doing to consider getting

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.940
less attention.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.610
The second thing,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.220
your ability to present the right
character to the investor goes away.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.270
And so be proactive, manage the process.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.470
And know that by basically
getting many investors

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.020
to get to the decision point at the same
time you're dramatically increasing your

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.210
chance of raising the money you want.
