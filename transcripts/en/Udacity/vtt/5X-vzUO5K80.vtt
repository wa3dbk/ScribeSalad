Thinking about what price per gallon or the units of the slope, means in the

00:00:04.532 --> 00:00:09.095
context of Grant's story and about what we've learned about slope in general,

00:00:09.197 --> 00:00:13.875
what does slope mean overall for equations and graphs? Is it the factor by which

00:00:13.887 --> 00:00:17.990
y will, will scale as x changes? Is it the ratio of the change in x to the

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:22.645
change in y? Is it the steepness of a line? Or is it the direction a line points

00:00:22.657 --> 00:00:25.232
in? You can pick as many of these as you feel are correct.
