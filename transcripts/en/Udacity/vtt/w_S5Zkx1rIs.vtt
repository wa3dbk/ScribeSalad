00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.950
Comparing this to what we have up here, P the principal belongs right here.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.854
Now, what goes here is the interest rate that we use every time interest is

00:00:08.854 --> 00:00:14.886
compounded. This is equal to the annual interest rate, r, divided by n, the

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:20.748
number of times interest is compounded per year. We can see that that's what we

00:00:20.748 --> 00:00:27.056
have up here. We have a 3% annual rate. 0.03 divided by 2, which gives us this

00:00:27.056 --> 00:00:32.610
number. Great, we're really close. Now what belongs in the exponent? We know

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.579
that what needs to go here is the total number of times that interest has been

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.778
compounded. It's compounded n times for every t years. So, that means that the

00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:49.153
total number of compoundings is just nt. There we go, we have a formula that

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:53.709
should be pretty easy to use. And I hope, more than anything else, that this

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:55.020
makes sense.
