00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.564
The quantity 4x plus 5 squared is correct. Fantastic work if you got that one

00:00:05.564 --> 00:00:09.670
right. We can see that this expression fits this first factoring pattern. We

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.428
have a perfect square trinomial. The first term is a perfect square, a 4x

00:00:13.428 --> 00:00:18.044
squared, and the last term is a perfect square, a 5 squared. So the a term is

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:24.850
really 4x and the b term is really 5. So to write my factor form, I simply write

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.163
4x plus 5 and then square it.
