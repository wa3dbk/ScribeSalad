00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.930
Let's first understand how the login process

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.689
works? You walk up to a workstation and

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.939
you login. And how do you login? Well

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.860
you login using your username and password and

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.790
this login process is special that runs on

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.220
the virtue workstation. It, communicates with the login

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.020
server that is inside the vice by presenting

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.860
the username and password in a secure fashion.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.270
We'll see how that is done in a bit. So it presents the username and password

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.930
securely over the insecure links. To the login server, and the login

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.170
server, once it authenticates who you are, using the username and

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.760
password, it is going to send you a pair of tokens, and remember all of this is

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.950
happening on behalf of the user by This

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.550
merge in the virtual workstation. The user has

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.830
to do nothing special. All that the user

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.820
is doing is logging in using a user

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.420
name and password. Under the covers these things are

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.520
happening. First, the log in process communicates securely

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.160
with the log in server presenting the user

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.800
name and password. And the login server then

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.940
returns two tokens. One is called a secret token.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.250
The other is called a clear token. The clear

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.860
token, is a data structure. Once again I have

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.900
to mention that both the secret and clear tokens

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.700
are communicated back To the log in process, by

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.420
the log in server, in a secure manner over

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.470
the insecure link. We'll see how that is done

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.160
in a minute. So once, the log in process

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.960
gets these two tokens, decrypts them and gets these two

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.220
tokens, the log in process decrypts the

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.800
message that contains these two tokens. And

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.030
extracts the clear token and the secret token. The clear token is really a data

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.580
structure which is known to the login

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.180
process. And the data structure in particular

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.600
contains a handshake key. We'll call it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.320
HKC. So from this clear token data structure,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.520
the login process can extract this handshake key

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.600
And the secret token is just a bit

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.910
string. So far as the login process is

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.910
concerned. The weight is generated by the login server,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.030
is to encrypt this clear token. With a key known only to vice. It's not the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.050
same as HKC. It is a key that is known only to vice, to encrypt the clear token.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.930
And we will see how this key is going to be used, later on. So to recap,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.110
virtue sends securely the username and password to the login server. Login

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.020
server securely sends secret token and clear

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.520
token back to this login process. From

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.630
the clear token The login process extracts

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.320
the handshake key. And the secret token is

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.430
basically a bitstream, which is an encryption

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.260
of the contents of this cleared token,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.500
encrypted with a key that is known only to Vice. In other words, the secrettoken

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.470
is unique for this login session, and It is a bit string, which means

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.530
nothing to anybody that sees it on the wire. And therefore we can use this bit

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.275
string that secrettoken represents as ephemeral

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:33.020
client-id for this login session. Recall I said. We don't

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.360
want to expose the user name and password Too often on the wire.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.340
This is Andrew's answer to dealing with a problem, by

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.790
providing an ephemeral client ID for this login session. Once

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.410
I use it as logged in, they get an ephemeral client ID, which is the secret

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.740
token. And this can be used in the future communication between

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.830
virtual And vice as the client ID. Now, how

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.970
will vice know who is communicating with it when it sees this

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.850
bit pattern? Remember that this bit pattern secret token is an an

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.230
encryption of the clear token. And the key for decrypting it is know only to

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.910
vice. So when the secret token comes as the client ID, vice can decrypt it

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.370
and find out from that, what is

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.420
the clear token associated with that particular bit

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.290
stream which is representing the secret token. And

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.100
once it knows that, it can also extract

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.280
the handshake key that it gave to particular client, and that's how the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.800
identity of the client that is communicating with the vice in the future,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.970
presenting this secret token as the ephemeral client ID can

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.840
be recognized by vice. So now, after the login is

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.430
done, for all the future communication between Venus and

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:12.310
Vice, HKC can be used as a private key for establishing a new RPC session. This

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.780
pair of tokens, the secret token and clear

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.890
token, is stored on the Virtue workstation by

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.500
Venus. On behalf of this user for the entire login session. At the end of this

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.860
login session, these two tokens will be thrown

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.730
away by Venus. But during the login session,

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.400
these two tokens are representing this particular

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.210
that has logged in. And, so for the

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.710
duration of this login session. Venus will use

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.230
the secret token, which is a bit string

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.210
that represents this particular user for this log

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.240
in session, as the client ID to send

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.220
information over to the vice. And, any information

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.880
that Venus sends to vice to establish an

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.000
RPC session is going to be. Encoded, with the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.460
private key that it had been handed now through the clear token data structure.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.030
That is the handshake key that had been given as part of

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.180
this log in exchange, through the clear token data structure. At the

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.160
core of the entire secure RPC system of. The

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.030
Andrew file system is the bind mechanism, for setting up a client

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.380
server connection securely, and that's what we're going to look at next.
