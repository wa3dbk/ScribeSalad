00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.907
We have x plus 1 equals plus or minus the square root of 13 over 3. Now, you may

00:00:03.907 --> 00:00:07.933
we wondering why it doesn't look like I took the positive and negative versions

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:11.810
of the square root of the left side of the equation. But with this equation

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.890
right here, we're actually covering all of our possible solutions for x. Here's

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.843
why. We know that if we have a square root of a number, and we make that

00:00:20.843 --> 00:00:24.878
negative. Then that's just equal to negative 1 times the square root of that

00:00:24.878 --> 00:00:29.169
number. The negative version of this square root effects would then be negative

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.116
1 times that. Which is negative x minus 1. Let's say that we had this in an

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:36.934
equation as well, with the same thing on the right side. They're more

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:41.005
effectively taking care of the plus and minus versions of the left root. This is

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:45.092
going to give us four different equations, which are these four equations right

00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:49.253
here. However, we need to notice something special about these equations. If we

00:00:49.253 --> 00:00:53.159
take this equation, negative x minus 1 equals negative root 13 over 3, and we

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.508
divide both sides by negative 1. We end up with x plus 1 equals the root of 13

00:00:57.508 --> 00:01:01.414
over 3, which is just this equation up here. That means that one of our

00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:05.702
equations in the second pair is the same as an equation in the first pair. Now

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:09.866
if we do the same thing for these 2 equations. The 2 we haven't touched on yet.

00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:13.949
We'd find that they are equivalent as well. So if we take the positive and

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:19.019
negative square roots of both sides of the equation, So it saves us some time to

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:23.836
only put the plus or minus in front of 1 side of the equation. And just take the

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:27.730
positive square root of the other side. Or the negative 1 if you prefer that.
