00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.320
Here in the US, the PCP as
gatekeeper is almost always used by

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.420
Health Maintenance Organizations or
HMOs.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.350
There is data to show that this provides
better care quality at a lower cost.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.970
Because of their key role in
coordinating care, HMO physicians almost

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.840
always have electronic patient
records and have for some time now.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.880
However, HMO's also almost always
provide a more limited choice of

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.420
physicians as a means of cost control
and to facilitate managing care quality.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.460
Marla, like many Americans,
gets Health Insurance from her employer.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.290
At work,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.370
she didn't select an HMO mostly because
she wanted a wider physician selection.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.050
And she didn't like the idea
of someone deciding for

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.520
her if she needed specialty care.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.160
She preferred to do that herself.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.050
As a result, she doesn't have a PCP, and

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.390
gets all of her care
from many specialists.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.540
Each of whom focuses on the problem
she has that is in their domain.
