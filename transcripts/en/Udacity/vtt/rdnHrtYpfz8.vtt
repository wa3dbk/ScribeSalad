00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.469
So let's see an example
of false sharing.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.150
Let's say that these are two memory
blocks, Block zero and Block one.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.540
The words in Block zero will be A,
B, C, and D.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.980
So, for example, this is a 16 byte
block that has four, four byte words.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.760
And the words in Block one are X,
Y, Z, and W.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.080
So which of these execution
fragments have false sharing misses?

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.250
If these axises happen,
are there any false sharing misses?

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.300
If these axises happen,
are there any false sharing misses?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.830
And if these axises happen,
are there any false sharing misses?
