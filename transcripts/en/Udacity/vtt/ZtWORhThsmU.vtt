00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.569
Let's go through these 1 by 1. So first, x cubed plus 6y squared. We want to

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.637
start by finding the degree of each term. So the degree of this first one is 3

00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:14.842
and the second term is 2. Since we have exponents of 3 and 2, respectively. 3 is

00:00:14.854 --> 00:00:21.086
greater than 2. So this is a third degree polynomial. Next 7 minus 3x plus 8x

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:30.008
cubed y. You have degrees of 0, 1, and 4 since we have 3 plus the invisible 1 on

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:34.345
this y equals 4. 4 is definitely the largest of these three numbers so this

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:38.795
polynomial is of degree 4. So we can do the same thing for the last two

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:41.971
polynomials as well. One interesting thing to note is that the degree of a

00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:46.033
polynomial is usually information that comes from just one term in the

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:50.234
expression, the term with the highest degree. But in some cases, like in this

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:53.997
last example, might have more than one term that's of the same degree. So for

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.996
example, here we have x squared which is a second degree term and z squared

00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:02.262
which is also a second degree term. Having 2 terms of the same degree. Doesn't

00:01:02.274 --> 00:01:06.261
change what the highest degree we see here is. We just happen to see that

00:01:06.273 --> 00:01:10.504
highest degree twice. We still follow the typical rule and say that this is a

00:01:10.516 --> 00:01:11.763
polynomial of degree 2.
