00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.310
The answer is that MIP level 1 will also have no real bumps left, so the ridges

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.560
will disappear. The two normals in each case will cancel out and the surface

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.370
will look flat. This is the problem with normal maps, that they disappear when

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.460
filtering is done. There are approaches that have been developed to help

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.500
improve this situation, but MIP mapping itself is often not done on normal maps

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.125
because of this problem.
