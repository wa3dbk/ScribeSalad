00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.460
Today we'll talk about one of the most ubiquitous problems in AI called

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.500
classification. Classification is mapping sets of percepts in the world into

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.810
equals classes, so that we can take actions in the world in an efficient manner.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.630
We could learn this concept through incremental concept learning.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.070
We'll talk about the nature of these equivalence classes and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.940
how they can be organized into a hierarchy of concepts. We'll talk about

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.049
different kinds of concepts, like axiomatic concepts and prototypical concepts.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.880
Given a classification hierarchy, we'll talk about multiple processes for

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.584
doing the classification, including both bottom-up and top-down processes.
