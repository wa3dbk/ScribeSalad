00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.616
This matrix is a translation matrix. Because only this fourth column is

00:00:03.616 --> 00:00:07.270
different than the identity matrix. These values are the translation amounts.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.220
This matrix is a rotation matrix. Because the upper left three by three has been

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.146
modified, and not in a simple way like a scaling matrix. I should mention that

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:18.794
if the three by three areas change in a arbitrary way you can get what is called

00:00:18.794 --> 00:00:22.616
a sheer matrix. I see sheer matrices get mentioned in textbooks, hey, we cover

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:26.596
them in our own book. But personally in the past three decades I've never used a

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:30.306
sheer matrix. This matrix has elements of both translation and rotation and so

00:00:30.306 --> 00:00:34.414
is the two of these types multiplied together. This leaves the last matrix as a

00:00:34.414 --> 00:00:38.209
scaling matrix, it's a non-uniform scaling along each axis.
