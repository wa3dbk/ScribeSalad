If you chose the circle, great work. I know I have 1 part of the circle shaded

00:00:04.393 --> 00:00:09.089
out of 5 equal parts. So, that's definitely 1/5. The second one isn't 1/4. I do

00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:13.357
have 5 parts but they're not all equal. I have 1 of them shaded but remember,

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:17.788
the parts need to be equal. This one is also correct. I have 1 out of 5 pieces

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.245
and all the pieces are equally shaped. This triangle is also not correct. I do

00:00:22.257 --> 00:00:26.916
have 1 piece shaded, but I have 1 of 4. So this one is really 1/4. This one is

00:00:26.928 --> 00:00:31.601
also correct. I have 5 pieces of my entire rectangle and I have one of them

00:00:31.613 --> 00:00:36.670
shaded, so 1/5. This one is also not correct. I have 5 pieces, but they're not

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:41.756
equally shaped. The area hasn't been divided into 5 equal pieces, so this can't

00:00:41.768 --> 00:00:42.971
be 1/5 of the area
