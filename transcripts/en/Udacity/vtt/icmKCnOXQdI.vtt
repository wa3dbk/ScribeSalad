00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.127
To do this, we use the t-statistic that you calculated already, .96 squared

00:00:05.127 --> 00:00:12.112
divided by .96 squared plus the degrees of freedom, which is 6 plus 10. This

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:17.586
comes out to 0.054 approximately. This means that only about 5%, or 5.4% of the

00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:26.006
difference in pairs of shoes owned is due to gender. The other 95% is can be

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:30.846
explained by something else. We're not sure what it is, we would have to do

00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:35.408
additional statistical tests to figure that out. But, for example, it could be

00:00:35.408 --> 00:00:39.758
individual personalities. Some people would rather spend more of their money on

00:00:39.758 --> 00:00:45.500
shoes, or maybe people who are more outgoing need more shoes. Who knows.
