The midpoint is located right here. The coordinates of that point are 100 and

00:00:04.507 --> 00:00:08.738
350. When I figured this out the first time, I basically eyeballed where I

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.271
thought halfway along the line was, and then figure out the coordinates of that

00:00:13.283 --> 00:00:17.659
point. But is there a way that we can use the coordinates of the two points on

00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:22.096
the line that we already know to find the coordinates of the point halfway

00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:26.390
between them? In fact, there is. We know that home is located at 0,0, the

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:30.919
origin, and the Udacity is located at 200 700,. Going halfway between these

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:35.063
points, means going both halfway in the x-direction and halfway in the

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:39.442
y-direction. So, let's look at those coordinates individually. For the

00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:43.588
x-coordinate, we start at 0 and we want to go halfway to 200, half of the

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.709
distance between 0 and 200 is 100. So, you just go over that much. That

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:52.415
automatically gives us our x-coordinate. The y-coordinate works in pretty much

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:56.900
the same way. Our initial y-coordinate of home is 0, we want to go up 700, to

00:00:56.912 --> 00:01:04.175
where Udacity located vertically. This distance is 700 miles, so half of 700 is

00:01:04.187 --> 00:01:04.575
350.
