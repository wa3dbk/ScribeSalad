00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.590
One example of a programming language that sits on top of such a north-bound API

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.880
is Frenetic, which is a SQL-Like query language. For example, Frenetic would

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.390
allow a programmer to count the number

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.930
of bytes, grouped by destination Mac address

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.870
and report the updates to these counters

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.360
every 60 seconds. The group by statement.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.790
The group by statement allows a grouping

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.570
of counts by the destination mac address. Where

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.310
allows restrictions to only count trafic coming from

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.520
a web server coming in on a particular

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.590
port and every specifies that the results of

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.960
this query should only be returned every 60

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.415
seconds. More information about Frenetic is available at

00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:50.470
frenetic-lang.org. And in the course, we'll actually going

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.760
to use a language called Pyretic that is based on the

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.920
same underlying theory as Frenetic, except that it's embedded in Python.
