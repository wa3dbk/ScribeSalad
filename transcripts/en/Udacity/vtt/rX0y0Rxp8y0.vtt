00:00:00.308 --> 00:00:03.490
Previously, we have just been setting
the position of objects based

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.520
on how much time has elapsed.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.500
Basically, the x position is
some function of time, and

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.300
the y position is some
other function of time.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.500
More interesting, however, is to set
the position of objects based on

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.390
their position in the previous
frame using their velocity.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.300
If we just do that,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.190
however, we just get motion at
a constant speed in a straight line.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.630
To get really interesting motion,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.370
we need to take into account
acceleration as well.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.470
Acceleration is the change
in velocity over time.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.270
Let's take the simple
case of a falling object.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.450
Let's say we've got some
object in freefall.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.390
And last frame, its position was x and
y, and its velocity was vX and vY.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.220
To figure out where it
will be this frame,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.750
we first need to update its velocity.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.660
vX will be unchanged since gravity
is only acting vertically.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.730
To find its new vertical velocity,
we need to add the elapsed time of this

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.150
frame, multiply it by
the acceleration due to gravity.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.420
We can then use these new velocities
to update the position of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.810
the following object.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.620
In the next exercise,
we'll see these equations in action.
