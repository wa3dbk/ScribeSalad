00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.760
The only prior knowledge you need for

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.900
this lesson is a familiarity with the
basics of graphs and graph traverses.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.030
You should know what a graph is and
the difference between directed and

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.940
undirected graphs.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.990
You should be familiar with the common
vocabulary surrounding graphs

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.670
such as vertex degree.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.799
The ideas of neighbors and
neighborhoods and paths in graphs.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.870
And we will also assume that you are
familiar with the basic graph traversal

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.470
algorithms like Depth-first search and
Breadth-first search and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.040
their running times.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.290
The plan for the lesson is this.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.630
We begin by introducing the necessary
definitions for a flow network,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.070
flow capacities, and residual networks,
and residual capacities.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.750
Then, we present
the Ford-Fulkerson method, and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.630
show that it finds a maximum flow with
the help of a theorem that shows that

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.110
the maximum flow in a network is
actually equal to the minimum cut.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.160
Finally, we discuss two variations on
the Ford-Fulkerson method, showing

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.790
that these algorithms make it much more
efficient than a naive version would be.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.090
This lecture will follow most closely
the treatment in Kleinberg and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.720
Tardos, Algorithm Design, but any
reference on the subject should suffice.
