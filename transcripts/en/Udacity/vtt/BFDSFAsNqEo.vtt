00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.149
We want to start by looking for our Greatest Common Factor and what do you know

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.451
all the coefficients are even, so 2 can come out. Now that we factored out a 2,

00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:13.338
we want to continue factoring this inside portion if possible. We want to find

00:00:13.338 --> 00:00:18.722
factors of positive 14 and some to negative 15. This 14 comes from multiplying

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:23.862
the coefficient of the x squared term 2 by the constant term 7. The negative 15

00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:28.998
is simply the coefficient of our x term. We have a positive 14 and a negative

00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:33.690
15. This must mean every factor in a factor pair must be negative. We want to

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.730
use negative 1 and negative 14 since they multiply to give us positive 14 and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.246
they add to negative 15. We continue factoring this portion by rewriting the

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:47.426
middle term with these two factors as coefficients for x. Then we factor by

00:00:47.426 --> 00:00:51.498
grouping. We take out an x from the first two terms and a negative 7 from the

00:00:51.498 --> 00:00:56.078
second two terms. When I remove a negative 7 from positive 7, I'm left with

00:00:56.078 --> 00:01:01.450
negative 1 here. I also know I did this step correctly, since negative 7 times

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.657
2x is negative 14x. And negative 7 times negative 1 is positive 7. We have a

00:01:06.657 --> 00:01:11.563
common factor of 2x minus 1. So this is our completed factor form. Fantastic

00:01:11.563 --> 00:01:13.513
work, if you got that correct.
