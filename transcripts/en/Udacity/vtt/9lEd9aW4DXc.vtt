00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.300
This one would have been 5 times the square root of 3. Great work if you

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.569
figured that one out. We know 75 is the same thing as 25 times 3. We want to

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.522
make sure that we split this up into factors where one of the factors is a

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:16.449
perfect square. This allows us to use our product rule and then to take the

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.110
square root of this one. So we use the product rule in this step, and then we

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.760
take the square root of 25 which is just 5. We're left with 5 times the square

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.228
root of 3, which is just equal to 5 root 3. And notice that we make another

00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:33.667
assumption. If we write a number in front of a radical sign, we assume there's

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:38.662
multiplication in between them. So here's our answer.
