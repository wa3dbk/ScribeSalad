00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.756
The correlation coefficient now goes down to 0.231, which is a lot lower than

00:00:04.756 --> 00:00:12.004
this one. As you can see, r is sensitive to outliers just like the mean is. In

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:16.441
other words, outliers can dramatically change the value of r. That's why it's

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:20.662
important to look at data with a critical eye and think, what is causing this

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:27.420
outlier to be there? Should we include it in the measurement of our statistics?

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.980
Remember how before, when we created box plots, we looked at just the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.340
interquartile range, and outliers weren't used in the actual box-and-whisker

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.251
plot. They were drawn as circles on the outside. Kind of like this. Sometimes

00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:48.167
it's good to take outliers into account. Other times, you want to see the trend

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:49.749
of the data without them.
