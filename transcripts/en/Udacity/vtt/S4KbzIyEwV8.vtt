00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.892
&gt;&gt; Unlike the mode, the mean take all values into account because we add them

00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:09.745
all up, then we divide by how many values there are. And just to remember, we

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:14.636
pretty much always write these calculations as decimals when we don't get whole

00:00:14.636 --> 00:00:19.436
numbers. So, I'm going to calculate the mean for Nursing. And remember, mean is

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:24.682
often represented by x bar. So, the mean is 58,350 plus all the rest of the

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:30.633
values in the column divided by 5, because there are 5 values. And when we do

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:36.744
that, we get that the mean salary for Nursing, from these values at least, is

00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:42.758
58,948. So now, find the mean salary for the five Geography majors. I'll call

00:00:42.758 --> 00:00:47.370
this x bar sub geo, for Geography. Write your answer in the box.
