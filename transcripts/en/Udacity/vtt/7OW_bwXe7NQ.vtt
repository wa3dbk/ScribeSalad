00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.328
So the last type of combine approach that we will discuss and that has seen an

00:00:04.328 --> 00:00:07.632
increase in both research and in practice is mindfulness training and

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:13.950
psychotherapy. Specifically, mindfulness based cognitive therapy or MBCT is an

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.558
approach that combines elements of both cognitive behavioral therapy with

00:00:18.558 --> 00:00:23.454
mindfulness meditation to help people with depression for instance, to learn to

00:00:23.454 --> 00:00:30.597
recognize and restructure negative thought patterns. This therapy uses both

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:35.008
mindfulness meditation and cognitive therapy to restructure one's thoughts. So

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:38.848
mindfulness meditation develops skills for approaching thoughts in a

00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:42.944
non-judgmental way, and enhances people's ability to realize that they are

00:00:42.944 --> 00:00:47.168
neither bound nor defined by their thoughts, feelings, and sensations, and to

00:00:47.168 --> 00:00:54.330
detect symptoms before they become a problem. So this approach has been used

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.948
successfully in preventing the relapse in depression, and in addition there's

00:00:57.948 --> 00:01:01.512
some research to show that mindfulness based meditation therapy has been used

00:01:01.512 --> 00:01:07.346
successfully in treating positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The

00:01:07.346 --> 00:01:10.262
idea here is that this therapy can be used by teaching people with

00:01:10.262 --> 00:01:13.718
schizophrenia to learn to live more easily with their symptoms, and to not be

00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:18.799
defined or controlled by them. One new approach focuses on changing the

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.417
relationship that people have with the voices in their heads rather than trying

00:01:22.417 --> 00:01:27.425
to make those voices go away. Some early studies have shown that this technique

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:31.151
results in less distress and improved functioning after training in mindfulness

00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:35.970
meditation. So if you're interested in trying meditaion, take a look in the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.501
instructor's note box. We've provided you with a link to more information about

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.585
mindfulness meditation.
