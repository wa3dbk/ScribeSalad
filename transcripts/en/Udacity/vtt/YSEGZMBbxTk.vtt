00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.920
As we saw with the OpenStreetMap data,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.400
XML tags often contain attribute name value pairs.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.950
One example of attributes in this data set

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.580
is the iid attribute of this institutional relationship

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.580
tag, or insr tag. The iid value here

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.040
actually defines a relationship between an author and

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.310
institutions with which they are affiliated. Institutions appear

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.300
later in this institution group, here, as individual

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.860
elements of their own. Now in the last

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.080
exercise we ignored these insr tags. Let's address

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.310
them here. We're going to update our solution

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.620
to the last exercise to use the data

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.330
in these insr tags. See the code I've

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.790
provided. However, rather than an insr field in

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.330
your author dictionaries, store an iid field for

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.360
each author. Note that some authors will have

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.510
multiple insr tags. The value for the iid field then for

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.620
authors needs to be an array composed of all the iids for a given author. For

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.290
each author, create an iid field. Note

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.250
that some authors are actually affiliated with

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.930
multiple institutions, so the value for your iid fields needs to be an array.
