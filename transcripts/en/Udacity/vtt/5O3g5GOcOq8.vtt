00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's first have a look at the output.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You see that with rates of 20,000 and 50,000 tons per year, we do not seem to be over fishing.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
However, with rates of 100,000 and 200,000 tons per year,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we clearly are over fishing, fish go extinct.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The line of code that actually implements the forward Euler method

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is produced straightforward.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The harder part is to stop harvesting and this solution is as follows--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we check whether or not the amount of fish for the next step is equal to zero or negative.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If so, we set a flag that tells us whether I should be using zero

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for the amount of fishing in all upcoming steps.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Note that you cannot simply check whether the amount of fish for the next step

00:00:50.000 --> 09:59:59.000
is exactly equal to zero--that's probably not going to happen.
