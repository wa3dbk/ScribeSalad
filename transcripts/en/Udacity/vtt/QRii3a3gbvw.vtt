00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.855
Now that we have our given information and the goal of our problem laid out

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:07.761
explicitly, we can work toward creating and equation to help describe the

00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:11.740
situation. I'd like you to use these quantities down here to create a word

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.617
equation in these blanks. I've made things a little bit easier for you and

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:19.871
filled in operators already. So please, in each of these blanks, put the letter

00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:23.428
of the quantity down here that you think belongs in that position.
