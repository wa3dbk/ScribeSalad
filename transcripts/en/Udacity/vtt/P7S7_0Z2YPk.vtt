00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.680
At this point, you should have your API key for the New York Times.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.973
You're ready to start grabbing some headlines and

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:07.685
the opening paragraphs to articles.

00:00:07.685 --> 00:00:11.586
Your code is going to be going inside the same loadData function as before.

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:18.420
You'll use using the jQuery $.getJSON method to make this AJAX request.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.970
It's your job to write the code that makes the AJAX request.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.220
Once the data has been returned from the AJAX request, you'll need to parse it,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.220
and then figure out how to present it on the page.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.650
The link in the instructor notes will take you to the getJSON documentation on

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.320
the jQuery website.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.580
I recommend checking out this first example to get an idea for

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.150
what your code should do.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.480
Let's open up Dev tools and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.170
inspect this page so you can get an idea of what your HTML should look like.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.850
Opening up the first article, we see that it contains an a tag to a link for

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.150
the article, and

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.100
it also contains a p tag with the text of the first paragraph inside.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.500
In the example, we're passing in a URL string of ajax/test.json.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.230
This could be any URL.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.270
And, we also pass in an anonymous function.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.459
This anonymous function,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:09.620
pass to getJSON, will be run when the response returns from the server.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.560
Each article is in a list tag and

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.710
they all fall within an unsigned list with the ID of nytimes-articles.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.470
I recommend starting off by console.logging the data that gets returned from

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.100
this JSON request.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.720
You'll need to break it apart before you can start building articles.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.550
So, can you make an AJAX request to the NY Times API and

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.530
get some articles about the city?

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.770
You'll need to fire off the AJAX request, iterate through the response and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.950
then present articles on the page inside the ul with an id of nytimes-articles.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.920
Check this box when you're done.
