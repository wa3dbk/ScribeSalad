00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.300
Remember, that through protocols,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.430
views are able to ask a series
of questions of their delegates.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.360
Protocol method invocations
begin in the view, and

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.250
call upon a control object,
which is often a view controller.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.210
Table views are considerably more
complicated than text fields, in fact,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.390
tables use not one, but two protocols.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.100
One of those protocols has 33 methods,
and the other has 11.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.310
Tables are a cornerstone of UIKit and
they're very customizable.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.440
That's the huge method count.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.760
We're not going to go through
all 44 methods now though.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.230
It turns out not every method in
a delegate protocol is essential.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.160
So, we'll focus on
the most important first.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.580
Is it true that some protocol
methods get used more than others?

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.450
Think about the UI text field delegate,
and then answer the quiz question.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.690
Which method did we use the most
to customize the text fields?
