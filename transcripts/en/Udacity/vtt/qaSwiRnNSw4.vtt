00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this problem, we've been tasked with modifying code we built in lecture

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that simulates deterministic finite state machines to also simulate

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
non-deterministic finite state machines, so as a quick review,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
what makes a non-deterministic finite state machine different

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
than a deterministic one?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
One thing is that a non-deterministic state machine

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
may have epsilon transitions, which means transitions

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that don't require any characters in the string

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and are taken automatically.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The other difference is that a non-deterministic machine

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
may have 2 output edges that correspond to the same letter,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and this causes diverging states.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Simulating a string on a machine,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the machine can be in multiple states at the same time,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and so that's really the key, what we're going to have to modify for this problem

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
since we were told explicitly we do not have to worry about the epsilon transitions.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The first thing we may want to go over is the notation

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in Python code for our machine.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
In the example, you were given a dictionary edges,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
so the keys in our dictionary indicates the state in our state machine,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and the values are the other states to whom the key has an outgoing edge

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
labeled with the second value in the tuple of the key.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That may sound a bit confusing, so let's work through and draw a diagram

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
for what this Python description represents.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Let's say we always begin at state 1, which will hold true for the remainder of our examples.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Here we begin at state 1.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We then have 2 outgoing edges to states 2 and 3,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and those are labeled with the letter a.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
From state 2, we have 1 outgoing edge to state 2

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
labeled with the letter a.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
From state 3, we have 2 outgoing edges to 3 and 4

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
labeled with the letter b, and from 4,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we have 1 outgoing edge to state 5 labeled with the letter c.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And lastly, we have our accepting states 2 and 5,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
so we'll use the notation of a double circle to indicate that it's an accepting state,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and this is the finite state machine that this description represents.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
If you're a little rusty on your non-deterministic finite automata,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
let's go through an example string and see whether or not it's accepted.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Let's say we have the string a, a, a.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We start at state 1.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
From 1 we take the letter a to both 2 and 3.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We're in two places at the same time.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
At 2, we take the letter a back to 2.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
At 3, there are no transitions for the letter a,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
so in this version of our simulation, this alternative dimension,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
however you want to think about it, the finite state machine

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
has failed to accept the string.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
However, we still have the other version of the simulation.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
We take the last a back to 2,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and from here we've succeeded,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and by our definition of the non-determinism,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
if any path through this state machine results in an accepting state,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
then we say this machine accepts that string.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Okay, let's do this once more.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Here we have the string a, b, b, c.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
From a we go to 2 states, 2 and 3.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Then we have the letter b.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
From state 2 there's nothing we can do.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
From state 3 we have 2 outgoing edges with b,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so we're now at 3 and 4.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Oh, and I forgot to include this last state transition, c,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
which will come up in a bit.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
From 3 we take another b to both 3 and 4,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and from 4, there's nowhere to take this b to, so we've failed.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And lastly we have a c.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
From state 3, there's nowhere to take this c,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
but from 4 we can take the c to 5,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
which is an accepting state.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Now you hopefully feel pretty good with stepping through

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
a non-deterministic finite state machine.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Now we have to actually answer the question, and that is to simulate it.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And what we're going to do is pretty much what we did by hand.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We're going to do it recursively.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We're going to start from the starting state,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and we're going to take the first character in our string

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and recurse on this state that that edge leads to,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
so at 1 we're going to take the a and recurse onto 2

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
with the rest of the string and onto 3 for the rest of the string.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And if any of those recursions, those recursive calls,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
come back true, then we say beginning at state 1,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
we return true, and it's going to go all the way back up.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Let's try writing that.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Here we have our procedure, the non-deterministic finite state machine simulator--

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I know that's a mouthful--and we take in 4 parameters,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the string on which we're simulating, the current state,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
the map of edges that represents the state machine,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and lastly, a list of the accepting states.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I mentioned before we're going to do this via recursion,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and one of the first things you may want to think about when you're writing

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
a recursive procedure is your base case.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Our base case is going to happen when we have no more characters left in our string.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So if I have no more characters, we're simply going to return whether or not

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
we are currently in an accepting state,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and thanks to the nice Python syntax, that translates almost exactly to the code.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Otherwise we're going to look at the first character in our string.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
If the current state has an outgoing edge with a letter that's

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
the first character in the string, we're going to do a recursive call for each edge.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Here I've written the code that gets out the new state,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and the last thing we need to decide is what to do with what

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
the recursive call returns.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And as I said earlier, we're going to return true

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
if any of the recursive calls that we make return true.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
If we go through all of this mess, or if there wasn't an edge for the current letter

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
at our present state, we're going to return false,

00:05:59.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and that's the code.
