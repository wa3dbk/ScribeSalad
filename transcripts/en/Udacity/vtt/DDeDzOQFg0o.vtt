00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.337
Once you start looking under the hood, you'll get some sense of the lay of the

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:06.769
land with matrices and how they relate to transforms. Here's a map of the sort

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.246
of things you'll find. The upper left area of the matrix is where rotations and

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:15.963
scales show up. If a transform changes only this area of the matrix, it's called

00:00:15.963 --> 00:00:19.985
a linear transformation. I'm not going to spend time on the formal definition of

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:24.214
this term. The additional course materials include resources for more on the

00:00:24.214 --> 00:00:28.010
underlying math. The definition is fairly basic stuff about how addition and

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.894
multiplication are preserved. But doesn't have much effect on how we actually do

00:00:31.894 --> 00:00:36.060
computer graphics. The upper right is where the translations accumulate. These

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.544
translation values will get effected by multiplication with other matrices of

00:00:39.544 --> 00:00:43.896
course. Translations only effect points since vectors have zero for their fourth

00:00:43.896 --> 00:00:49.008
coordinate. 3JS provides a function called decompose to extract the translation,

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:53.871
rotation and scale factors from a matrix. The translation and scale factors come

00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:58.557
back as vectors, as you might expect. The rotation comes back as a quaternion.

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:02.874
Something we'll talk about when we get to animation. The short version is that a

00:01:02.874 --> 00:01:07.122
quaternion is a compact way to store the axis and angle of rotation for a

00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:11.707
rotation matrix. One useful property quarternions have is that you can easily

00:01:11.707 --> 00:01:15.861
interpolate between them, which is useful for interpolating between two

00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:20.100
different orientation. Notice that the bottom row is always 0, 0, 0 1. The

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.597
transforms we covered here are called affine transforms. Parallel lines stay

00:01:24.597 --> 00:01:29.703
parallel when an affine transform is applied. In modeling you'll essentially

00:01:29.703 --> 00:01:34.304
always use affine transforms. So we never change this last row. Since GPUs are

00:01:34.304 --> 00:01:39.104
tuned to use four by four matrices Most of us just use four by fours everywhere

00:01:39.104 --> 00:01:43.579
for simplicites sake. When we discuss perspective cameras, we'll set the values

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.230
in this last row. We'll then be using a projective transform. With affine

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.523
transforms, when a points coordinates are multipied by the matrix. The fourth

00:01:52.523 --> 00:01:56.452
coordinate starts out as one and ends up as one. This last row in a projection

00:01:56.452 --> 00:02:00.324
matrix modifies that fourth coordinate to be something other than one. What that

00:02:00.324 --> 00:02:03.623
means is something we'll leave til a later lesson.
