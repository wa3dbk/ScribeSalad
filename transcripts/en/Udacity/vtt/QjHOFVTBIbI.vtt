00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.774
Here are some solutions to the problem just outlined. The drawing the red

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:08.328
transparent object first causes the blue object to not be seen by the camera and

00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:12.917
blended in properly. Which of these solutions will solve this particular case?

00:00:12.918 --> 00:00:17.400
More than one answer can be correct. First is, draw all objects sorted by size,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.042
small to large. Draw all objects sorted back to front order. Draw all objects as

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:27.081
if they're all transparent, blending each one. And finally, draw the fully

00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:30.474
opaque objects first, transparent later.
