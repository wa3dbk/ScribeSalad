00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.193
Psychologists look at stress with two different vantage points. Stress as a

00:00:04.193 --> 00:00:09.546
stimulus and stress as a response. First, we have stress as a stimulus. This

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:14.388
looks at stress as the result of a particular stimulus. Here we're saying that

00:00:14.388 --> 00:00:19.282
stress is the result of a stressor. In other words, an event that triggers

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:24.190
stress. In the example we discussed earlier, the stressor could be the ten page

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.178
paper that needs to be written. Another example would be writing a check that

00:00:28.178 --> 00:00:30.984
you realize that you don't have the money in your bank account to cover, or

00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:35.423
getting in an argument with your roommate, or friend. Any of those things could

00:00:35.423 --> 00:00:41.830
be stressors. The idea here, is that a situation causes stress. The other

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.590
advantage point from which psychologists use stress is stress as a response.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.208
Here psychologists look at the physiological changes or reactions that happen

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:54.258
when we encounter a stressful situation. Think of this as what's happening

00:00:54.258 --> 00:00:59.270
inside of your body when we're stressed. Here, we'll see things that happen in

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.110
a body when we experience acute stress, as well as chronic long term exposure

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.445
to stress. Stress as a stimulus looks at what causes the stress and stress as a

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:15.161
response looks at how the body responds to stress, when we're stressed. But

00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:18.200
let's go to Susan to start with examining stress as a stimulus.
