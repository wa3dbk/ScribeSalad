00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.965
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know that either this factor needs to equal 0, or this factor needs to

00:00:03.965 --> 00:00:08.173
equal 0, to make this entire expression on the left side equal to 0. So that

00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:12.254
means we can either have the equation x minus 4 equals 0, or we can have the

00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:13.919
equation x minus 28 equals 0.
