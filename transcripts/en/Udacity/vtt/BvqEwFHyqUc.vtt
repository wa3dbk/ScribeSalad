00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.600
In the upcoming videos,
I'll be sharing user experiences and

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.810
talking about design decisions that
can influence your product and

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.210
your users' behaviors with the product.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.960
We'll examine some of the best and worst
examples of user experience, so you can

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.590
focus on the most important parts for
the development of your product.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.730
The goal of this is to expose
you to design considerations, so

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.830
you can address the biggest concerns
in the early stages of the product.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.150
At the end of this lesson, you'll be
equipped with ideas and resources for

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.800
conducting design sprints and
working with designers.
