00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.469
So let's get back to our Klout score example. Based on the fact that our sample

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:12.317
mean was 40 of everyone who used the Bieber Tweeter our population mean could

00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:19.525
range from 34.58 to 45.42. And we found that the original population mean 37.72,

00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:25.959
is well within this interval. Basically this means that a sample of size 35 with

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:31.622
a mean of 40 could have been selected by random chance. It's very possible. But

00:00:31.622 --> 00:00:37.544
what about in our second example from lesson 7 where we got a mean Klout score

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:42.749
of 40 again but with a sample size of 250. Now our sampling distribution becomes

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:48.962
a lot skinnier because we have a much bigger sample size. So this is about 1.01.

00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:54.282
So now if we a 95% confidence interval for what the mean Klout score would be if

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:59.677
everyone used the Bieber Tweeter, will the range be bigger or smaller than the

00:00:59.677 --> 00:01:02.972
one you calculated when the sample size was 35.
