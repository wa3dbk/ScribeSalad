00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.520
As you can see from Liz's story,
programming skills can impact anyone.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.520
As for my story, I became
interested in programming because I

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.580
thought it would enhance my
roles as a teacher and a dancer.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.890
But eventually, I came to a crossroads.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.320
I wasn't sure whether I wanted to
pursue a career as a programmer or

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.414
stay a teacher, so I decided to do both.

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:20.850
You may be at a similar
point in your journey.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.820
The next few lessons will explore
four specific careers within

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.600
the technology industry.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.770
There are certainly more paths
within the programming world,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.630
and you may even decide to
go in a different direction.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.900
In any case, every industry
is affected by technology.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.020
By having a better understanding of
what goes into computer programmers,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.580
you can shape the tools
that impact the world.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.280
Let's follow Anthony on his journey
through the world of programming.
