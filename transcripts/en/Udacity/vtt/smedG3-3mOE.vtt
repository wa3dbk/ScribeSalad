00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.506
The correct answer is 0.50. Remember, Cohen's d is given by this formula. So we

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.800
take our sample mean, subtract the population mean, divide by the center

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.282
deviation for the sample. So we get negative 25 over 50, which gives us

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:20.587
negative 0.5. This tells us that these two means are half a standard deviation

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:21.680
apart.
