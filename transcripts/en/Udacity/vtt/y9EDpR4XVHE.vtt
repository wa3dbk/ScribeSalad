00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Unfortunately, not all bugs resolve to nice assertion violation messages,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and bug disambiguation can be trickier when all we have

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is something like a core dump of a stack trace.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What these things are going to give is--at least if we have good debugging symbols--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
probably some sort of an indication of what part of the code failed,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and then it's going to give an indication of the stack frames leading up to the failure.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Sometimes these are going to be useful for doing disambiguation and sometimes not.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
They provide qualitatively at some level similar information to assertion violation messages,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and if they're giving us some clues relating the symptom to the source code

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but is not going to be as easy to find and it's not going to be as readable.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
A third weapon we have in the arsenal when doing bug triage

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is actually pretty interesting,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which is that we can do a search over the revision history of the software under test--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that is to say, of course, if we have access to the revision control symptom we can do this.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Let's go back to our example here where we have all these bugs.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If it's the case that all of these bugs here appear just one revision back,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and these other ones appeared in different revisions maybe weeks or months ago

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
then it's a good bet that all of these new inputs are triggering the same error--

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that is to say, an error that somebody just committed the other day--

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and these probably trigger older bugs.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is a pretty powerful weapon and some automated tools for revision control

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
even build in functionality to do this search over version history.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
For example, git has a git_bisect command

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that can be used to do a binary search over revision history in an automated way.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Even if that kind of thing isn't available it's not too hard to script this up yourself

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
given an automated way to detect if a particular version has a particular bug.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Our last way we can triage bugs

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is to examine a test case.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Often it's the case that test cases that trigger the same bugs have similar features.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
In the compiler bug finding example that I've been using

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
it's often the case that I'll look at a bunch of failure-triggering programs--

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that is to say, inputs to the compiler that cause it to crash or otherwise fail--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and contains some sort of a smoking gun like maybe 64-bit integer divides or something like that.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
There would be some sort of common feature that tips us off

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that some collection of test inputs all maps to the same bug.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Then if we see another group of test inputs

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that contain some totally different feature-

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
maybe really deeply nested parentheses or really long identifiers--

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
then it's a good bet that those map to a different bug.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The problem is looking over large, randomly-generated test cases is really painful.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This is going to directly lead to our next topic,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
which is a really important one, which is test-case reduction or test-case minimization.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
That's an automated process for taking a large failure-inducing input

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and turning it into a small one, and we're going to cover that next.
