00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.500
For a long time, the Name Node was a single point

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.790
of failure in Hadoop. If it died, the entire cluster was

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.970
inaccessible. If the meta data on the Name Node was lost

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.930
completely, the entire cluster's data was lost. Sure, you've still got

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.700
all the blocks on the data nodes but you've no way

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.680
of knowing which block belongs to which file whithout the meta

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.430
data. So, to avoid the problem, people would configure the Name

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.940
Node to store meta data, not only on it's own hard drive

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.150
but also somewhere on a network file system. NFS

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.070
is a method of mounting a remote disk. That way,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.890
even if the Name Node bursts into flames, there

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.230
would be a copy of the metadata elsewhere on the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.772
network. These days, there's an even better alternative. The

00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:42.716
Name Node is not a single point of failure in

00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:46.160
most production clusters, because they've configured two Name Nodes.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.390
The active Name Node works as before, but the standby

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.800
can be configured to take over if the active one

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.020
fails. That way the cluster will keep running if any of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.590
the nodes, even one of the Name Nodes, fails. Ian's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.480
now going to show us a demonstration of how to use HDFS.
