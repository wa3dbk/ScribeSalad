00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So we're using these token definitions in regular expressions

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to break down HTML and JavaScript into important words.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
As we've seen before, there can be lots of extra space

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
between various tokens.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We really want to skip or pass over spaces

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and possibly newline characters and tabs.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
More on that later.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We do that using the same sort of token definition as before,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so here I've made a regular expression that just matches a single space,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but instead of returning the token, we pass it by.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This is the power.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let's test out our knowledge with a quiz.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We've already seen how to do left and right angle bracket sorts of tokens.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We've taken a look at strings before.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And now let's do words, which are almost everything else on a web page.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Let's say that we want a word to be any number of characters

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
except a left angle bracket, a right angle bracket,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or a space, and here I really mean the single character

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
pressing the space bar, not this 5-character word, but it's hard to write out.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And when you're writing your function to match word tokens,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
you should leave the value unchanged.

00:01:12.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Submit a definition for t_word using the interpreter.
