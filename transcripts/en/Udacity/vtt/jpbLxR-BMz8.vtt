00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.952
To get a sense of how involved it would be to track all the photons in a scene,

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:07.721
I want you to do a rough estimate. Say we have ten 40 watt light bulbs in a

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:12.587
room. As mentioned before, each produces 10 to the 19th photons per second.

00:00:12.588 --> 00:00:16.468
About a billion computers, 10 to the 9th are currently in use world wide. Say

00:00:16.468 --> 00:00:20.494
each computer can trace a million photons through a scene per second. This is an

00:00:20.494 --> 00:00:24.098
unrealistically high rate, since we're talking about tracing each photon until

00:00:24.098 --> 00:00:27.515
it is absorbed by an object or it reaches the camera. Your grandmother's

00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:31.742
computer likely can not do this. So, the question to you is how many earth's

00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:36.012
worth of computers would we need to trace all the photons in a scene in real

00:00:36.012 --> 00:00:40.596
time and so form an image? So, your choices are, we need just one earth's worth,

00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:45.012
ten earth's worth, one hundred earth's worth or ten million earth's worth of

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:46.953
computers to do this in real time.
