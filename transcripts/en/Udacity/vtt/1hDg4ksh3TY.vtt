00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.580
So we could that with two imports. We could also do it with just one line

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.425
listing the two with commas, and we would add this line to test.py. Usually

00:00:09.425 --> 00:00:12.690
we'll put the imports at the beginning of the file. If we did this where we

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.115
actually use things from the imported modules, but we would need to use

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:22.630
crawler.crawl_web instead of just crawl_web here. And instead of ordered search

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.000
for example, we would need to use search.orderedsearch. If there's a definition

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.120
in a module that we need to use frequently, we might not want to have to type

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.868
the module name before every time we use it. So there's a way to import names

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:38.538
from a module directly into our name space, and that's to use from. The syntax

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:42.568
is from, followed by the module name, import, and then the list of definitions

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:46.358
that we want to import from that module into our name space. So for this

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:50.358
example, we do from crawler import crawl_web, compute_ranks.
