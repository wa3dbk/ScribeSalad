00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.350
Here's another one for you to try out on your own. I've given you the number,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.756
the square root of 2 divided by the quantity negative 3 plus square root of 5.

00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:12.978
And I'd like you to rewrite this by first changing the denominator that is a

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:17.708
rational number, instead of having both rational and irrational components. And

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:21.203
then I'd like you to simplify the fraction as much as you can.
