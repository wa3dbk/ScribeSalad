00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.465
In this session,
we discussed variables and constants.

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:07.560
They're indeed two of the most basic
ingredients of any application.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.550
As you've seen, you can accomplish many
simple tasks using just the variables

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.370
and constants, but soon, you'll start
combining variables into larger

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.520
constructs to build solutions
to more complex problems.
