00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.969
Congratulations on completing the first lesson, where you learned what big data

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.800
is, and how Hadoop solves big data problems. In the next lesson,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.560
you'll go deeper in the two main components of Hadoop: HDFS, the

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.690
Hadoop distributed file system, and map

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.760
reduce, which is how Hadoop processes data.
