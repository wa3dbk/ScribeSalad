00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.770
All right. So I created a new class called RecordedAudio with two fields,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.070
filePathUrl and title.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.160
The next thing I will do is go back to RecordSoundsViewController and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.530
then scroll to this audioRecorderDidFinishRecording function.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.700
The first thing I have to do here is I have to save the recorded audio, and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.870
I will do that with the most recent class I have created.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.460
So what I will do is scroll up to the very top and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.860
then create a new object for this class which is RecordedAudio.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.759
There. And then I'll scroll back to my function, and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.090
in here I will initialize the new object.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.890
There.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.280
Now I can set the attributes of this object.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.290
One of them is filePathURL.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.250
The value for this can be obtained using the recorder parameter.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.060
This is the reference to the audio file that was actually recorded on the phone.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.909
So I can say something like recorder.url.

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.362
Then I will set the title of this object recordedAudio.

00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:01.680
I can get this value from the recorder parameter also.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.720
I can say recorder.url.lastPathComponent, this gives

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.950
us the name of the recorded file.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.500
All right, with that, step one is done.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.510
Step two is to perform a segue to the next scene.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.020
I can accomplish that by calling the performSegueWithIdentifier function.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.000
You should not that we inherit this method from UIViewController.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.640
Now, Xcode is asking me for an identifier of the segue, and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.280
I recall that the idea of my segue was stopRecording there.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.040
Just as a quick recap, however, let me go back to my storyboard and then select

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.060
this segue and slide the utility tray out to see that the identifier for

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.980
this segue was in fact stopRecording.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.750
Okay, let me go back to my code.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.320
Now, for this second parameter,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.400
sender, we will pass in the new object, recordedAudio.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.274
Let me do that.

00:01:57.004 --> 00:02:00.560
This is the object that actually initiates the segue.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.040
All right, so it seems like step two is also done.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.200
By the way, at this point I want to highlight that the name of our function is

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.430
called audioRecorderDidFinishRecording successfully.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.440
And the way we can figure out if the recording was in fact

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.660
accomplished successfully is by using this boolean flag.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.702
So I will add an if statement here.

00:02:20.702 --> 00:02:23.501
And enclose all of this code within that if statement.

00:02:26.072 --> 00:02:29.854
If for some reason the audio recording does not finish successfully,

00:02:29.854 --> 00:02:32.481
then what I can do is print out an error message and

00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:35.310
update the correct settings on my buttons.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.860
All right.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.715
Let's run our project.

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:39.660
Okay, let me record something.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.125
Is this going to work?

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.070
Okay, so

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.300
it seems that the segue is happening, and this time it's happening through code.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.180
And now let me play the sound.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.450
&gt;&gt; My mom always said life was like a box of chocolates.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.950
&gt;&gt; Hm, the app is still playing the movie quote.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.820
Why do you think our app is still playing the quote and not the recorded voice?

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.040
Enter your thoughts in this box.
