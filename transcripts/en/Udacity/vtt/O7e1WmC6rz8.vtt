00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.120
We've now reached
the end of this course.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.660
We began with the nature and
problems of our healthcare system and

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.890
the key role that chronic disease plays.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.548
We made the case for
digital records and data sharing.

00:00:13.548 --> 00:00:16.270
And we learned what the Federal
Government is doing to encourage their

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.790
adoption.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.410
We examined the key
underlying technologies and

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.990
looked at how they're being used in
actual systems and tools for providers,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.240
patients, population and
public health, and clinical research.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.990
We explored in more detail how data
can be aggregated for analysis.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.770
And we concluded with a number of
exciting examples of the results that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.469
can be achieved.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.580
We're only at the beginning
of a long journey.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.710
It's my hope that this course will
encourage you to come along and

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.426
be part of a generation that actually
achieves the long held dream of

00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:56.260
transforming healthcare
through health informatics.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.795
Please don't hesitate to
ask me if I can help.

00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:00.890
Good-bye, I wish you well.
