00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.076
So far we've decided the response
we should send back based on

00:00:03.076 --> 00:00:03.873
the request URL.

00:00:03.873 --> 00:00:07.500
But in the real world,
we need to be more dynamic than that.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.970
For example, the page can send
a request which we intercept and

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.730
then send to the network.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.470
But rather than just sending the
response back, we could look at it and

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.940
do something else.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.620
For example,
let's respond with a network fetch for

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.790
the request, just as the browser would
do if we left it to its own devices.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.630
The fetch method will take a full
request object as well as a URL.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.250
As we saw earlier,
fetch returns a promise.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.760
With promises, you can attach
a .then call back to get the result,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.720
if the operation was successful.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.770
Whatever we return in this callback
becomes the eventual value for

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.880
the promise.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.250
This means we can look at
the response ourselves, and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.190
if the responses are 404 Not Found,
we could respond with our own message.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.355
Otherwise, we return
the response we received.

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:59.880
.catch is similar to .then, but .then is
for success and .catch is for failure.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.600
Fetch will fail if it can't make
a connection to the server at all,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.379
which includes offline.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.300
So when that happens,
we can respond with our own message.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.390
So now, if we make sure our
force update is enabled and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.600
hit refresh,
everything is back to normal.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.660
But if we go to a page that doesn't
exist, we get our custom message.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.940
If we take the server down,
go offline, and

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.090
refresh the page,
we get our custom message for that too.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.410
We can create complex rules for
requests,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.410
trying to get a response from multiple
sources, and reacting to the results.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.540
And we can do that on a request by
request basis using JavaScript.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.090
You can even go to the network, and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.920
if that fails,
get something else from the network.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.490
In fact, this sounds like something for
you to do.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.430
Mike, come in, Mike.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.850
Can you hear us?

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.741
&gt;&gt; Yes I can.

00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:50.090
&gt;&gt; How about a task chaining
two fetch requests together?

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do it.
