Earlier, I mentioned it's
important to make sure that

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.090
the content fits within the viewport
to prevent horizontal scrolling.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.050
You should use relative units
when specifying widths for

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.440
elements to prevent them from
accidentally overflowing the viewport.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.050
Keep in mind, CSS does allow
content to overflow it's container.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.810
So if you don't specify a size and,
say, for

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.430
example the image is bigger than
the container, it will overflow.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.240
You can save yourself some headache, and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.350
prevent this from happening by
setting a max width of 100%.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.642
In fact, I recommend adding a catch
all in your main CSS for image,

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:46.060
embed, object and video elements,
that sets this, just to be safe.
