00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.469
There's pretty much a limited number of
factors on reasons why people are going

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.792
to upgrade to pay you for the service.

00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:09.810
For us,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.850
we had multiple tiers or pressure
points that we had set up in the plan.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.070
It's going to be, for the early plans,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.100
how many forms are you going to need,
if you wanted user management.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.210
For example, if you were wanting to
have multiple people on your team have

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.860
access to the resources at hand,
you could easily charge by that.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.880
How many entries or
data that you're going to process,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.830
which made sort of sense and
then certain features that you wanted.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.440
For example,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.230
payment integration was one that would
only be available on the higher planes.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.930
The idea was, the reason that you
stratify on all these different areas

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.670
is because different users
will pay different things.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.580
In a product that was generalized as
Wufoo, there's lots of industries,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.690
markets and verticals, different
people had different pressure points.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.080
Our goal around the features was making
sure people got to try before they buy.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.650
Seeing entries, being able to
build the form, that was fine but

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.570
like payment integration was only
available on a middle tier plan but

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.260
we wanted even free users
to be able to try it out.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.140
We would figure out ways to say,
for five transactions,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.080
you can try it out for yourself to
see what it's going to be like.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.980
Having your own custom theme or
logo, people care very much about I

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.350
want this to be a part of my identity,
and it was a big difference for Wufoo.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.820
What we tried to do was,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.450
in all the different ways that people
might be pressured to upgrade,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.660
we tried to build that inside of Wufoo,
and made it really obvious.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.630
Then it made sense that most
people would send around

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.410
the first plan that had one
set of unlimited features,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.850
which would be unlimited
forms on the middle plan.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.580
The reason you also have
multiple pricing plans

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.950
is because you don't know what the
average revenue per user is going to be.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.110
If you could predict ahead of time
that the average revenue per user is

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.980
going to be, let's say, $25, then you
could just have one pricing plan.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.550
It's free and then it's going to be this
because that's about what it's going to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.390
be and
that makes things a lot simpler but

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.400
you don't know what that's
ultimately going to be.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.440
So you have this grid, it's why people
set it up, to capture that cost but

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.039
some people, again, if you're
going consumer versus going B2B,

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.400
people have different
price sensitivities.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.218
For us, we thought it was like this
is going to be both consumer and

00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:13.980
B2B, and that was the case for us but

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.980
it heavily skewed that most of
our paying customers are all B2B.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.080
We had lots of people individually
using the free plans but

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.560
what would end up happening
is those people and

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.700
their free plans were our biggest
word of mouth growth people.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.070
We made sure that Wufoo with the users
on the free plan, we made it easy for

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.825
them to talk about our services,
share with other people and do all this,

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:34.818
because that's who is going to be our
champions on the individual side.

00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:39.060
On the B2B side, it's usually like
they're spending someone else's money,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.280
someone else's budget, so
they're less price sensitive.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.406
All they care about is does
this help me get things done?

00:02:43.406 --> 00:02:46.940
A lot of the emphasis there is look,
with one click this is just going to

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.540
work, with one click you
are going to install this template,

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.480
with two seconds you are going to
have this feature ready for you and

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.260
you are don't have to
worry about this anymore.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.570
It's all about that convenience and

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.850
saving of time, and it's no going to
cost you nothing, especially for

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.990
people wanting payment integration,
this is going to pay for itself really,

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.670
really quickly and
then showing that evidence of that.
