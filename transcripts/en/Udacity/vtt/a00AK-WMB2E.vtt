00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.990
So, we know how to create and
read from our database entries, but

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.610
how do we update existing
data within our database?

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.460
It seems we have a situation on
our hands that calls for this.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.680
Veggie burgers across town
have been all the rage,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.530
causing rapid price competition
amongst our restaurants.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.030
Urban Burger wants to cut the price
of their veggie burger to $2.99.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.975
With SQLAlchemy, performing an update
like this is a pretty simple,

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:22.370
four-step process.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.530
First, we execute a query to find
the veggie burger we want and

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.020
store it in a variable.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.660
Second, we declare the new
price of the variable.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.950
Next, we add the variable
to our session.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.006
And, finally,
we commit the session to the database.

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:37.165
Follow along as I do this
from the Python shell.

00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:40.335
So, the first step in our update
process is to find the exact item we

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:41.315
want to update.

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:45.265
Looking at the SQLAlchemy documentation
for queries, I see we have a filter_by

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:49.180
feature that let's us filter queries
based on attribute entries, like name.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.690
Let's go to our Python shell and
give it a try.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.750
So, let's use the filter_by function
to find all the veggie burgers in

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.410
our restaurant menu database.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.140
Following the syntax
from the documentation,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.640
I append .filter_by to my
query on MenuItems and

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.080
set the Veggie Burger as the name of
the menu item I want to search for.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.810
Then, I store it in the variable
named veggieBurgers.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.090
The filter_by function always
returns a collection of objects.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.100
So, let's create a for
loop to iterate over each object and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.200
retrieve the information about
each of these veggie burgers.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.650
Inside our for loop, let's print
out the ID of each veggie burger,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.930
its current price, and
the restaurant it belongs to.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.730
I'm also going to print a new line
character to make our results a little

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.880
bit easier to read.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.790
When I close my for

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.890
loop in execute, I get back a list of
all the veggie burgers in my database.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.420
The first one here is from
Urban Burger and has an ID of eight.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.700
Now, I will create another query where
I only return the menu item with

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.960
an ID of eight.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.095
I will store it as UrbanVeggieBurger.

00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:46.620
If I append the .one function
to the end of my query,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.070
I make sure SQLalchemy only
gives me the one object I want,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.410
instead of a list that I
would have it iterate over.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.940
Just to double check we have
the right burger, let me go ahead and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.020
check its price.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.620
Yep, the veggie burger costs $5.99,
just like it did in our first query.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.390
Now, let's reset the price of
the Urban Veggie Burger to $2.99.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.710
We can then add the UrbanVeggieBurger
object to our session and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.130
commit it to the database.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.160
So now, if we execute the same original
query to see all the veggie burgers in

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.960
our database, we see that Urban Burger's
veggie burger now has a price of $2.99.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.860
Now, let's assume all the other
restaurants have reacted to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.330
Urban Burger's audacious price drop and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.020
want to set their burger
prices to $2.99 as well.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.440
Let's use our same for loop and
modify it a bit to change the price of

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.630
all the veggie burgers in
our database to $2.99.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.460
I'm going to use this if statement to
avoid unnecessary database updates to

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.380
an entry that already
has a price of $2.99,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.510
and just update the other
veggie burger menu items.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.270
Now, querying a third time,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.300
I see all the veggie burgers in
our menu have the same price.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.240
Let's get a little more practice with
updates by answering the following

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.825
quiz questions.
