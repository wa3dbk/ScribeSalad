00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.280
The boat travels at 25 miles per hour, great algebra solving if you found that

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.820
answer. We know the lowest common denominator for this equation would be x

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.489
minus 5 times x plus 5. So, we multiply our equation through by the LCD. These

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:21.160
binomials cancel with one another, leaving us with this equation. Here on the

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.292
right hand side I recognize that this was the difference of squares pattern. So

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:32.438
I just have x squared minus 25 a squared minus b squared. Next we distribute to

00:00:32.438 --> 00:00:37.599
get this equation. Now we just want to combine my terms. 10 x plus 15 x equals

00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:45.408
25 x. And positive 50 minus 75 equals negative 25. Next we add 25 to both sides

00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:48.771
or just remove the negative 25 since it's balanced on each side of the

00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:55.392
equation. This leaves us with 25 x Eequal to x squared. We have a quadratic

00:00:55.392 --> 00:00:58.926
equation, so we want to move this term to the other side, with the positive x

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:05.731
squared term. This allows us to set our equation, equal to 0. Now we're in a

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:10.420
position to factor this quadratic. I've rewritten it here, and then I factored

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.578
an x out of each of these terms. So I'll have x times x minus 25. Now we set

00:01:16.578 --> 00:01:23.505
each factor equal to 0, leaving us with x equals 0, or x equals 25. So there

00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:28.745
are actually two possible values for x, 25 or 0. But since the boat is actually

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:34.156
moving, we know it can't be zero. Therefore, the boat must move at 25 miles per

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:36.150
hour in still water.
