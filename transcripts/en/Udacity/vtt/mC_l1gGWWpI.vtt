00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.440
I still like to write out what y and z are equal to? If we initially had y cubed

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.780
plus z cubed, then y is equal to m here and z is equal to the cubed root of 27,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.097
which is just 3. Three cubed gives us 27, great, that checks off. Now our

00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:22.793
binomial is just going to be y plus z or m plus 3, and our trinomial is going to

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:26.429
be m squared minus 3m plus 9, beautiful.
