00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.750
x plus 4 divided by x plus 1 is correct. For the first numerator, we find the

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.450
factors of 12 that sum to positive 7, which are positive 3 and positive 4. For

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.013
the second numerator, we find the factors of positive 4 that add to negative 5.

00:00:15.013 --> 00:00:19.922
These are negative 4 and negative 1. Notice that the a coefficient in front of

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:24.354
the x squared term is 1 in every single quadratic. This means that we can just

00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:28.660
use the factors we find of 12 That summed to 7 in our binomials. The same was

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.188
true here, we used the factors of positive four that sum to negative five and

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:36.133
four in our binomials. These are the factors for our other denominators and now

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:41.300
we're ready to simplify. X plus 3 divided by x plus 3 equals 1. And x minus 4

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.706
divided by x minus 4 Also equals 1. The last equivalence of 1 is x minus 1 and x

00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:52.324
minus 1. Remember that these factors don't dis, disappear, they really equal 1.

00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:58.294
So we multiply 1 times x plus 4 and one's times x plus 1. Any times anything is

00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:03.174
itself. So we're left with x plus 4 divided by the quantity x plus 1.
