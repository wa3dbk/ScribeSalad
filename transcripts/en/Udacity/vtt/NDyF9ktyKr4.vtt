So far in this course, we've seen the operations of addition, subtraction,

00:00:04.268 --> 00:00:08.525
multiplication, and division. We've also looked at some other symbols like

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:13.197
parentheses and brackets. There's actually another type of symbol we're going to

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.339
learn. It looks like this. Now, I'm not, not going to tell you what this means.

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.891
We're actually going to try and figure that out together. So, let's try and

00:00:21.903 --> 00:00:28.033
figure this out through a story. I asked four people at Udacity how many candies

00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:33.591
were in a jar. The person with the closest guess got to keep the whole jar.

00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:39.460
Here's what they said. Katie said, 743. Kogure said, 728. Andy said, 714, and

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:45.873
Kathleen said, 746. There are 734 candies in the jar. Knowing this information,

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:47.194
who won the jar?
