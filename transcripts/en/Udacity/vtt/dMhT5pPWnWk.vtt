00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.930
For incoming traffic,

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.430
the SPI in IPsec header is used
to look up the SA in SADB.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.010
And the packet is
unprocessed accordingly.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.150
Then the SPD is looked at to
make sure that the packet

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.670
had the proper security measures
according to the policy.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.000
And only then,
the packet is delivered to that player.
