00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.150
Now there's a wealth of resources online and

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.080
classes you could take to learn more about these things,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.110
many of which you can find in the resources section of this course.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.450
But my best advice to learning more when I encourage all of you to do this,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.530
is to simply start creating your own visualizations, your own graphics and

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.960
your own projects, and put them online for others to see,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.120
either in the form of this course, or on a personal blog or public site.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.290
And with that, I'll bid you farewell.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.740
I hope to see some of your awesome projects for

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.830
this course and things you create outside this course.
