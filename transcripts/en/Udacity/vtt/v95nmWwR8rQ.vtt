00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.820
In the interview that we did at the beginning of the class,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.430
we talked with John about GitHub, where GitHub is a Git hosting website, and

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.390
John told you all about it. For this class, we will be

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.350
using GitHub as our Git hosting. Let's see how GitHub works in practice and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.450
let's see some of the common features offered by GitHub.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.010
This is what we'll do in the third part of this Git demo. What I'm showing here

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.550
is the GitHub website and as I said, GitHub is a Git hosting website and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.950
you can create an account on GitHub by simply signing up on the website. And

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.100
because we already have an account that we're simply going to sign in

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.570
to see what kind of functionality GitHub offers. And we're going to specify our

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.190
username and password. And as you can see on the GitHub website,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.695
you can use this menu up on the right to create a new repository or

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:51.500
change the account settings. Let's click on our user profile. And

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.270
here we can see some statistics for our user. For

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.190
example, we can see statistic about our contributions and our repositories. So

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.560
now if we go to the Repositories view, we can create a new repository.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.117
We give it a name. Let's call it myrepo. We can provide the description for

00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:11.680
the repository. If we want, we can initialize the repository by adding a README

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.860
file. And even though we are not doing it right now, if you can see up here,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.820
you can also add a license here on the right and it allows you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.831
to choose from a set of predefined licenses. And you can also a .gitignore file,

00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:28.410
which, in case you don't know what that is, it's a very convenient file that

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.740
will automatically exclude from the repositories file that should not be added.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.690
So if you remember in the lesson we said there are things that you should not

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.263
add to the repositories. For example, derived files. So

00:01:39.263 --> 00:01:42.360
here, using this menu, you can pick the type of project that you have.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.740
For example, Java project or PHP project or many other kinds of projects. And

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.510
the GitHub will automatically add that file for you.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.680
But let's skip that for now and simply create our repository. And

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.000
that creates a repository that contains the README file because that's what we

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.580
decided to do. And it also allows you to edit the README file by clicking on it.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.560
It will bring up an editor and here you can write, you know,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.949
for example, initial readme for your project. Then you can add your

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.070
commit message up there and then you can commit the changes to your README file.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.212
The site also provides many other features, like, for example, creating issues,

00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:22.030
pull requests, adding and editing a wiki, and also, you know,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.740
defining other characteristics and settings for the repository. Now, if we go to

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.500
the repository, you can see that we also get the HTTPS link for the repository.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.870
So this is the URL that you can use to clone your repository. If you remember,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.250
with a git clone command, that's the URL that you can specify. So

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.480
let's try to do that and clone that repository. So we're going to copy this URL.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.300
To do that, we're going to execute git clone and specify the URL that we

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.310
just copied. And you can see that the project was created, was cloned locally.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.760
And if we go under myrepo, which is the name of the repository, you can see that

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.570
the README file that we created on GitHub is here. So if we create a new file,

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.340
which we're going to call again, newFile just to be clear. And then we

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.920
can add it, commit it, specifying as usual a commit message. So at this point,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.940
we can push our locked out changes to the remote GitHub repository. And

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.340
because the GitHub repository is password protected,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.660
we have to specify our login and password. And of course, if you

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.770
pass the wrong password, GitHub is not going to let you in. So let's try again.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.110
Let's try to get the password right this time. I'm going to specify again,

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.130
my login and my password. At this point, the push is successful and

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.220
my changes are actually pushed to the master, which is the GitHub repository.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.020
To double check that, let's go back to the GitHub repository and as you can see,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.470
that the file that we added, newFile, is there as expected. And of course,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.880
there's many more things that you can do on the GitHub website, so

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.410
I strongly encourage you to go and try out things. But

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.980
the key message here is that the GitHub is a Git hosting website where you

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.990
can get an account and create your remote repositories.
