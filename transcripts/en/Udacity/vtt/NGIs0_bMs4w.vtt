If you said 2/20, great work. We know 2 times 1
is 2 and 5 times 4 is 20. You might have also

00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:09.551
put a different answer. You might have
reduced. You might have divided your

00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:14.641
fraction by 2/2, and you would have gotten
1/10. Both 1/10 and 2/20 are correct.

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:19.253
Let's look at why. So here, I have two
candy bars. This top one's been put up on

00:00:19.265 --> 00:00:24.318
20th. This bottom one has been split up
into 10th. I know that my answer was

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.067
supposed to be 2/20. Two out of 20 pieces.
Visually, I can see that's 1/10. I have

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.574
one out of the ten pieces down here. 2/20
and 1/10 are actually equal fractions.

00:00:33.574 --> 00:00:37.586
They represent the same amount.
Oftentimes, you say that 1/10 is the

00:00:37.598 --> 00:00:41.698
reduced form or the simplified form of
2/20. But as we can tell, both are

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.763
actually equal. They just look different.
