00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.930
But the other way of doing 3D sensing is
what we refer to as active 3D sensing,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.230
where somehow, you're projecting
something out into the environment,

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.590
or sending some energy
into the environment and

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.210
reading that energy back,
in order to recover depth.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.450
So we actually talked just a little
bit about photometric stereo,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.000
when we talked about photometry, and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.820
the idea that you could recover shape
if you had known light sources.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.840
So, even though these are thought
of as regular images, you're,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.750
it's actually an active
sensing technique,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.479
because you're lighting the system in
a controlled way that you know about.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.120
But, when most people talk
about active sensing,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.800
they talk about something that creates,
sort of, special signals or pictures.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.801
So an obvious one is,
just bounce something off a surface,

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:48.167
and wait to see how long it
takes to get back, all right?

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:50.540
So there are different
methods of doing that.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.560
This is a little guy.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.500
He has these little ultrasonic sensors,
okay?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.460
If you go way back in time, back in the,
way back machine, I don't know if

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.920
it was the 70s or 80s, the Polaroid
cameras started doing active sensing.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.260
They actually had a little
acoustic sonar chip on them,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.830
that would send out
what's called a chirp.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.030
And then,
based upon how long the response got,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.900
how long the response took,
it knew based upon the speed of sound,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.960
how far away the thing was,
and it would focus the camera.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.020
One of the interesting effects of that
is, because they made so many of those

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.750
cameras, it made those sonar things very
cheap, so people started putting them

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.930
all over robots and things like that,
and using sonar to detect depth.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.870
Much more sophisticated is what's
called LIDAR, or a Laser Range finder.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.740
There's two of them here.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.120
One is on the side over here,
one is stuck in here.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.280
These are on a PR2 robot.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.620
These actually generate a slice and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.180
they, they send a little beam out and
they wait to see how long it comes back.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.890
Now of course, that's a lot
faster than with sound, okay, but

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.260
it, it's measurable, but
you only get a slice of depth.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.190
So then what you actually do, is you put
it on a little device that goes up and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.120
down like that, and so this little front
area actually sweeps that plane and

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.210
it produces a 3D depth image that way.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.390
So that's these are referred
to as time of flight sensors.
