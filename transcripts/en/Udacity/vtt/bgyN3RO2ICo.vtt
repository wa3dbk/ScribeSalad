00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.830
So I'm going to talk about confusion matrices.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.311
It's a word you've probably never heard before, but it's good vocabulary if you

00:00:06.311 --> 00:00:09.160
want to do machine learning and talk to somebody else about it.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.120
Imagine we have a classifier above this line,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.680
the class tables are red Xs, and below the line we have green circles.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.393
As before, we call the red X as positive examples and

00:00:19.393 --> 00:00:21.250
the green circle's negative.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.030
The confusion matrix is a two by two matrix.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.918
It compares the actual class, which can be positive or negative.

00:00:27.918 --> 00:00:30.540
With it, we called a predicted class,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.520
it's our output which also can be positive or negative.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.400
And each on the right increments the count on the left.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.160
So let's see.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.670
Let's take a data point over here that is negative, and

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.190
that is classified to lie on the green side of the classifier.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.410
If I wanted to count this type of data,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.000
in which of the four buckets on the left would it fall?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.605
Just click on the corresponding pocket.
