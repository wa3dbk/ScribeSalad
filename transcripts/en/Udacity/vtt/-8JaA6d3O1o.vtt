00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.230
So how might you use the idea of configuration to design an agent that can

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.280
answer Raven's progressive matrices? We've talked in the past about how

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.880
constraint propagation can help us solving these problems. If configuration is

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.360
a type of constraint propagation, how can you leverage the idea of variables and

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.000
values in designing your agent? What are the variables and

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.670
what values can they take? We've also discussed how planning can be applied to

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.610
Raven's progressive matrices. If configuration leverages old plans,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.310
how you build your agent to remember those old plans and reconfigure them for

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.940
new problems? Will it develop the old plans based on existing problems, or

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.220
will you hand it the problems in advance?
