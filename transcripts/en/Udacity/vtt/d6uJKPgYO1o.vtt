00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.620
Now that we've got this pure prototypal version of the car class, let's

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.060
refactor it into the very closely related pattern known as pseudo-classical.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.200
The pattern we're about to build is called pseudo-classical because it

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.100
attempts to resemble the class systems from other languages by adding

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.540
a thin layer of syntactic conveniences.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.410
If we plan on making a lot of classes in our programs, and we do,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.710
there's a lot of code here that would get repetitive to repeat every time.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.550
Perhaps the language could do more of these steps automatically somehow.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.549
Which lines here seem likely to show up in every class you write and maybe seem

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.320
like the language could provide some mechanism for doing automatically for you?
