Let's talk about factors that affect simple linear regression. you already saw

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.880
before that outliers affect the value of r, the correlation coefficient. Well,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.430
outliers also affect the linear regression line. This could be our regression

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.205
line with this sample data. But an outlier, let's say it's out here, can

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:24.420
seriously pull this regression line down. Outliers are always important to take

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.100
note of when doing any kind of statistical analysis.
