00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.073
Let us look at the solution to our full predication quiz. We have this branch

00:00:05.073 --> 00:00:10.290
based if, then, else code. We're trying to if convert it using full predication.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:19.770
P1 here is set when R2 is zero. When R2 is zero, we branch to the else part.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.300
So this is what gets done if R2 is zero. That means that.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.870
We do this when P1 is true. And then of course we do this when it's not true.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.000
The next part that we want to do is when should we do the if conversions. So

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.580
what needs to be the accuracy here. Let's foresee how many instructions we

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.970
have in each of these. Here we have three instructions with a CPI of 0.5.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.820
This always takes us 1.5 cycles, assuming that there are other things that

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.590
can be done in the rest of the cycle. Here, when this branch is taken,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.030
we do two instructions. When this branch is not taken, we do three instructions.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.300
So let's split the difference and say that on average we do 2.5 instructions.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:15.290
At the CPI of 0.5. That means that without a misprediction, we get 1.25 cycles.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.270
A misprediction adds ten cycles. These two perform equally

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.310
when the cost of mispredictions here. Is 0.25 cycles per branch.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.110
So pretty much, the difference between between these two is 0.25 cycles. So

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.250
on average, we can lose this much to get this to be equal. The penalty for

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.470
a single misprediction is 10 cycles. If we can lose only 0.25 cycles per branch.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.455
That means that only one in 40 branches can be mis-predicted. one in 40 is 2.5%.

00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:58.120
That means that our correct prediction needs to

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.350
be at least 97.5% to not do this conversion. If the correct

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.030
prediction rate is less that this then we a better off with if conversion.
