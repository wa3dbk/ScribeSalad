00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.100
It is fairly common practice
to take this set of data and

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.880
fit a line to it using
linear regression.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.880
Let's say we got a line
something like that.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.340
And to look at the statistics
of that linear fit.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.820
One property is the slope.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.380
When we fit a line,
what's the slope of that line?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.350
Let's assume it turns out to be 1 for

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.760
this particular stock and
its relationship to the S&amp;P 500.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.349
This slope, in financial terminology,

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:37.220
is usually referred to as beta with
this symbol, or just the word beta.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.830
And what beta means is how reactive
is the stock to the market.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.140
So if beta is 1, and
we have a slope here of 1, it means,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.340
on average, when the market goes up 1%,
that particular stock also goes up 1%.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.255
If we have, say, a higher number, say,

00:00:58.255 --> 00:01:02.450
2, that would mean that if
the market were to go up 1%,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.310
we'd expect on average for
that stock to go up 2%.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.000
There's another factor you can see here

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.340
when you look at where that line
intercepts the vertical axis.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.910
That is called alpha.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.428
And you've probably heard about
alpha in investing circles, and

00:01:22.428 --> 00:01:28.734
what that means is that this stock is
actually on average performing a little

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:35.610
bit better than the S&amp;P 500 every day
if that number, alpha, is positive.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.290
If it's negative,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.590
it means on average it's returning a
little bit less than the market overall.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.290
That's how you can plot the data,
fit a line to it, and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.325
measure a couple aspects of this
performance with regard to the market or

00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:52.750
with regard to some other stock.
