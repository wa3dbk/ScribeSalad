Here's a different city map. And in this city, the naming starts here. We have

00:00:04.928 --> 00:00:09.999
1st Street, 2nd street, and then it continues. The avenues are the same, but the

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:15.018
avenues run north south. 1st Avenue, 2nd Avenue, and so on. Maybe this is the

00:00:15.018 --> 00:00:19.967
intersection of the 0th Street, and 0th Avenue. Now, 0th Street and 0th Avenue

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:24.239
are pretty silly names for streets, but that's okay. And maybe this intersection

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.288
is important. It's where the first building may have been built, so residents

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:32.143
called it the origin. I'll just label it 0. Now, I want to think about this

00:00:32.143 --> 00:00:36.203
intersection at 5th Street and 3rd Avenue in relationship to the origin. How

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:40.479
would you complete the following statement? How many blocks is this intersection

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:45.628
to the right of the origin? And above the origin. Fill in the numbers here.
