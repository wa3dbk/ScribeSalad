00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.930
There are two models that examine the role of stress in relation to our health.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.010
One is the Physiological Reactivity Model, which attempts to explain the causal

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.736
role of stress-related bodily changes in illness. The second model is called

00:00:14.736 --> 00:00:18.660
the Health Behavior Approach. Here the explanation for illness or health is

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.880
focused on the role of behaviors such as diet, exercise, and substance abuse.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.699
We already discussed how diet, exercise, and substance abuse are ways of coping

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.759
with stress, so we won't say much more about the health behavior approach.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.819
However, let's talk about the physiological reactivity model. So let's take

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:40.275
this example, let's say you walk in the class and the professor says, put your

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:44.993
books away, take out a piece of paper, we're having a test. Hearing this

00:00:44.993 --> 00:00:49.230
statement from your professor may cause stress. The fact that you're not

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.367
prepared for the pop quiz results in a stressful response. However, if you have

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:58.271
read the material and studied, hearing the professor say put your notes away

00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:03.980
and get out a sheet of paper may not result in a stressful response. So here we

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.540
have an event, which is the pop quiz, and then your appraisal of the situation.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.344
And this, is what's really important here. You may appraise a situation in a

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:18.896
positive and beneficial way which produces positive emotions. However on the

00:01:18.896 --> 00:01:22.202
other hand you may see the situation as negative or even potentially

00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:27.063
threatening and that produces negative emotions. From here the negative

00:01:27.063 --> 00:01:32.116
emotions causes the stress response. Which you can recall is the activation of

00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:37.161
the sympathetic nervous system. However, prolonged exposure to the stressful

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:41.449
situation causes extended release of cortisol and sustained activation of the

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:47.699
sympathetic nervous system which in turn weakens the body. As we discussed

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:51.920
earlier the body is negatively effected by the suppression of the immune system

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.150
which increases our succeptability to illness. Now one factor we did not

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.054
discuss was that prolong exposure to activation of the sympathetic nervous

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:06.246
system also has negative consequences on our cardiovascular health.
