00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.145
First, we have to keep a couple things in mind. I have to decide what variable

00:00:04.157 --> 00:00:07.845
I'm going to use for the angle. I'm going to let a equal the measure of the

00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:11.940
angle. Next, I have to remember what supplement and complement mean. If you

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:16.204
recall, the supplement of an angle, I'll write it as s, is equal to 180 minus

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:20.499
the measure of the angle. So here, we have the supplement as 180 minus the

00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:25.280
measure of the angle. The other thing we have to remember is the complement. The

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:29.863
complement of an angle is 90 degrees minus the measure of the angle. So, I have

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:34.512
the measure of the angle is a. The supplement is 180 minus a, and the complement

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:39.107
is 90 minus a. Now, we can try to turn the words into an equation. The

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:44.465
supplement of the angle s measures, which means equals, 30 degrees more. So

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:50.169
that's 30 plus twice it's compliment. I know that s equals 180 minus a, and I

00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:55.641
know that the compliment is 90 minus a. Now I can solve the equation for a. The

00:00:55.653 --> 00:01:00.555
first thing we need to do to solve this equation is to distribute this 2. So I

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:05.087
have 180 minus a equals 30 plus 2 times 90 is 180. And 2 times negative a is

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:10.073
negative 2 a. The next thing I want to do combine these like terms. 180 plus 30

00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:14.940
is 210. I need to get all my variables onto one side of the equation, and I'm

00:01:14.952 --> 00:01:20.036
going to do that by adding 2 a to both sides of the equation. When I add 2 a to

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:25.425
both sides of the equation, the left side I have 180. Negative a plus 2 a gives

00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:30.839
me a. And that's going to equal 210. The next thing I need to do is subtract 180

00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:36.019
from both sides. And I get a equals 210 minus 180 which gives me 30. So, the

00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:41.003
measure of an angle who's supplement measures 30 degrees more than twice it's

00:01:41.015 --> 00:01:45.222
complement is 30 degrees. I think we've had enough of word problems for now.

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:47.071
Let's move on to something else.
