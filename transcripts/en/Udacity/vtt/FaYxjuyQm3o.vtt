00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.223
I know if I pay the full price of the shoes, I have to pay a 100%. But I get 20%

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:10.826
off of that price sp I should only pay 80%. I'm going to show you how to finish

00:00:10.838 --> 00:00:15.706
this problem out. So, I have 80% of the original cost. I know of means

00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:21.223
multiplication. So, I have 80% times the original cost which is $60. I'm going

00:00:21.223 --> 00:00:26.760
to change my percent to a decimal. I know I need to divide by 100, because it's

00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:32.299
percent. So I move the decimal two places to the left, I get 0.8 times $60. I'm

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:34.905
going to do 8/10 times $60, I get 48.

00:00:34.907 --> 00:00:40.205
So, I only need to pay $48 to get the shoes. That's a pretty good deal. Okay.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:42.055
Let's try another problem.
