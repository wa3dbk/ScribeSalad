00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.062
The first thing I'll do is I'll ask the user for a value. Could be a floating

00:00:03.062 --> 00:00:06.936
point value because the water could have gone down by a fractional amount. I'll

00:00:06.936 --> 00:00:10.470
read the next double and if the value is negative, I'll increment the counter.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.124
Now, if I want the user to keep on entering more values, I'll need to tell them

00:00:14.124 --> 00:00:18.966
that. And it looks like I forgot colon space on the first one. That wouldn't

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.716
have looked very pretty. Fix that in my compile errors, and it looks like I'm

00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:26.750
ready to go. If I run the program, I can enter values, and I've entered two

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.450
negative values now, so if I finish, I expect to see the count as two. And if

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.622
looks like the water line fell on two years. I'd probably want to fix out the

00:00:36.622 --> 00:00:40.133
spacing before I shared this. But right now I'm counting all of the negative

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.539
numbers just the way I wanted to.
