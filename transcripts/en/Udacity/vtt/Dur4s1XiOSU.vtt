00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.270
Now that you know a little about how
your app will be visually organized, and

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.850
some of the common design
patterns you might use,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.900
let's talk about how you can
customize its look and feel.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.200
Android uses themes and
styles to create reusable sets of

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.410
attributes that can be applied
to your UI to customize it.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.630
It's similar to CSS on the web.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.240
A style the appearance
of a single UI element.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.750
You might change the style of
an element for branding reasons,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.070
such as the color or the font.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.008
Or for
practical reasons such as legibility.

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:33.640
A theme uses the same syntax as a style,
but applied as a collection of

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.730
styles to an element, an activity,
or even your whole application.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.245
Now styles always operate
on a single element.

00:00:40.245 --> 00:00:42.460
Whereas themes cascade to its children.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.080
For example, if you wanted to turn all
of the buttons in your application

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.800
pink to match your branding,
then you can create a style to do that.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.610
And then apply it to
the whole application theme.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.950
Next up James will show you
how to apply this lesson.
