You've been using MathQuill for the past few lessons, and hopefully you've

00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:08.215
gotten used to entering exponents and fractions using it, making your equations

00:00:08.227 --> 00:00:12.393
and expressions look super pretty. But now that we're starting to use radicals,

00:00:12.488 --> 00:00:16.663
we need to use MathQuill in a new way. I already showed you earlier how to enter

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:21.363
square roots in MathQuill, you type backslash sqrt space, and then whatever goes

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:25.691
inside. The MathQuill also let's us write nthroots. So, it allows us to type

00:00:25.703 --> 00:00:30.379
radical signs and then type whatever number we want for the index, and then, of

00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:35.084
course, enter whatever we want underneath the radical. To write a radical sign

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:39.602
when you need to write a number you just write backslash nthroot space, and then

00:00:39.614 --> 00:00:43.605
whatever number you want to go in this spot up here. To get out of typing in the

00:00:43.617 --> 00:00:47.477
index spot, to typing underneath the radical sign again, you need to type a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.517
right arrow key. So, try out these first two where you can use some instructions

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:55.302
on what to type. And then, for your two challenge problems, I'd like you to

00:00:55.314 --> 00:00:59.024
experiment combining the different functionalities in MathQuill that we've been

00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:02.956
using with this new set of tools. So, we have, for example, in this term,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.577
exponents combined with radicals and fractions all in one. So, if you can do

00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:12.558
this, you're an official MathQuill pro. Just experiment, just have fun to see

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.785
how incredibly powerful this tool is.
