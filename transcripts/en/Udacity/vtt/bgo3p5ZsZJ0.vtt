00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
The speedup here is traumatic, just because we write the square root here.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:15.290
It's over a trillion and the reason is that 2⁵⁰ is about 10¹⁵ whereas 2^√⁵⁰, so the ^√⁵⁰ is about 7,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.390
2^√ is about 134.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.320
You have 100 and 34 versus 10¹⁵, which is a speedup of over a trillion,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.560
and we're still within the laws of NP completeness using this function here.

00:00:30.560 --> 99:59:59.000
We can call this loophole 1 in the laws of NP completeness.
