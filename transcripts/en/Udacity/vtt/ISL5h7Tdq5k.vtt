00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The next question I’d like to ask you about a different scatter plot--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
this one relating to web analytics.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We’re comparing two measurements that are fairly commonly used.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
One is Click Through Rate which represents the fraction of people who visit a page

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that go on to do something--typically clicking an ad, clicking through to a course of Udacity,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
clicking through an article of a new site, etc.,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the time it takes to load a web page--the page load time.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now, let’s looks some simulated data.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
When looking at this data, I'd like you to answer a few questions.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
First, do you believe these pieces of data are related?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That is for different page load times, is the Click Through Rate different?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And then similar to what you’ve been asked before, I’d like you to tell me if the relationship

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
between these things is linear--if in fact there is a relationship.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And then I'd like you to also tell me whether the relationship is exact.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And then I’d also like you to tell me two more things.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Is the relationship between these positive or negative?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Just recall what a positive and negative relationship are a couple of simplified examples.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
A perfectly positive linear relationship would look something like this,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but this and this are also positive relationships, whereas a negative linear relationship

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
would look like this, but this and this are also negative relationships.

00:01:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Take a look at this data and check all that apply.
