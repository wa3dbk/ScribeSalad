00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
There are all kinds of other cool stuff you can do with the data.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is a cleaned up data set where I took these extreme values out manually.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And then I kind of want to scatterplot off today's weight versus last year's weight.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And when I do this, I get an interesting graph.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It is approximately linear, but there are some very funny outliers.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There's a point over here. Obviously someone thought I went from 0 to 200 within a year.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And there are also points over here that indicate massive weight loss

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
or massive weight gain within the span of a year.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I have no clue why people believe I massively lost or gained weight.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But as a statistician, looking at the data is really informative.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It tells you that even in the spectrum of good guesses, there are some that are suspicious

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
or people likely didn't take the question very seriously.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
As a statistician, your skill will be to look at these data points more deeply

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and possibly remove them based on what you see in this scatterplot over here.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
That goes way beyond the idea of quartiles but in the estimation of the mean

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
those phenomena have a massive impact as to what your final outcome looks like.

00:01:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Thank you everybody for supplying the data that led to this programming unit.
