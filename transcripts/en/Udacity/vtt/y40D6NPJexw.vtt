00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.780
These four types of competition may
seem like a lot, and they can be.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.880
But you don't need to focus
on all of them at once.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.119
It's just really to help
you organize your thoughts.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.030
Now with our flavored water example,
if you're a brand manager of this water

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.400
bottle, you'll need to analyze
all four levels of competition so

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.430
you know how to position yourselves
in terms of the brand and

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.300
in terms of real placement of
this product on store shelves.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.850
But as a startup with an app,
it's good to know the different types of

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.865
competition you have out there, at
the different levels, but don't bother

00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:33.830
over-analyzing the competition at levels
that make less sense for you right now.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.530
Like the budget level.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.720
So now that we know the different
types of competition,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.680
how do we figure out
where we fit among them?

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.840
Well, let's talk about that now.
