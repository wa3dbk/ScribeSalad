00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.170
Now let's talk about decidability.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.029
I'd like you to tell me which of the following statements are actually decidable

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.370
and check whichever ones are.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.090
The first one is given a program P and an input I,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.970
P produces I as its output.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.510
The second statement is given two programs, they will always produce the same output

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.560
for a given input.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.460
The third is given a program P and input I, P uses at most 50KB of memory.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.610
Next, given a program P that takes 2 arbitrary integers as input,

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.530
we determine if P outputs the sum of these numbers.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.560
Finally, given a graph with N vertices, determine if it has a clique of size at least k.

00:00:44.560 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that you think are decidable.
