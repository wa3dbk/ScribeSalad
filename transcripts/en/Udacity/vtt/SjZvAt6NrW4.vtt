00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So this is a demonstration of a lexical analyzer.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And what I'm going to show you is

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
how to test things out or change things around.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For example, let's go up here and turn "This" into a quoted string.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So previously, our first token was the WORD, ' This ',

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but when I rerun it, I'm really expecting to see the STRING, "This"--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
because I've put This in quotes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And now it is the STRING, ' This '.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
These other numbers,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
after lexical analyzer token STRING, with token value, ' This '

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
are the line and character number information.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The token corresponding to ' This ' starts on line 1, at character zero.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The token corresponding to ' is ' starts on line 1, character 7--

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7--yep, that's where the "i" starts.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So let's say we made a mistake,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we got one of our regular expressions wrong.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Let's say that I mistakenly put in a Greater Than sign here,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
for LANGLESLASH.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Well, then right after "my", I would expect to see the output change.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm going to expect to see us get the wrong answer.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Currently, right after ' my ', we see LANGLESLASH.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Let's rerun it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Oh! Now we don't see quite the right thing at all.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Right after the ' b ', we see an LANGLESLASH,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
but it's associated with the wrong text.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
After ' my ', we just see an LANGLE.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The slash is made its way into this WORD, ' /b '.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
By looking at this output,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
we can notice mistakes in our lexical analyzer and help fix them.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I repair the problem,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
rerun, and the world looks like a bit better.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Here, I've used Python's triple quoting approach.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We have the word Tricky; the quoted STRING, "string";

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
LANGLE, word, RANGLE, output, LANGLE, slash, i, RANGLE, word--

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and then we're done.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Let's go see how this comes out.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We've got the word Tricky; the STRING, "string"--

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and if you've noticed, we've shaved off the 2 double quotes,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
which is just what we wanted,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
an LANGLE, the i, the RANGLE, the word ' output ', LANGLESLASH,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Bang at the end.
