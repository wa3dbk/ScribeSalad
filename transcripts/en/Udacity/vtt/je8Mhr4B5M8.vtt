00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.590
In 1936 when Alan Turing wrote his
famous paper on computable numbers

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.810
he not only created
the Turing machine but

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.580
had a number of other major insights
on the nature of computation.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.820
Turing realized that
the computer program itself

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.540
could also be considered
as part of the input.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.800
There really is no difference
between a program and data.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.380
We all take that as a given today.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.340
We create computer code in a file
that gets stored in the computer and

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.210
no differently than any
other type of file.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.920
And data files often have computer
instructions embedded in them.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.070
Even modern computer fonts are basically
small programs that generate readable

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.529
characters at arbitrary sizes.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.390
Once Turing took the view
of program code as data

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.120
he had the beautiful idea that a Turing
machine could simulate that code.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.830
There is some fixed Turing machine,
a universal Turing machine,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.140
that can simulate the code
of any other Turing machine.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.630
Again this is an idea that we take for
granted today as we have interpreters

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.080
and compilers that can run the code
of any programming language.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.870
But back in Turing's day,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.980
this idea of a universal machine
was a major breakthrough.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.520
It allowed Turing, and will allow us to
develop problems that Turing machines,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.460
or any other computer cannot solve.
