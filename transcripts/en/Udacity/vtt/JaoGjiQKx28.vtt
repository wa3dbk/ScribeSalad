CookiesPerDay is an int. So I'll use percent d and I want the width to be six.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:13.740
Cereal boxes per day is a double so in quotes I'll need percent f. And I wanted

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.494
to be four characters wide with two decimals. Name of the string and I haven't

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:24.132
gotten any special width requirement, so this one is just percent s.
