00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.434
We've seen what a negative exponent does to something in the numerator, it moves

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:08.546
the base to the denominator. So if a negative exponent moves something in the

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:12.633
numerator to the denominator, then a negative exponent in the denominator must

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:16.792
move that to the numerator. When we first saw negative exponents, we learned

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:21.082
that a base raised to a negative exponent, would be the reciprocal of that base

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:25.611
raised to its positive exponent. This can also work in the opposite way, like if

00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:30.353
we have a negative exponent in the denominator. A negative exponent indicates to

00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:34.769
write the reciprocal of the base to the positive power, so I have 1 divided by 1

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.173
4th, the reciprocal of 4, squared, I change the negative to positive. I know

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:43.382
dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by a reciprocal, so I can

00:00:43.382 --> 00:00:47.610
rewrite this expression as 1 times 4 squared. And again, notice a negative

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.702
exponent in the denominator, moves the base to the numerator with its positive

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:55.783
exponent. We can use the same reasoning with variables. I see a negative

00:00:55.783 --> 00:01:00.135
exponent in the denominator, so I know that this base is going to wind up with a

00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:04.535
positive power in the numerator, y to the 5th. For this last one we want to be

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:08.866
careful, 5 has an exponent of 1, and x has an exponent of negative 4, so only

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:13.301
the x term is moved to the numerator. When we handle this negative exponent, we

00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:17.656
rewrite our expression as x to the 4th divided by 5. In general here's the rule

00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:21.890
we can write for base raised to a negative exponent that appears in the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.815
denominator, we simply write it in the numerator, with its positive exponent.
