00:00:03.245 --> 00:00:05.742
Here's another expression for us to play with.

00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:11.853
3 log of x plus 2 log of y minus one half log of z

00:00:11.853 --> 00:00:15.362
Now I'd like you to use all three log properties 
that we've learned

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:19.000
to condense this expression as much as you can.
