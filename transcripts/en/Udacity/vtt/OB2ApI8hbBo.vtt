00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.590
So let's talk about some of the key
features that we have to implement.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.920
Or some of the other functionality that
the Trusted Computing Base must have.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.410
We have to have a complete mediation.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.660
We have to guarantee that
there's no way to get to

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.330
a resource without going through
the trusted computing base, okay, or

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.320
the reference monitor
that it implements.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.990
We have to have a trusted path.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.560
Remember, trusted path is needed
because otherwise what could happen?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.940
Well, some malicious program, a trojan
for example, can spoof the interface of

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.530
your trusted system and ultimate trusted
system is your trusted computing base.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.580
So it could look like
the operating system and

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.370
you may think that the log in is being,
you're interacting with the OS.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.040
A trusted path allows you to guarantee

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.680
that when you think you're talking
to the trusted computing base or

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.850
the operating system,
you indeed are talking to that system.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.610
Which, of course, prevents programs,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.050
malicious programs in particular,
Keyloggers.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.890
A quick example of they're trying
to log your key strokes or

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.920
keys that you press to figure out
your password or whatever it is.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.390
So, it prevents these kind of programs
from tapping the path from keyboard

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.962
where you press your keys to the system
where the key presses are captured.

00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:17.950
This path has to be trusted,
and a result of that trust

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.000
is that malicious programs are not going
to be able to gain access to it and

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.210
be able to tap and see the information
that is being sent over it.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.520
The next thing we have,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.150
in terms of functionality features,
we didn't talk about that.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.610
A lot of our focus has been on
the prevention side, the idea that,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.770
you know, authentication makes
sure it's the right person.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.010
Access control says the right
person gets access to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.790
a resource that is getting requested.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.850
The thing is that, no matter
how hard we work at prevention.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.630
Things could go wrong.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.020
Somebody can steal your password,
for example.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.130
And they can login as you.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.470
If we keep an audit log
of what has happened,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.610
what objects have been accessed,
when, by whom.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.370
Well this sort of an audit log can
come in handy when, and some abuse or

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.550
misuse might actually take place.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.630
So, prevention, if it's not 100%,
then you have to go to detection, and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.570
having a log will help
you with that detection.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.397
Typically, detection is that for

00:02:18.397 --> 00:02:23.180
some definition of unusual,
you see some unusual activity in

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.450
the system that potentially means
an attacker has gained access to it and

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.950
that unusual use can be,
an analysis that you do,

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.970
that detection is possible when you have
a recorder log of what the system did.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.600
Keep in mind that this will only be
useful if we actually look at the log

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.330
and you're able to correctly
assess when there is an abuse.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.390
So although audit, we're not going to
talk a great deal about that here,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.010
but Lamson, one of the pioneers
who worked in security,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.620
actually had this thing called
the gold standard of security.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.200
This was based on the three AUs.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.770
The authentication,
the authorization, and finally audit.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.270
Periodic table symbol for gold is AU.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.460
So the three AUs actually define
the gold standard for security.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.120
And the third AU typically is
audit function that system.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.220
So I said it's useful
only if you look at it,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.290
but also it's only useful if malicious
programs are not able to tamper with it.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.650
Okay, so it's integrity obviously
is going to be important.
