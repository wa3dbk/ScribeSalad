00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.280
So, here I have two curves, okay, f1 and

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.670
f2, and those are meant to be
as taken in two different times.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.410
And, here I'm just looking at
this point, x0, and, just so

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.290
you understand, this is the value at,
if you will, time two.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.940
This is the value at time one,
and that's true for all of these.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.090
And the question is,
how much does the curve move?

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.400
So, what I have to do is,
I want to find this displacement at x0.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.150
All right, so do it as follows.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.410
So, here's how we do it.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.010
We initialize, since this is iterative,
we have to initialize.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.060
We'll first start by assuming
that our displacement was 0.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.760
That is u and v are all 0's everywhere.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.260
That's great,
that makes the work really, really fast.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.520
I don't do anything,
it's the original picture.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.510
Now I have to estimate the next one,

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.160
d1 by figuring out what
the new displacement is.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.990
That's what this new little
delta d is going to be.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.200
So how do I do that?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.950
Well I have to compute
these tangents and

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.850
you can see the tangents
are right there, okay?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.170
And what I do is,
based upon that tangent, come down here.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.550
It says oh, okay,
if this thing were actually a plane,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.500
this amount, that's my d hat.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.110
That's the amount I have to displace
over in order to line up these points.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.667
That's assuming this thing were a plane.

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:22.350
If we really were a plane, that would be
the amount that I would have to move.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.750
So let me do that displacement and
I end up there.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.730
So now I've got my d1 which was
just d0 plus my new estimate.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.583
And guess what?

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:36.125
I have to do it again so now I take a
look and say I have to move this amount.

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:40.160
So I add that to my d,
and I move it that much.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.110
And guess what?

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.840
I do it again.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.930
Estimate tiny little d hat, this time.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.830
And voila.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.670
It turns out that f1 of x minus d3
is almost exactly f2 at this point.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.220
Okay?

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.500
That's the iterative refinement.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.060
And the only thing that
it takes in order to do

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.850
this iterative Lukas-Kanade beyond
the regular one is this warping step.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.810
Given some UV that you've
computed between one image and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.810
the next, take that first image,
warp it through that, that flow field.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.890
And now you'll have almost the second
image, and you just apply it over again
