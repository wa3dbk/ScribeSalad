00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There's nothing particularly innocuous about this statement.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
X is already in scope. In fact, it's 3, so this is going to assign x to be 4.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I don't think this will prevent us from printing "sindbad".

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This one, though, says x is x divided by 0.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Division by 0 doesn't really make sense

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and will typically cause the Python interpreter to stop and say,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
"You are asking me to do impossible math,"

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and thus not execute subsequent statements.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Assigning x the string value "return" doesn't have the same effect

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
as actually executing a return statement, so this won't help us.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But x = y, well, if this is the entire program,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
then there is no y in scope, so Python will yell at us and say,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
"Oh, you're referencing an undefined variable."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So just to make these examples clear, let's actually see it in the interpreter.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This time I've left in x = x + 1, which should not prevent us from seeing Sindbad.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And there he is. But if I print out x = x / 0, no, we don't get Sindbad

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and instead we get this error message from Python,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah"--the part here at the bottom is the most important--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
"ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero."

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Well, we did ask you to do that, so it's our own fault.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Similarly, x = y we don't see Sindbad and instead we see

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
"NameError: global name 'y' is not defined."

00:01:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So both of those 2 errors caused us not to see Sindbad.
