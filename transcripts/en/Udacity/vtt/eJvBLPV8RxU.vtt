00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.828
Thinking about the numbers we have in our lovely chart over here. And about

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:09.515
what kind of functions p and q are, linear ones. What kind of curve do you

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:14.680
think pq of x is? Is it a vertical line, a horizontal line, a straight line

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.979
with a nonzero slope, a parabola or a cubic curve?
