So hopefully, this quiz is a little bit easier than the last one we did. What

00:00:04.306 --> 00:00:08.526
we're trying to do first, is just identify the terms that have w in them. So,

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:12.845
going through our equation up here, we see 36w and 51w. And we can just fill

00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:15.067
those in to these first two slots.

00:00:15.068 --> 00:00:19.457
Remember that it doesn't matter which order we write them in. It doesn't matter

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:23.786
if we write 36w or 51w first, because of the commutative property of addition.

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:28.007
Next we need to identify the n terms, so those are the two that are left, 22n

00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:32.350
and 50n. And we just want to write those in these two slots. Again, order does

00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:36.613
not matter because we're just going to add everything together. I'm just going

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:40.717
to put the 22n first, since 22 happens to be my favorite number. The last step

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.506
to make this a fully blown equation, is to add in our plus or minus signs

00:00:44.518 --> 00:00:48.726
between the terms. Here, in the top equation, every term is positive. We don't

00:00:48.738 --> 00:00:52.863
see any negative signs here. So that means that each of these signs is going to

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:56.967
be a plus sign. When we switch terms around, there's no change to the value of

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:57.889
each term.

00:00:57.892 --> 00:01:01.270
Nothing is going to become negative that used to be positive. So the only thing

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:04.677
that's different about this bottom equation from this top equation is the order

00:01:04.688 --> 00:01:06.023
that we've written the terms in.
