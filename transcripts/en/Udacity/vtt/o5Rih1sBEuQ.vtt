And that's pretty much all there is to the basics of OCL.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.180
We have some Built-in Types, Booleans, Integers, Reals, and

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.380
Strings. We have the ability to express literals of those types. And

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.730
we have some Built-in Operations on those types. So we can combine Booleans with

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.240
your favorite, Boolean operators ands, and ors, and so on. We can add and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.130
subtract and multiply integers and reals. And we can we can deal with strings,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.369
we can convert them to upper case or we can concatenate them together.
