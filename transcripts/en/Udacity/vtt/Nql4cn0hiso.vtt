00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.296
Now we're on to our fourth practice problem. What do you think the solutions

00:00:03.296 --> 00:00:06.954
would be for this radical equation? Notice we have a constant in front of this

00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:10.951
radical sign. We can leave this in front of the radical, we just want to make

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:16.914
sure when we square both sides, we square the 4 and we square the radical. Try

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:19.890
it out on your own, and then see if you can find the correct answers, or maybe

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.970
there's just one answer, or no answer. Good luck.
