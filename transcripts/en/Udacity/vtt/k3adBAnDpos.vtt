00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.033
To define an orthographic camera in 3GS you do two operations. One is to define

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:08.436
a volume in space. The other is to move and orient that volume of space as you

00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:12.278
wish. This first piece of code creates the orthographic camera and defines the

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:16.290
rectangular box of space it's viewing. This box is defined by the left to right

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.974
width limits. The top-to-bottom height limits and front-to-back limits, all in

00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:26.443
world-space coordinates. These correspond to the x, y, and z axes. The camera

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:29.990
can be thought of being positioned on the plus z end of the box defined.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.913
Looking down the minus z axis, with upting the y plus direction, as usual. For

00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:37.033
convenience, I define a view size, which is how much vertical space I'd like to

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:41.198
fit in the view. The aspect ratio is just that, what's called the aspect ratio

00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:45.490
of the window. It describes how wide the view is compared to how high it is.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.089
For example, if your view was 1000 pixel wide and 500 high the aspect ratio

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.410
would be equal to 2. In other words you'd want your box to be twice as wide as

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.380
it is tall. If you don't, you'll get a stretch view of the world, which is

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.992
probably not what you wanted. What all this code does is defines a box in

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:03.878
space. In this case it happens to be centered around the origin. By the way,

00:01:03.878 --> 00:01:07.102
I've seen some demos just use the camera's width and height directly as the

00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:11.513
camera size. Don't do this. You're setting the camera size in your scene in

00:01:11.513 --> 00:01:14.615
world coordinates which is most definitely not the same as the width and height

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:18.976
as your canvas in pixels. If we stopped here and put our drinking bird in the

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:22.156
scene, we'd get a side view of the bird. What we'd now like to do is position

00:01:22.156 --> 00:01:25.986
and orient this camera in space to make a more interesting view. This code does

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:27.050
that. The first

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.380
[UNKNOWN]

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.452
moves the box by this amount. It's a translation. The same as for a normal

00:01:30.452 --> 00:01:34.076
object. The camera controls code does two things. First, it sets up what sort

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:37.681
of mouse controller you want for the camera, if any. I came up with this custom

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:40.894
orbit and pan controls class, extending the orbit controls class I found in

00:01:40.894 --> 00:01:45.620
3JS. This control keeps the camera oriented, so that the plus y axis is always

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.246
up. For a more unconstrained, but trickier to use control, the trackball

00:01:49.246 --> 00:01:53.146
controls class could be specified instead. In either case, the next line sets

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:57.170
the target for the camera. The target is the location being looked at. This

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.880
defines a new z axis direction for the Camera. The Y axis kept pointing up as

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.137
best as possible. We'll talk about that later, when we look at the matrices

00:02:04.137 --> 00:02:07.636
forming this camera. Once we've positioned this box in space it defines what

00:02:07.636 --> 00:02:11.130
part of the scene we want to render. Whatever happens to be inside this box is

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.527
what we'll see on the screen. The z buffer is applied as usual so that objects

00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:18.258
that are closer to the camera cover up what's behind them. This is just an

00:02:18.258 --> 00:02:21.614
overview of the basic idea. The camera defines a chunk of space defining it's

00:02:21.614 --> 00:02:24.342
limits and this chunk then gets positioned and oriented in space to make an

00:02:24.342 --> 00:02:28.440
image. I'll go over this process in detail in the following lessons
