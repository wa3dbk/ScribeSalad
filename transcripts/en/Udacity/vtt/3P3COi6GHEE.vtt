00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.680
For me, one really neat thing about
the bitonic sorting algorithm is that it

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.560
has this nice visual representation,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.740
which connects it to the dynamic
multithreading model.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.920
You've also seen that it has
a fixed regular parallel structure.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.350
So, you could imagine a very
natural implementation using, for

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.380
instance, the old programmable
data rays or fpgas.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.370
Now the regular structure also
means that it will map well to

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.680
fixed data parallel hardware.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.910
So this includes stuff like sim-D or

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.560
vector processing systems as well
as graphics coprocessors or GPUs.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.960
The downside is that
it is not work optimal

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.930
even when restricted to the class
of comparison based algorithms.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.700
So in practice, you'll have to make
an engineering tradeoff based on

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.910
the platform and
the scale that you're interested in.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.630
The best way to try and understand this
tradeoff is to try implementing these

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.045
and competing algorithms on real
systems and see what happens.

00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:56.580
So until we meet again friends, Cheers.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.759
Delicious.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:03.648
[LAUGH]
Mm.

00:01:03.648 --> 00:01:04.352
Mm.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.660
All right, I can totally do this.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.252
I can totally do this.

00:01:11.252 --> 00:01:11.974
Shh.

00:01:11.974 --> 00:01:16.066
Ssh, don't be so loud.

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.882
[SOUND] Ha!

00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:21.210
See, I told you.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.240
You.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.180
Am I offscreen?

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.940
Am I even onscreen?

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.630
I don't know.
It's like butter.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.170
Like butter in a glass.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.800
It's like you I love you
