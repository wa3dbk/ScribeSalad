00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Narrator] For this quiz your goal is to define a procedure named replace_spy

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that takes as its input a list of 3 numbers and modifies the value of the third element

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in input list to be 1 more than its previous value.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
To solve this quiz you're going to have to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
experiment and understand how values are past procedures in Python.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Something we haven't talked about yet, but if you solve this quiz

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you'll have a good understanding of how things might work.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The behavior that we want is shown in an example,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so if the value of spy is the list 0, 0, 7,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we call the procedure replace spy, passing in spy.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Note that we're not using the result.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We're not assigning this back into a variable spy.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We're just calling replace spy, but after the call

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the value that spy refers to has changed.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now it has the value 0, 0, 8.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, I haven't yet told you what it means to pass a mutable object

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
like a list to a procedure, but try to define replace spy

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and see if you can figure out what happens.
