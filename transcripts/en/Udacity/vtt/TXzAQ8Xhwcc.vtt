00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The cosine outputs the ratio of 2 lengths

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which means that the unit of measurement that the cosine returns is 1.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The cosine does not return meters or kilograms, it returns bare numbers.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So whatever is in front of that cosine determines the measurement unit of the result.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The result is not measured in days.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can immediately reject these.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The result is measured in meters.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It can only be this one or that one.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The cosine and the sine range between -1 and +1.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you multiply by something x 10⁻⁹m,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We would be dealing with very, very tiny lengths.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That's not what we are into here.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It has to be the first one.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is the radius of the orbit of the moon around the earth.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let me do these in reverse order.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The radius of the orbit of the moon should not appear inside here.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This has to do with the period of the moon's orbit.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
How long does it take the moon to make one full orbit around earth?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
27 days. It must not be the meters.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Which is also clear from the units.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If we have meters in here, something has to cancel the meters.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We have to have an angle in here.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If we speak of radians, again, something without measurements units.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
There must not be any measurement unit in here.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If it were meters, these meters would have to cancel somehow.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
How would I do that?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Not with time, obviously. Seconds or days don't cancel with meters.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Once we are here, it's clear that we have to use the division.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Days divided by days.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This gets rid of the measurement units.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We can't mulitiply by days, otherwise we would be getting days squared.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And the remaining choice, 2π x t.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Not this one. Not this one.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
If we let t grow by 27 days, 1 complete period,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the numerator increases by 2π x 27 days.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And this ratio increases by 2π x 27 days, divided by 27 days, by 2π.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
As t advances by one period, this ratio advances by 2π,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
but that's precisely what we need for cosine and sine.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The angle has to advance by 2π 360°.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
One full revolution.
