00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.420
So now that we know how to
find the block offset and

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.000
the block number,
let's talk about the cache tags,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.860
which is how we determine which block
do we actually have in the cache.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.430
So our cache can contain
some number of lines.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.059
In this case, we have a four-line cache.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.040
We could have something for example,
64 bytes of data in each line.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.200
Let's say that any block from memory can
be placed in any of these four lines.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.800
In that case, when we are given
the address by the processor,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.110
the least significant bits
of the address will tell us

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.380
where in the line we
are after we find the line.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.460
But each of these lines in the cache

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.770
could contain any block
number from the memory.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.840
So the question is,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.370
how do we find whether our access
is actually a cache tag or not?

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.780
And the answer is, in addition to
the data of the blocks, the cache

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.720
also keeps a so-called tag that tells
it which block does it have here?

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.540
In this particular cache,
the tag will contain the block number

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.970
that the cache has in
each of these slots.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.630
So we need four tags because there
could be four blocks in this cache.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.430
So given the address, we take the block
number part of the address and

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.670
compare it to each of the tags
we have in our cache.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.800
If one of these says one, that means
that the tag matches the block number

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.200
and that means that our data is in
the corresponding line in the cache.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.340
Let's say that this is the situation
we have, so we have a tag match here.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.650
That means that we have a hit and
that our data is here in the cache.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.720
Now we can use the block offset to tell
us where in that line our data is and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.320
we take the data and
supply it to the processor.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.960
In this particular cache, we have
the offset part of the address here,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.630
and the block number is, in this case,
called the tag part of the address.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.950
When we have a cache miss, we will bring
the data here and we will put the block

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.919
number in the corresponding tag so
that we can find this block later.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:13.790
We will see later that sometimes
the tag part of the address

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.890
is not exactly the same as the block
number, but in this cache it is.
