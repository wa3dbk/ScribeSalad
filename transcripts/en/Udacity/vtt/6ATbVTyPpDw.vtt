00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.980
Like so many concepts with refinement necessary in sufficient conditions, for

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.640
typical concepts in typical conditions, what about exemplar concepts?

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.180
Exemplar concepts don't even have typical conditions, let alone necessary and

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.120
sufficient conditions. In case of exemplar concepts, I can give you examples.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.670
Perhaps I can do some implicit abstraction of some examples, but

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.060
it's about as far as I can go. Consider the example of beauty for a second.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.160
There are four examples of something beautiful. Here's a painting by Van Gogh,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.150
here's a beautiful sunset, a beautiful flower, a beautiful dance and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.700
so on. While I can give examples of the concept of beauty,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.010
it's really hard to come up with the typical condition of a beauty.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.590
Exemplar concepts are very hard to, define. And for that reason, they

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.590
are also very hard to, communicate to each other, or to teach in a art program.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.570
Exemplar concepts can be culture specific, sometimes even individual specific.
