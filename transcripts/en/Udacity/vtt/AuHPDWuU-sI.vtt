00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.370
There are some additional advanced features of class models. Four that I'd like

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.350
to just briefly mention are interfaces, parametrized classes, nested classes,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.620
and composite objects. If you're familiar with an object-oriented language like

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.000
Java, you know that you can express in your program,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
a type by using the interface construct within Java.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.520
In UML you can also have interfaces. And in those interface descriptions,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.610
you typically describe what that interface provides to the rest of

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.460
the system and what it requires from the rest of the system.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.275
Parameterized classes correspond to Java generics or

00:00:50.275 --> 00:00:56.460
C++ templates. That is, that is they provide a way of, for example,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.604
describing collection classes by giving a parameter that is a type of the class.

00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:07.940
You have a set of vehicles, you have a set of bank accounts. Thirdly,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.190
our nested classes. If you're familiar with Java,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.830
you know that within a Java class definition, you can have other classes.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.580
These are sometimes called nested classes or inner classes. And

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.620
UML provides a feature for describing those situations. Finally, you can have

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.830
composite objects. These are objects that contain other objects within them.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.360
Diagram allows you to express this by having class diagrams that have

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.690
class rectangles that have other class rectangles in them. As I said,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.587
these are advanced features just so that you're aware that they're there.
