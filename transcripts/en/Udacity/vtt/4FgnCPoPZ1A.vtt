00:00:00.205 --> 00:00:02.896
Let's talk about some different techniques for scaling, different approaches

00:00:02.896 --> 00:00:05.900
you might take in, in a particular problem. So the

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.816
first thing you should think about is optimizing your code.

00:00:08.816 --> 00:00:11.610
You know, if, if, if you have the option between

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.780
buying a second machine, and figuring out how to have

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.080
two machines working together on your website versus making your

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.370
code twice as fast. You know, may, maybe it's, maybe

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.230
it's easier to optimize your code. You know there are

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.520
some trade-offs here. The cost of a machine plus the maintenance

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.910
of having multiple machines. That means you need to figure out, you

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.250
know, you have to administrate those machines. Make sure they're up,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.200
configure them, make two machines work together, all of that stuff. Versus

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.870
cost per developer. That is development time. You know, it takes,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.650
takes some effort to optimize your code. And you know, paying people

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.910
to do that or paying yourself or you know, considering the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.240
value of your own time for optimizing code versus adding another machine,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.330
you know, there's a trade-off there.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.060
And that's something you should think about.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.360
At my company, that's something we think a lot about. You know, what does

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.880
it cost to pay a developer, and what does it cost just to add

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.510
another machine? So, kind of a big trade off there. We're not going to spend

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.920
a whole lot of time on this code optimization in this lecture. Because that's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.790
really just learning how to program better. You know, as you get more experience

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.880
programming, you'll be able to write better and, and, and tighter code. And it,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.360
you know as you understand how compilers work, you can start getting even more

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.790
clever and et cetera, et cetera. So, won't be covering it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.220
in this lecture, but you'll get better at it as, as

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.080
you develop as an engineer. Another technique is caching complex operations.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.672
We are going to spend a lot of time on this in

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:29.540
this [LAUGH] lecture so I'm not going to say a whole lot

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.920
about it now, but this is the name of the game. Caching.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.640
You can upgrade your machines, which basically means, you know, you're

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.460
replacing the machines you're using now with machines that have, more memory,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.120
more disk space, faster CPU. Now this is often a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.690
good option. Sometimes you don't have this option at all if

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.390
you're using you know, a shared, shared platform where you don't

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.550
have control of the machines. But again, you know, some, some

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.830
you know, every couple of years machines get substantially faster,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.510
memory gets cheaper, disk space gets cheaper. CPUs come in faster

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.880
varieties and, and greater numbers. So again, you know, just like

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.340
you're doing the tradeoff with code optimization versus adding more machines.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.550
You have the same trade off here. Do we want to optimize the code,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.460
or do we want to just get a faster computer? This is a perfectly fine

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.670
way to scale. In fact, it's one of the easiest ways to scale

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.750
if you have a, a system for replacing one machine with another without breaking

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.010
your website. Or maybe you might want to break your website for a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.867
little bit while you do this. So anyway, something to keep in mind. Sometimes

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:27.030
it's an option, sometimes it's not. You know, It's not as fun as

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.950
optimizing your code, but it's often cheaper

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.200
and easier. And finally, another approach is

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.035
to add more machines, which we will also spending a

00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:38.343
fair amount of time on in this lecture. You know

00:02:38.343 --> 00:02:41.430
that optimizing code, and upgrading machines are fairly straightforward. You

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.100
know, do it when you can. Caching and dealing with multiple

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.810
machines working together in a system are more difficult but

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.680
ultimately you'll have to do them as your website gets large

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.890
enough. And that is what we'll be spending the most

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.340
time on in these lectures, how these two things fit together.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.020
Okay, so let's move on to caching.
