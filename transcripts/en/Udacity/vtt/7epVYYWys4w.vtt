Hi, I'm Ido Green.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.850
I'm a Developer Advocate at Google.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.950
&gt;&gt; And I'm Cameron Pittman.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.260
I make front-end courses
here at Udacity.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.750
&gt;&gt; Cameron and I want to help you
a bit with the forms, because almost

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.730
any meaningful experience on the webs
come with boxes that need to be filled.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.600
&gt;&gt; It might be a registration form,
a shopping cart or a sign in form.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.260
All of these need simple forms.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.090
And why?

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.170
Well, it's because
the simpler the form is,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.090
the more conversions
you're going to see.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.060
&gt;&gt; Right, and in fact,
according to Chrome usage data,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.260
you can make forms 30% faster by
just making them ready to autofill.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.160
We will dive into it
in the second lesson.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.040
For now, just remember that with
faster forms comes happier users and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.570
more conversion.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.740
And that's why we're here.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.230
This course is all about best practices
for designing and developing forms.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.390
We want you to build
forms that work great for

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.320
all your users, no matter their
platform, mobile or desktop.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.160
However, mobile platforms are a bit
more of a challenge due to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.770
the smaller screen size.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.629
So we are going to focus on
that more in this course.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.570
&gt;&gt; Yes, and for this course, Ido and
I expect that you're a web developer who

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.590
understands the fundamentals of HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.010
We expect that you've been
building sites with forms, and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.800
you're always trying to stay up
to date with best practices.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.895
&gt;&gt; In the first two lessons,

00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:17.020
you'll be learning about
inputs that make up forms.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.570
All the little button and
toggles that clutter your user screens.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.930
&gt;&gt; And in the third lesson,
you'll take on forms as a whole and

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.540
examine what you can do
to convert more users.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.570
This is especially important for
e-commerce sites, but

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.300
it certainly applies to
any kind of long form.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.230
&gt;&gt; In the last lesson, you'll make forms
reactive and touchable for mobile users.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.620
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a lot of fun.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.260
Let's get started.
