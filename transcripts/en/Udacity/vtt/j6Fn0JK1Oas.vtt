00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.860
To get a feel for the distinguishing
language features of Objective-C.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.040
Let's start by comparing and
contrasting it with swift.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.650
We aren't going to exhaustively
catalog the similarities and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.740
differences between the languages.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.480
Instead I'd like you to focus on
two essential similarities and

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.198
three key differences.

00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:21.600
Objective-C and Swift share the IOS
frameworks and design patterns but

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.390
they differ substantially
in their handling of nil,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.890
their approach to mutability,
and object typing.
