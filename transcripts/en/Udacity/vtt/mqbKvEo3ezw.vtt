00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] The answer for this one may be a little surprising.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The answer is 3, here's why: the first statement creates the list

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with the elements 1, 2, and P refers to that list.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The second statement creates the list with the elements 3, 4

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and assigns that to the variable Q:

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The third statement appends a new element on the list P.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That element is the list with 2 elements,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but what actually happens is not adding 2 elements to P.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What happens with append is we're just appending 1 new element.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That element happens to be a list.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The way this looks is we have a new element in P.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The value of that element is actually the list object that Q refers to.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's why the length of P is 3.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's try this in the Python interpreter.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Here we see the list that's created.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We can see that the length of that list is 3.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What do you think will happen if we try an assignment like this?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We're replacing the element at position 1 of Q with the value 5.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Does that change the value of P?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It does, and if you remember the picture we drew,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it's not surprising that it does.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Remember that the object we had created, the third element of P,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
is actually a reference to this object containing the elements 3, 4,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
which is the same list object that Q references.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
When we change the value in position 1 of Q

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that also changes the value of P.
