The best way to become familiar with objects is to use lots of them. Here, we

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.970
will look at strings and we will do it in three ways. With BlueJ objects, with

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.370
Java code, and with another nifty tool called the code pad. In the code pad, as

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.560
you'll see in a minute, I can type in code and have it executed right away

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.650
without having to compile anything, or without having to click on the bubbles.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.110
The code pad is so nifty that it's a shame that it's hidden, to reveal it,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.670
select View and Show Code Pad. And then they make it so small, which is also a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.890
shame. Let's make it much, much bigger. In the code pad I can write regular

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.580
Java statements. Here I declare a variable, here I have a print statement. And

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.570
as soon as I hit the Enter key, it gets executed. You see a window pops up that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.040
has the output. But what's even better, any value that I type in here gets

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.760
displayed right away. Let me show you. I type river.length, and the answer 11

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.130
is displayed as soon as I hit the Enter key. It's important that you don't type

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.350
a semi-colon because otherwise the code pad thinks that you have a statement

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.130
like up here. No semicolon tells it that it should immediately print the value

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.275
of the code that you write. Here I type the name of the variable without a

00:01:29.275 --> 00:01:35.790
semicolon, and it's printed the string Mississippi. And to the left, I have a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.750
little blob that I can drag into the workbench. Here it goes. I drop it into

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.860
the workbench. Now I'm supposed to give it a name. I'll give it the same name,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:56.750
that the variable has river. And over here I have a familiar BlueJ blob. That I

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.410
can manipulate in the usual way. I can right click on it, and now the string

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.200
class has many, many methods, but I want to call length. When I select the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.170
length method I get the answer 11. So I can get the same answer in two

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.000
different ways. Which one is better? It really depends. Sometimes I prefer to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.330
use the BlueJ bubbles for quick experimentation, because you can't really make

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.040
any typos. Sometimes I prefer to use the code pad. Because it's just easier to

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.490
type in, maybe to copy and paste in, what you want. Both of those are great for

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.250
experimenting with classes and objects, and to just find out what happens when

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.340
you call a particular method. You should try them both and see which one you

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.440
like better. Of course for more hardcore programming. For writing a program

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.240
that gets repeated over and over again, one wants to write an actual Java class

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.320
with a main method. In that case, as you know, you right click on the empty

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:12.710
space, make a new class, right click, open the editor. And start typing. Then

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.880
you put your code into the main method. Here I wrote a couple of lines of code

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.760
that let me compute the length of this string. You compile. You run. And you

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.200
get the answer. That's more work at first, and it'll pay off when you write a

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.350
longer program. For short explorations, the object bubbles and the code pad are

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.670
hard to beat. So go ahead. Fire up BlueJ and work along with Sara to explore

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.790
the string class and its methods.
