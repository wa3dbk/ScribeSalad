A pinhole camera captures an image upside down. In computer graphics we think of

00:00:04.182 --> 00:00:08.047
a camera a bit differently with the image being formed in front of the viewer.

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:11.492
This is a more convenient way to consider the task of image generation. For

00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:15.242
starters, now the object projects onto our screen right side up. This

00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:19.246
pyramid-shaped view of the world is called the view frustum. Frustum means a

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:23.528
pyramid with its top chopped off. It is one of the most frequently misspelled

00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:27.882
words in computer graphics. So, lock it in your brain now. There's no letter r

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:31.862
in the last half of that word. I suspect it sneaks in there because of the r in

00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:35.850
the word frustrate or maybe the word fulcrum. Anyway, enough about that. The

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.304
point here is that we want to know how much light is coming from each direction.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:43.165
Each light emits photons which bounce around the world and may get absorbed or

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:47.083
otherwise changed. In a camera we gather photons from the world and these create

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:50.876
a photograph. In computer graphics, we simulate the real world as best we can

00:00:50.876 --> 00:00:54.670
and try to determine how many photons are coming in each direction. Whatever

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.553
amount of light we gather from a direction, we record at a pixel in the screen.
