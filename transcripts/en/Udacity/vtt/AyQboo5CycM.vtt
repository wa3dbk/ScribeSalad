00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.440
The web service layer refers
to the protocols that can sit

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.530
on top of the application layer and

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.360
can determine the format in which
APIs are sent and received.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.400
One of the most popular protocols
at this level is the simple

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.300
object access protocol, or SOAP.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.910
SOAP uses the extensible markup language
to transmit sets of information

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.650
in the form of objects.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.710
SOAP most commonly sits atop
the HTTP application protocol, but

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.500
can also function with SMTP, or
the simple male transfer protocol.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.270
REST, a representational state transfer,
is the up and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.430
coming alternative to SOAP.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.780
REST is more of a set of styles and
guidelines than a protocol,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.630
since it leverages the features of
HTTP in order to transmit information.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.640
HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, and

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.270
DELETE, handle the management
of a server's resources.
