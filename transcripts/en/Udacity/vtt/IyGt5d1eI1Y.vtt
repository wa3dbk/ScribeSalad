00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.790
In the credit card class, we can look at the pseudo

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.990
code, and find that it first sets sum, and count to zero.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.030
That's already there. These lines are the same as what we

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.530
had before, for computing the sum of every other digit. The for

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.040
each digit starting from the right part, is getting pretty familiar

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.572
now. I'll keep the code for controlling the number of erasions in

00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:22.620
place. But now, instead of just always adding digit to the

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.840
sum. I need to check whether the count is even or odd.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.457
And before I even get the digit, I want to

00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:31.330
make sure I remember the increment count. Now [SOUND], if

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.530
count is odd [SOUND], I add the digit to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.350
the sum. Otherwise, count is even and if the digit

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.470
is less than five, I add twice the digit

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.910
to the sum. In the last case. Count is even

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.290
and the digit is greater than five [SOUND]. And I

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.970
want to add twice the digit [SOUND], and then subtract nine.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.300
This is all just matching that pseudo code.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.000
Now, instead of just returning false, I need to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.998
return [SOUND] whether the last digit of n. Is

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:04.610
zero, or not. The last digit of n is

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:12.533
zero when sum mod ten is zero. For example, if sum were 24, then sum mod ten

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:17.160
would be four, which is not zero, and the card would not be valid. But if sum is

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.650
40, then sum mod ten is zero. And the

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.360
card is valid. So this would return true. Looks

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.890
like I forgot to change my pseudo code into

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.500
real code. Count is odd, if count mod two is

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.920
one. And now I'll run the tester. And it

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.740
looks like, for at least the examples that we've

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.650
used, my code is returning true when true is

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.160
expected. And false when false is expected. Here's some food

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.120
for thought. Does this guarantee that my code is correct?
