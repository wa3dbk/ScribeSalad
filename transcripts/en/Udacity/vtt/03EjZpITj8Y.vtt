00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.914
So if you're really thinking like a Pythonista, I think you'll be able to answer

00:00:03.914 --> 00:00:07.448
this quiz even though I haven't explained it yet. So, what do you think a

00:00:07.448 --> 00:00:11.936
ValueError is, as was raised in this example? So, here are the choices, it could

00:00:11.936 --> 00:00:17.100
be something really special, unlike anything we've seen before in Python. It

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.394
could be a str that describes an error. It could be an object that is an

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:26.343
instance of the Exception type. It could be an object that is an instance of the

00:00:26.343 --> 00:00:31.333
IOError type. It could be an object that is an instance of the ValueError type.

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:35.563
And I'll tell you the hint that exactly two of these are correct.
