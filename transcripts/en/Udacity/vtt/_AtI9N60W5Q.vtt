00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.660
Now, the second of our 3 pillars is going to be

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.670
compute performance. And, to get a sense of how your application is

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.710
actually spending it's time during a given frame, you really want

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.260
to check out the timeline tab inside of Chrome developer tools. How

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.070
this works, is that you actually load the timeline, hit this

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.310
beautiful record button down here on the bottom, and then watch magic

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.480
unfold. So, let's take look at how this plays out with

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.040
Biolad Disaster. If I start the game, it goes up very simple.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.740
Now, when I hit the record button down here on the bottom, you

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.600
can actually see that it's logging all of the event information that's occurring

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.060
while this game is happening. Now, I'm not doing anything, I want to point

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.220
that out, yet events are actually being fired. So, let's take a look at

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.820
what's actually going on under the hood here. So, if I size this

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.350
up, I can actually see the number of events inside of my window

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.610
and drill down into what's going on. So, I've an animation frame here.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.280
And if I expand that, you can see that there's actually a request animation

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.660
frame that has occurred at that point. Now,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.340
you'll notice down here on the bottom that there's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.200
actually different type of check boxes to filter

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.410
out what events you're looking at. And each one

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.720
has a respective color. For example, loading is

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.560
blue, scripting is gold, rendering is purple and painting

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.300
is green. So, if I toggle painting you can

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.870
see that those events actually disappear from the timeline.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.980
Now, I did another quick little capture while you weren't looking,

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.520
I saw you going to get peanuts from the bag. Now, if

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.380
I slide my visibility window to another part of the timeline,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.060
you can see that there's actually a little block here that seems

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.900
to be wider than all the other blocks around it, what

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.630
this implies is that there's some scripting occurring between our windows here

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.200
that is taking longer than the other frames. Now, below us, we

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.230
actually have a list of events that occurred, plus as you remember

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.400
these little triangles that allows us to drill down into the

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.900
event. On here in the side, you can see that we

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.960
have the same animation Frame Fire that we saw earlier, but

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.810
the new one that we see showing up, is a GC Event,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.450
where 1.4 megabytes of data was actually collected. Hovering over it

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.815
brings a popup dialogue that shows you that this actually took

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:58.820
2.7 milliseconds, out of our frame budget to actually do a

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.170
garbage collection event. That's why you can see that this block here,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.300
is actually larger then the block next to it, because

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.670
we have an extra 2.7 miliseconds that went to do

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.170
a garbage collection event. We can actually see this mirrored,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.293
by clicking on the memory option for the timeline. Now, what

00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:17.630
this's actually going to show us is a linear graph of

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.720
where allocations are actually occuring, and lo and behold, you can

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.710
see, between our 2 divets here, when that GC event

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.620
occurs, the amount of memory allocated in our application drops down,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.700
thus showing the garbage collection freed memory. Now, I want to show

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.560
you what this looks like live, because it's really interesting to watch.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.200
How an application, actually allocates its memory. So, you can see

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.780
that over time, this application, when I'm doing nothing on the screen,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.410
is actually allocating about 1 megabyte every second or so. And

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.290
then you can see the garbage collector actually kicks in, and frees

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.680
a lot of that data. This type of sawtooth pattern that

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.730
you're seeing along the timeline here, is very common in different web

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.030
applications, that do a lot of dynamic allocation of objects. Now, there's an

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.590
article out there that I've written on HTML 5 Rocks, that details different ways

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.630
to address this type of sawtooth pattern,

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.020
using object pools. But, we're not going to

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.520
go into that right now. Let's stay focused on what's in front of us.
