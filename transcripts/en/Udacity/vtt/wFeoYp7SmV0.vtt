Hello and welcome to this new lesson on Java interfaces. The purpose of Java

00:00:06.074 --> 00:00:10.627
interfaces is to let us unify common behavior. Let me give you an example of

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:15.442
what I mean with common behavior. Here, I have a sample program that draws a

00:00:15.442 --> 00:00:19.537
delightful suburban scene with houses, and dogs and we'll add other suburban

00:00:19.537 --> 00:00:26.410
items to the mix soon enough. Let's look at the code. We have a list of houses,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:34.074
we add a couple of houses. We have a list of dogs, we add a few dogs. Then we

00:00:34.074 --> 00:00:39.000
draw the houses and we draw the dogs. Now, we have to put the houses and the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.499
dogs into separate ArrayLists because they're objects of different types. I

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:49.050
can't put a dog in an ArrayList of houses or a house into an ArrayList of dogs.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.452
Our suburban scene would not be complete without cars, so go ahead and add a

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:59.780
few cars to our program. One for this house and the other two for the Mcmansion

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.510
over here.
