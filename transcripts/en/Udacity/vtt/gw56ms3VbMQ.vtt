00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Alternate history is a genre of fiction where we explore what would have happened to the world

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
had some historical event turned out differently.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For example, we might have an alternate history now exploring

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
what would have happened if the Allies hadn't won World War II.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What we're going to do is look at a few alternate history examples where we're going to try

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to explore the question, "What would've happened if certain groups of people in the past had used

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
random testing in addition to whatever other kinds of testing they were doing?"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And we're going to sort of specifically focus on the question, "Would random testing have been likely

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to alter the outcome of some famous software bugs but would have not made much difference?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Would it have not been a very useful technique?"

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And so the first case study we're going to look at is the FDIV bug in Intel Pentium chips.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And so in 1994, it came to the world's attention that the FDIV instruction supported by

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Intel's Pentium processor was flawed and so FDIV is an instruction that you would use

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to perform floating point division.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If we're writing an assembly language for a Pentium, we would issue the FDIV instruction

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
with two operands and what do we do is compute the quotient of a divided by b.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And so what happened is there's a bug in FDIV.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And what had happened was the implementation of FDIV, that is to say

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the hardware implementation of this machine instruction was intended to be very fast.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The Pentium was at that time a very high performance processor.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And the way FDIV was fast, at least in part, was because it did part of its work using table lookups.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So there was this table of values stored in the Pentium's hardware.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What had happened was somewhere on the way to fabrication

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
some of the values had not been loading correctly into the table.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So part of the lookup table, I believe it was 5 entries, contained the wrong results.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And for some values of A and B passed to the FDIV instruction, looking up these wrong results

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in the lookup table would cause it to do the wrong thing.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This wasn't an extremely major error in the sense that it would return a million instead of 0

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but rather it was off in sort of some number of places after the decimal point.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The reason that the flaws in FDIV went undetected for sometime was that only about

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
1 in 9 Billion randomly selected inputs would actually trigger the bug.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And so now the question we need to ask ourselves is given this relatively low observed failure rate

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
on random inputs, would random testing have been a good way to find the Pentium FDIV bug?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And the answer is almost certainly yes.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So what we're going to do now is try to figure out about how long it would've taken Intel

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to find this bug using random testing.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And so the first thing we're going to need to do is make an assumption about

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
how many tests per second they can run.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And so it's not as if in 1994 they have modern multigigahertz hardware available

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
but rather these Pentiums ran at around 60 MHz.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And so what we're going to say for the sake of argument is that it took 10 Ã‚Ä¾s

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to perform an FDIV and verify its result.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So in other words, at 60 MHz, I'm assuming that it would take about 600 cycles

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
to check a particular input for FDIV.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Now let's try to work out the math.
