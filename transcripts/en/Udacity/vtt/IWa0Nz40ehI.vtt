00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.610
There's a number of ways that we
might consider risk in this scenario.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.440
Let's look at first, this idea of what's
the chance you might lose it all.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.950
So, you put out your bets
on the thousands tables.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.400
The coins are flipped, in that event,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.670
what's the chance you'll lose all,
all of your money?

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.270
In the single bet case where you put all
of your money on a single table, and

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.280
the outcome is determined by the flip of
a single coin, remember, even though it

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.450
is biased in your favor, there still is
a 49% change it'll come out against you.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.010
So if you put all of your
money on a single table for

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.490
one coin, there's a 49% chance
that you'll lose all of it.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.420
That's pretty high.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.280
I mean consider that in
the context of would you put your

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.280
savings account on
a single bet like that?

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.130
Now, I want you to think a little bit,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.078
consider the multi-bet case where we put
one token on each of the 1,000 tables.

00:00:56.078 --> 00:01:00.610
So there's 1,000 coin flips and
our return is determined by

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.450
the result of all those
individual thousand coin flips.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.610
What is the chance that we
would lose it all in that case?

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.320
Well the answer to that is that it's
the probability that we lose on

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.620
the first table, times the probability
that we lose on the second table,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.760
times the probability
we lose on the third.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.580
And as you can see, we do this for

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.290
all of the thousandth table and multiple
those probabilities altogether, and

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.060
that's the probability we would lose
everything in the multiple bit scenario.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.350
That is a very, very small number.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.160
It's point four nine to
the one thousandth power.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.970
How small is it?

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.268
Let's try and
calculate it on a calculator.

00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:47.310
So it's 0.49 raised
to the 1,000th power.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.720
Let's see how small that is.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.220
It's so small it's not even a number.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.910
That's how small it is.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.090
Okay, let's look at another
way to evaluate risk.
