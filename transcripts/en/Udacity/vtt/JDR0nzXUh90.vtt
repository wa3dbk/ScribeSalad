00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.770
Let's start with objects. An object is a

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.330
computing unit organized around a collection of state

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.350
or instance variables that define the state of

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.390
the object. In addition, each object has associated

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.150
with it a set operations or methods that

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.850
operate on such state. So what that means

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.420
is that operations and methods read and write

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.210
instance variables. And in traditional object orientation, we say

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.240
that operations are invoked by sending a message

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.520
to the appropriate object, which is what we call

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.660
normally a method implication. So now that we define

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.590
what an object is, state variables, or attributes, and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.440
operations or methods, let's see what a class is.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.900
A class is basically a template. A blueprint, if

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.700
you wish, from which new objects, which is what

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.655
we call instances of the class can be created.

00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:52.800
And notice that the fact of having a blueprint for

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.610
objects that allows us to create as many objects as

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.390
we want can further reuse, and also contribute to make

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.300
the code more readable, understandable,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270
and therefore ultimately more maintainable.
