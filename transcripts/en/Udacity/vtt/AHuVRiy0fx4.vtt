00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.590
Now, we know how easy it is to transform a function in a lot of different ways.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.125
We can make a graph move to the left, we can make it move to the right. We can

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:17.962
make it move up, and we can make it move down, too. We can even flip it upside

00:00:17.962 --> 00:00:22.758
down, amazing. Now, we know that this kind of flipping is called a reflection

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:26.180
in the x-axis since the x-axis is the line that we're flipping the graph

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.185
across. However, we have this other axis, too, the y-axis. What do you think a

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:37.036
reflection in the y-axis would look like? And how do we make that happen in our

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:41.875
equation for a function? The function that we were just looking at and that I

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.843
was just transforming is this black one right here, f of x equals the square

00:00:45.843 --> 00:00:51.004
root of x. Now, graphs A and B here are graphs of different functions,

00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:55.980
functions that are different transformations of this original function. Which

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.435
one represents this function reflected in the x-axis? And which one, for

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:04.952
instance this function, reflected in the y-axis? Please fill in A or B in each

00:01:04.952 --> 00:01:06.359
of these boxes.
