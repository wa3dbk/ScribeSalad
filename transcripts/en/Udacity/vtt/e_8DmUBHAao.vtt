00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.850
We've seen this kind of code before. All we're doing is we're

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.670
using qplot to plot the price of diamond against its carat weight. And

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.530
we're going to trim the top percentile off of both carat and price. If

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.740
you use the full ggplot syntax, your code will look something like this.
