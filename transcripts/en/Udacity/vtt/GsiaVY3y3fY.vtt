00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.360
Some tools are built into the device,
as you saw, but

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.480
others work by monitoring your
device during normal use,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.270
these are generally available
through Android Studio.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.190
For example, consider Memory Monitor.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.850
Memory Monitor works by tracking how
much memory is currently allocated, and

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.410
can be a great way to see how specific
actions or events can affect your heap.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.500
Here we have Sunshine, and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.900
you can see how several events
claimed additional memory.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.080
These were clicks from the list view
to the detail view and back, and

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.710
required memory for
the detail fragments.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.970
And here was a change in the location
setting, which sparked a new sync for

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.610
new weather data.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.270
You can also see when garbage
collection events occur,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.630
as the free space increases
when this memory is reclaimed.
