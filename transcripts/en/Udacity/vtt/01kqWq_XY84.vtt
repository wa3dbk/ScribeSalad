00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.989
Personality traits are dispositions to behave in a particular over time. So,

00:00:04.989 --> 00:00:10.888
traits are connected directly to the disposition to behave. Let's look in an

00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:18.690
example. Here we see Miriam and Biriam. Miriam is usually very friendly. Watch.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.087
See, someone cut her in the lunch line and she was nice about it. She holds the

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:25.831
door for people when they're walking in. Someone even hits her car when they

00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:30.697
weren't paying attention. She was less nice to the person in this situation,

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:36.344
but tried to be understanding. Someone gave her a million dollars and she was

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:41.410
extra nice to them. Now let's go to Biriam, who's usually not very friendly.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.254
Somebody cut him in line and he rudely makes them know how wrong they were to

00:00:45.254 --> 00:00:50.621
cut him. Someone's walking up and he doesn't hold the door for them. Someone

00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:54.013
hits his car when they weren't paying attention and he's really, really rude

00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:59.351
about it. Someone gives him a million dollars and then we see him be kind of

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.989
nice to that person.
