00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.910
As we mentioned before,

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:09.220
we are now going to form a kernel density estimate from our model for x.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.450
This will formalize the concept of the histogram as a non-parametric model.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.765
And in the next few videos we are going to see how to do this.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:24.788
Non-parametric models are extremely useful to get from discrete data,

00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:29.220
to probability to density functions or distributions.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.780
For example, it is useful in signal processing,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.970
in online data collection to build quick models, and in several other fields.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.100
In our case, we are going to use a single variable x.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.540
If x one, x two to xn are data points.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.880
We're after a probability density function P of x.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.898
That best describes the distribution from which x one,

00:00:56.898 --> 00:01:01.640
x two, so on till x n could have been drawn from.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.370
How do we go about doing this?
