00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.649
The Java back-end part of the app is independent

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:05.120
of the front-end or the UI. In this case,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.180
the back-end defines endpoint functions and the UI calls

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.760
those functions. So we're going to start our explanation of the

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.280
code by looking at the definition of the endpoint

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.017
functions. So I've opened up HelloWorldEndpoints. It's in, this is

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:21.491
the package and then we've imported the classes that

00:00:21.491 --> 00:00:26.090
we need from the spi.config package. SPI basically means endpoint.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.110
So here are the imports that we need to use endpoints. Now here at the top

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.223
of the file, it says @Api [UNKNOWN] and

00:00:32.223 --> 00:00:36.190
its name equals helloworldendpoints, version equals v1. This

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.890
is where we're saying, hey, this file contains

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.390
endpoint functions. The description's pretty obvious and then

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.280
the client IDs specify which clients are allowed

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.540
to use these endpoint functions. Here we specified Constants.WEB_CLIENT_ID,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.480
but actually for now, we don't really care which client uses us. But this one

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.960
is important, the API_Explorer. So we've specified

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.310
that the API_EXPLORER_CLIENT_ID is allowed to use our

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.560
endpoint functions. And if we look at Constants.java, see here,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.842
the WEB_CLIENT_ID, we didn't really set it. But here we did set the

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:20.784
API_EXPLORER_CLIENT_ID. You get this from Constant.API_EXPLORER_CLIENT_ID. And

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:27.700
we get this from the SPI.Constant package. So if you want

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.710
API Explorer to be able to access your back-end functions, you do need to enable

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.770
the client ID to use API Explorer. Okay, so back here in HelloWorldEndpoints,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.920
we've defined just a couple different endpoints.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.950
They're very, very simple. The first method

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.680
is sayHello and we've declared it as an @ApiMethod or an @ApiMethod.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.488
By default, every method inside a file that's been declared

00:01:56.488 --> 00:02:01.366
as an @Api is exposed through endpoints. But you can set

00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:02.768
the name if you want and the path.

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:06.092
And then the method. So here the sayHello method

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:09.292
simply returns a new instance of the HelloClass

00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:11.860
object. We'll look at that in just a second.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.370
And then the next method, sayHelloByName takes an argument,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.250
name, and we've declared it must be named, the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.540
argument must be named name, and we return a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.260
new instance of the HelloClass created with the name

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.200
string. That's all these methods do. Basically, they say

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.710
hello and they say hello by name. So both

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.450
of these methods return an instance of HelloClass. So

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.860
let's quickly take a look at HelloClass. And you

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.630
see this is a really simple class. Doesn't

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.710
import anything. It's just a POJO, plain old Java

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.460
object. It has one field message. Has a

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.680
default constructor. And it has a constructor that takes

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.530
the name and generates a message based on

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.530
the name and sets a message. And that's all

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.570
it does. Now the reason we need this

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.880
class is because endpoint functions can't return string objects.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.140
They have to return objects with fields. Otherwise, we

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.520
could probably just define our endpoint functions to return

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.030
a string of the message. But since we need

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.680
a real object, we're using HelloClass for it. Okay, now

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.500
I'm going to run my app. I'm going to run it

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.740
on the dev server, on localhost. So this time since

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.440
I've already got the configuration, the run configuration setup,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.580
I just go to Run As, and then I choose

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.543
Maven build. And I choose the configuration that

00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:33.354
I set up earlier and then I choose

00:03:33.354 --> 00:03:37.660
OK. Now it going to run it on localhost.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.520
Again, you can go to localhost and see your

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.510
app. See the homepage for your app. But

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.160
actually, I don't want to do that right now.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.609
I want to go straight to the API Explorer. To get there, you just

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.409
add a /_ah/api/explorer.

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:03.648
It's localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer.

00:04:03.648 --> 00:04:08.130
So you see this when you go to the API explorer. You

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.460
can click on Services to show the services, and then you can click on

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.649
the available API to drill down to see what functions are available.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.110
And we have sayHello and we have sayHelloByName.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.510
And if you recall, these are the two functions

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.400
that were defined in HelloWorldEndpoints.java. And you can actually

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.370
execute these functions right here in the API Explorer.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.530
So we click sayHello, we say Execute and then

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.620
you scroll down and you'll see the request, which

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.880
shows the requests that got sent. And you see

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.550
the response and you see our response is messages

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.740
Hello World. Kind of what we expected. Now let's

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.450
go up and try the next one, sayHelloByName. Now, see

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.692
here it says name. Remember how we have @name

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:55.221
in our API? Well, this is going to show the name

00:04:55.221 --> 00:04:58.184
here, a bit confusing because we have @name and

00:04:58.184 --> 00:05:01.313
name, but this is the name argument right here. So

00:05:01.313 --> 00:05:04.286
let's enter a name and then we'll execute it.

00:05:04.286 --> 00:05:06.985
And again, here is the request, but here is the

00:05:06.985 --> 00:05:12.510
response. Hello Lauren. It took the name that we supplied. Okay.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.300
Cool. So now you know how to use the APIs Explorer.
