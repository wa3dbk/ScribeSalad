00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.484
Well, this distance would be 12 units, great thinking if you found it. Since to

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:09.860
find this vertical distance, we figured out how far we climbed on the y axis.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.171
We went from y equals 3, up 5 units to y equals 8. That's how we knew that this

00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:21.162
distance was 5. So to find the horizontal distance. We're going to start at x

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:25.750
equals negative 7, this x value, and run all the way to the right, to x equals

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.409
positive 5, this x value. So, the horizontal distance between these two points

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:37.989
would be from negative 7 to positive 5. That would be a total distance of 12

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.706
units. You can find this distance by counting the spaces from negative 7 to

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:46.264
positive 5. Or you can subtract the 2 numbers, and make sure to take the

00:00:46.264 --> 00:00:51.264
absolute value, so you get a positive number in the end. Here I just did 5

00:00:51.264 --> 00:00:56.684
minus negative 7, which equals positive 12. If you would've subtracted 5 from

00:00:56.684 --> 00:01:01.000
negative 7, you would've gotten negative 12. So you would've had to take the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.973
absolute value. So that way you get a positive distance, or just 12.
