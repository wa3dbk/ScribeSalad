00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.600
The last plot that we'll make for this course is called

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.330
a Heat Map. For our data set we want to display

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.790
each combination of gene and sample case, the difference in gene

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.290
expression and the sample from the base line. We want to display combinations

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.550
where a gene is over expressed in red. in combinations where

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.620
it is under expressed in blue. Here's the code to make that

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.610
Heat Map. First, we'll run all of this in order to

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.500
melt our data to a long format. And then we just run

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.090
our ggplot code using the geom, geom tile. Now,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.530
this last line is going to give us a scale gradient.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.710
And we're going to use the colors from blue to red.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.450
So, let's see what the output looks like. And, there's

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.160
our Heat Map. Even with such a dense display, we

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.650
aren't looking at all the data. In particular, we're just

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.468
showing the first 200 genes. That's 200 genes of over

00:00:46.468 --> 00:00:50.350
6,000 of them. And since this data set was produced.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.020
Genomic data sets of these kind, sometimes called

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.140
micro data are only getting larger, and more complex.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.110
What's most interesting, is that other data sets also

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.030
look like this. For example, internet companies run lots

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.040
of randomized experiments. Where in the simplest versions, users

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.820
are randomly assigned to a treatment like a new

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.680
version of a website or some sort of new

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.370
feature or product or a control condition. Then the

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.810
difference in outcome between the treatment and control can

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.770
be computed for a number of metrics of interest.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.990
In many situations, there might have been hundreds or

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.150
thousands of experiments and hundreds of metrics. This data

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.250
looks very similar to the genomic data in some

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.320
ways. And this is why the useful maxim plot

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.700
all the data might not always apply to a

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.840
data set as it did to most of this course.
