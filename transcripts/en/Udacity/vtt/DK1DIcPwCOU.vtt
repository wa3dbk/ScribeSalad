00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.480
So up until now, we've pretty much
assumed that whatever we measured is

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.490
associated to the thing that we're going
to, that we want to keep track of.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.020
But in reality,
there are a couple things happen.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.070
First of all,
there can be multiple objects.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.320
That's what this cute little airplane
thing is supposed to look like.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.700
And in fact radar,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.800
which is where the birthplace of
multi hypothesis tracking came from.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.180
Had this problem, right?

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.070
I get a while bunch of pings back,
there's a bunch of airplanes,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.500
I gotta know which pings go with
which airplanes in order to track,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.000
all the different airplanes.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.698
Or there can be what's known as clutter.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:35.870
Clutter means there's a lot of stuff
in the environment that has nothing

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.390
to do with me.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.320
By the way,
clutter is the basis of camouflage, so

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.870
when you take a look at this rattlesnake
whose contour you can just barely see

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.330
here, there's all this other stuff that
has nothing to do with it being a snake.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.030
So it confuses your visual system.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.590
Fortunately when
the snake starts to move

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.160
if the brush is not moving also then
you can do the association differently.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.090
But in general clutter means that there
are a bunch of measurements that are not

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.940
from the thing I'm really
interested in tracking.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.220
The problem is referred to as
the data association problem and

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.250
the trick is to determine which
measurements go with which tracks and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.980
which measurements should be ignored.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.580
Which measurements cause
you to start a new track.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.070
These are all things that you
have to do when you do tracking.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.120
So there is a simple strategy and that's
what's indicated here I've got a point

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.630
and I've got state now I take some
measurements I might just associate,

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.140
I dunno the closest
measurement to my prediction.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.370
So you remember when we were
tracking the contours for

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.245
the condensation as our Blake algorithm?

00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:41.080
Right?
They took the distance to the nearest

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.950
strong contour as if they new somehow
that that was the right contour.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.100
They just made that assumption.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.120
Unfortunately, that doesn't always work.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.460
That clutter problem.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.300
In fact,
one of the points of clutter is for

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.040
it to confuse something that's
trying to do that association.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.900
So those of you who watch Tom Clancy
movies or read Tom Clancy books,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.850
like I've done, etcetera,
you know that submarines will jettison

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.740
these things that spin around and
make noise and bubbles.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.460
At least I assume they do.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.430
They did in the movies,
they did in the books.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.660
Now the torpedoes have a data
association problem, right?

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.160
Which thing that's making noise or

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.000
making a signal should it
decide is the real state.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.310
Personally I would think seeing some.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.650
You know, many thousand ton

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.970
submarine compared to this
little thing spinning around.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.230
Wouldnt been that hard but
obviously the torpedos arent that smart.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.260
But so it doesnt always work
in the presence of clutter.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.980
There is a most sophisticated
approach to doing this, and

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.980
that is You do what's
called multiple hypothesis.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.010
So multiple hypothesis is, well,
okay, I've seen two things now, and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.920
maybe it's one thing, and
I should associate the real

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.600
object with the left measurement,
and the right one is clutter.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.600
Maybe it's one thing, and I should
associate the object with the right-hand

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.280
one and the left one is clutter.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.800
Or maybe it's two things,
that is a new thing should get created.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.970
Well like I said, there's this
whole area called multi-hypothesis

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.600
tracking where you track
all these different things.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.520
You actually can do this using a,
a particles.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.220
Allright?
You can do particle filtering in

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.270
a not so obvious way, right?

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.180
Each particle Is a hypothesis
about the current state.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.150
So, for example,
a particle can say oh, there are two

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.780
such objects, and here's where they are,
or a particle could say,

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.430
there is one such object, and this
one is not the right one, et cetera.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.140
So you can do that using
particle filtering.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.372
And in fact I one time told Michael
Eishart I, I said Meaning I said,

00:03:45.372 --> 00:03:48.094
you know, for a lot of situations,
I've found that

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:52.440
particle filtering was just a convenient
way of doing multi-hypothesis tracking.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.630
And he said absolutely.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.160
So Michael, if you're out there,
I remember that conversation.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.740
I think he's on the West Coast
having a great time.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.290
So.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.810
So good for him.
