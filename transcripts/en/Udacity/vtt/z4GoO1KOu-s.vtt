00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.600
One of the questions that a cognitive psychologist

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.700
would ask is, can we really multitask? Because that

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.540
has to do with focus and attention and that's

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.580
a cognitive or mental activity. Another question that a

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.230
cognitive psychologist might ask among these is about

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.370
the dog learning to salivate when the door opens

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.930
because what's going on here is the dog is

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.550
learning to associate the door opening with the food.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.710
And that's a learning process, and that's also

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.830
the domain for cognitive psychologists. What's not the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.440
domain for cognitive psychologists is how attachment changes

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.470
over our lives. That's more the question for

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.100
a developmental psychologist because it has to do

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.660
with change over time. Another question that would

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.410
not be one for cognitive psychology would be

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.360
mood and dopamine. That's the brain and how neurotransmitters

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.280
affect our behavior. That would be the question for behavioral neuroscience. The

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.410
shooter, and whether he's having a psychotic episode, and how competent he

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.530
is to stand trial is more for a forensic psychologist. Because that

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.260
has to do with his mental state and the legal question of competence.
