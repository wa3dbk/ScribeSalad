00:00:00.042 --> 00:00:06.357
And the answer is longest, and that's really important. So, let's think about how these threads would run.

00:00:06.357 --> 00:00:09.126
We'll start with all the threads doing useful work.

00:00:09.126 --> 00:00:13.297
They'll all process their first element at the same time, then their second element, and so on.

00:00:13.297 --> 00:00:17.682
But eventually, the threads assigned to short rows will run out of work to do,

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:20.817
so they'll be idle while the longer rows continue to do work.

00:00:20.817 --> 00:00:24.527
This code is really efficient if all the rows have the same length.

00:00:24.527 --> 00:00:29.052
But it's a lot less efficient if the lengths of the rows differ, because then the threads

00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:33.372
with shorter rows are idle, while threads with longer rows are still working.
