00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So to answer this, we need to create a list,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and to create a list, we use the square bracket

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and put the elements that we want in the list

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
between the brackets, separated by commas.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In this case, we have the elements the string Moe,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the string Larry, and the string Curly.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
To store that in a variable, we need an assignment statement.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now I know some of you are worried that

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in some of the Three Stooges movies, Shemp replaced Curly,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and we'll see that we can actually do that with lists,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but we'll get to that a little bit later.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Let's try this in the Python interpreter.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And we can click "Run" to see the value of stooges as we've defined it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It is a list containing those 3 strings.
