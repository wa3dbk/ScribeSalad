00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.114
And the answer is log n. How cool is that?

00:00:03.114 --> 00:00:09.715
We're now doing more work in operations on each of the log n steps. So O of n log n overall.

00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:14.925
But we'll finish in log n steps instead of n steps, and I find this pretty amazing.

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:17.328
What a beautiful algorithm.
