00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:03.679
Way back in Unit 1, when we talked about step in work complexity, we said that

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:07.436
we would love to find algorithms that have the same work complexity as the serial

00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:10.023
algorithm but have a smaller step complexity.

00:00:10.023 --> 00:00:12.657
Reduce would be a good example here, or scan.

00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:15.839
But if we said we can't do that, sometimes we would be willing

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.177
to accept more work if it gets us fewer steps.

00:00:19.177 --> 00:00:21.631
And that's what we are going to do here. But how?

00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.342
This is not intuitive, or more at least it isn't for most people,

00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:26.957
and it certainly wasn't for me when I learned this material.

00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:31.532
Hills and Steele first expressed skepticism they could improve on quadratic work,

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:36.051
but then concluded--and I am quoting from their paper--essentially we overlooked

00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:39.424
the power of having many processors working on the problem at once.

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:42.000
So at a high level, here's what we are going to do.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.205
On every node, we start by knowing the node that's 1 hop away. That's the next pointer, in blue.

00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:54.018
So on the next iteration, we can visit our next pointer's next pointer, and get 2 hops away.

00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:57.488
And then, on the next iteration, we can get to 3 hops away, and so on.

00:00:57.488 --> 00:01:00.130
So that's what I am showing here when I say straight forward approach.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.152
As we increase the number of iterations, we are also increasing the number of hops away.

00:01:05.152 --> 00:01:07.313
But that's the wrong way to think about it.

00:01:07.313 --> 00:01:12.535
If we just did it that way, we'd be repeating a lot of work that the nodes down the chain are doing,

00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:15.723
and we would have quadratic complexity work.

00:01:15.723 --> 00:01:22.946
Instead, after the first iteration, we have each node knowing the node that is 2 hops away.

00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:28.376
So let's say we're interested in this node and we know that we are pointing to node x here.

00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:32.202
Well normally what we'd do is we'd take the red pointer here,

00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:36.598
and then change our red pointer to be red pointer plus blue pointer.

00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:40.890
So, we'd be moving from knowing the node 2 hops away to the node knowing 3 hops away.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.340
But look, x also knows the node that is 2 hops away.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.739
So, I know the node that's 2 hops away, x knows the node that's 2 hops away.

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:53.980
So, on the second iteration we can leverage the work that x already did

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.060
on it's first iteration to get a pointer that is now 4 hops away.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.487
So we can go red, then red to set our new red pointer here, to be the chum of the chum.

00:02:07.487 --> 00:02:10.401
Now we are going to have a pointer to a node that is 4 hops away,

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:13.363
which also has a pointer to a node that is 4 hops away.

00:02:13.363 --> 00:02:17.367
So the next iteration will have a pointer that is 8 hops away and so on.

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:23.012
So now, instead of going 1, 2, 3, 4, we're now going 1, 2, 4, 8.

00:02:23.012 --> 00:02:27.858
So for N iterations, as a function of N, how many steps is this going to take?
