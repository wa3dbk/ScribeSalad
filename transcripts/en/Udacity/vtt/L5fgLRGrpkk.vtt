00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.260
For the first one we'll get 1 plus 11i, and for the second one we'll get 3 plus

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.600
5i. Great effort if you found those two answers. For the sum we can drop the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.442
parentheses since we're not multiplying anything. Then we just add the real

00:00:13.442 --> 00:00:19.196
numbers together to get 4 minus 3 which equals 1. For the imaginary numbers we

00:00:19.196 --> 00:00:23.672
have 6i and 5i, and that sums to 11i. Don't make the mistake of adding these

00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:28.300
two together to get 12i. Remember this i represents the square root of negative

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.268
1 so these are not like terms. This is a real number and this is an imaginary

00:00:32.268 --> 00:00:36.632
number. When we subtract this complex number we want to distribute this

00:00:36.632 --> 00:00:40.728
negative 1 to each term this means positive 4 becomes negative 4 and negative

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:46.200
2i becomes positive 2i. Now, we're ready to add our real numbers together and

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.845
our imaginary numbers together. We'll have 7 minus 4, which equals 3, and 3i

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:57.700
plus 2i, which equals 5i. This gives us our final result of 3 plus 5i. Well

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.874
done.
