00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
...is investigate in more detail random testing of a specific API,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and that's the bounded queue that we've already looked at a couple times in this class.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So let's take a minute and review the code for the bounded queue.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So what the queue is is an abstract data type. It's providing several methods.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So for example, we have a constructor, an empty call full.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Enqueue adds something, dequeue removes something,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and checkRep is our assertion checker that does sanity checking

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
over the internal state of the queue.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So now let's look at the simple test routine that I wrote.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What it does is it creates a queue of 2 elements, adds some stuff to it,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
asserts that the proper values are returned,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and removes those things from the queue,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
again asserting that the proper things were returned.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And notice also that we're calling checkRep after every queue operation.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So this is a non-random test for the queue.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
What I'd like to do now is, using the Udacity API, write a random tester for the queue.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So let's just talk about this a little bit--how should it work?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's clear that the random test, like the deterministic test here,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
is going to need to start off by creating a queue.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's also clear that after performing any queue operation,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the random test should call checkRep.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The thing that's not clear is how do we decide what API function to call,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and how do we know whether the result is correct?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
One thing you can do is randomly call functions in the queue's API

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
with random arguments and just keep asserting checkRep and not really care what comes out.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That is to say, you can just randomly invoke queue operations in a loop

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and wait for checkRep to fail.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
On the other hand, it's not that hard to do better.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The first thing is we know how many elements the queue holds,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and we also know whether any particular addition

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
or removal from the queue succeeds or fails.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And so it's pretty easy using an integer to keep track of how many elements

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
are currently used in the queue.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And what we'd like to do in that case is assert that any enqueue operation

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to a non-full queue succeeds and any enqueue operation to a full queue fails.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Similarly, any dequeue operation from an empty queue needs to fail,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
as we see a little bit below,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and any dequeue operation from a non-empty queue should succeed.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So the third thing you can do--and you don't need to do this to pass the quiz,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but it's something that would be nice--

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
is actually keep track of what values should be coming out of dequeue operations.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And so let's just take a minute to see what that would look like.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The bounded queue that you're testing is based on a Python array,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
but it turns out that it's really easy to emulate the operation of that queue

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
using native Python data structures.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So basically, if you wanted to do this, what you would do is you would declare a Python list

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that's initially empty, and every time I want to enqueue something in our bounded queue

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
we also append it to the list.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We have to be a little bit more careful than this

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
because if the enqueueing of an item fails, we don't want to append sums to our list.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Similarly, when we dequeue something for the bounded queue,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
if the dequeue operation succeeds, we want to issue l.pop(0).

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The way this works is when something gets appended to a list,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
it gets appended at the end, and l.pop(0) takes something off the beginning.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So basically, we're emulating a queue using native Python data structures,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and our emulated queue isn't going to be as fast as the native queue

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
which is based on the array, but that doesn't matter for testing purposes.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And so if we do these kind of operations and we do them in a random testing loop

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and we insert the appropriate checkReps,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
then we can build really a quite effective random tester for the bounded queue

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
using not that many lines of code.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So what I'd like you to do now is go to the API and write a small random tester for the queue.
