00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.002
So here's what we know so far. We took the equation of our ellipse and we

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:09.542
divided it through by 36. We came up with this equation and we just found that

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:15.250
the x intercepts were (2,0) and negative 2,0. So, we know these two points are

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.547
on our ellipse. So, now that we found the x intercepts, I want you to see if

00:00:19.547 --> 00:00:24.609
you can find the y intercepts. What do you think those two would be?
