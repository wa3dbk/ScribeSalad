00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.582
If we now try to summarize what we have so far, we have a pile class and its got

00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:10.790
operations. We can put a tree onto the pile. We can get a tree from the pile.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.450
We can take a tree off of the pile. For the counter we have increment and

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.210
display. And for the tree class we have split and throw away.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.170
Now, a minute ago we talked about throwing away from the pile,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.652
and sometimes these things can go back and forth. For the moment we are going to

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:33.120
associate with the tree class. In our class model diagram we added a new

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.710
compartment at the bottom of the rectangle to hold the operations. In general,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.480
we could also at this time list of

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.690
various arguments that go arguments to the operations, what their types are,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.070
what is the type of the return value, or we could hold off that process later.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.860
What we are trying to do is get a feel for what the elements of the problem are,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.910
and how, how, how they are represented in terms of attributes, and then

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.520
what services the various the various classes can have in terms of operations.
