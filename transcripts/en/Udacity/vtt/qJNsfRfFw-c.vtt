00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.240
So here, I've been using just numbers as

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.500
the values, but the values can actually be anything

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.340
we want. They can even be other dictionaries. So

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.510
if you wanted to make more interesting version of

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.720
elements. So we'll start with an empty dictionary, and we

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.070
can add a new element. This time we'll use the atomic symbol as

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.690
the key, and we'll make the value of the element a dictionary that

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.170
provides some information about it. So we've added an

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.420
element to our dictionary. The key is the single

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.950
letter H, and it has as its value a

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.320
dictionary, that has three entries with the key name

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.970
number and weight. And values associated with each of

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.770
those that could be different types. Name is a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.390
string, which gives the full name of the element.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.740
We'll add another element to our dictionary, and so for

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.490
helium, we have the same name, number and weight keys,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.710
and, so for helium we have an extra entry that

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.840
says it's a noble gas, and the value of noble

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.800
gas is true. So now we can look up the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.260
element H, we'll see it's entry. Again note that it's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.880
a dictionary, so the order is not the same as

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.320
the order that we used here. But we can do

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.936
another lookup. So now we're looking up element H, that gets

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:19.200
us the dictionary here. And then we're looking up in that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.000
dictionary the value name, and that will give us the name

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.080
of the element, whose symbol is H. We can change this

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.360
to look up some other property. Let's look at the weight.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.850
And we can change element to look up the

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.530
value for helium instead of for hydrogen. And now

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.210
we get the 4.002, which was the weight of

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.560
helium. If we look up the noble gas property,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.400
we get true for helium. What's going to happen if we look it up for hydrogen?

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.000
So here we get an error, and we get the same

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.280
error that we got before when we tried to look lithium

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.440
up in the elements that didn't include lithium as a key.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.630
We are looking for the key noble gas, but it doesn't exist.
