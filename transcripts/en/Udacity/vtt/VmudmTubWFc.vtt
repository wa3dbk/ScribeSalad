We're so close to having x by itself. If I want the left side of the equation to

00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:08.753
now read x plus b over two a, what does the right side need to be? I'll make the

00:00:08.753 --> 00:00:12.919
version of the equation we just had a little bit bigger. Read each of these

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.447
answer choices really carefully to figure out whether or not it's correct. Note

00:00:17.447 --> 00:00:21.807
that I've put square boxes next to each of these. Indicating that you can check

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:25.274
as many of these as you think are right. There might be multiple ways to write

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:26.731
what belongs on the right side.
