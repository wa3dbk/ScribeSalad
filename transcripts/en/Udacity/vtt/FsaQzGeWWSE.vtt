00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.913
So far, I've only kind of looked at grey-scale images.

00:00:03.913 --> 00:00:06.328
Let's step back and now actually go back to color images.

00:00:06.328 --> 00:00:09.013
So, this is the original color image, the mandrill image,

00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:10.391
that we've looked at before.

00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:12.712
What we want to do now is start thinking about is,

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.960
what makes this a color image?

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.750
Well, basically, what we need to now start thinking about is,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.741
what is a red channel?

00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:20.388
What is a green channel and a blue channel?

00:00:20.388 --> 00:00:22.279
In essence, I'm going to claim this,

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.590
this image is actually divided into, three different color channels.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.430
So now I'm going to slowly and

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.870
slowly show you the three different channels, starting with the blue channel.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.570
Of course, each color image is of three channels with their own intensities.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.950
This is the blue channel.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.600
If you notice here the regions in this image which has a lot more blue, is,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.770
of course, more white because that's where the maximum intensity is.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.240
In the green case, if you notice, these parts have a lot more white colors.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.610
And in the case of red channel, this part, of course, is the brightest.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.090
So, in essence, these are the three different channels, and

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.700
these merge together.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.940
Blended together create our color image.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.160
So this now makes us want to add one aspect

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.260
addition to the resolution of the image.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.430
That is we have a width, we have a height and

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.800
of course we have number of channels.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:20.023
So in essence if this was a 512 by 512 image, we would also have three channels.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.800
And therefore, actually, our resolution would be 512 by 512 times three.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.300
And following from that, each pixel therefore has three intensities.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.350
Each and every pixel in this color image has a red color value,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.490
a green value and a blue value, and composite of this gives us a color image.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.480
I'll recall from last time that each grey scale image is basically represented

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.350
by a, a range of grey values from 0 to 255.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.449
That is also true for each and everyone of the color channels, 0 to 255.

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:57.382
And remembering that basically we said that we needed eight pixel,

00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:58.970
eight bit image.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.980
To be able to get a range from zero to 255, because that's what we needed.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.720
Well, now, if I wanted to have three of them,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.288
basically you can imagine the range is going to be 24 bits to

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.240
be able to get a much bigger range than we have right now.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.120
And that's what basically we mean by an eight-bit grayscale image or

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.880
a 24-bit color image.
