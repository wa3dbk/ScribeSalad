00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So the first main topic we'll introduce is symmetric cryptosystems.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Symmetric means both encryption and decryption are done with the same key.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I want to introduce some terminology that we'll use throughout the course.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So we can think of encryption as a function,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and it takes as input a plain text--this is the unencrypted message--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
it outputs a ciphertext, and then our goal is to be able

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to send that ciphertext over an insecure channel.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This could be a wireless network, this could be the internet,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
this could be a courier carrying your message,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
any channel where we can't trust the channel to be secure.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We hope what comes out of the channel is the same ciphertext we put into it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Then that goes into a decryption function, and what comes out

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is the message that we sent it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Our cast of characters--we often talk about Alice sending the message,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Bob receiving it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We also have malicious characters who might be listening in on this channel.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
One of those is called Eve--for eavesdropper--and she has really big ears

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and can hear the messages sent between Alice and Bob,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but she only hears what's sent over the insecure channel,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
she doesn't have access to the plain text--that's the input to the encryption function--

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
or the plain text that comes out of the decryption function at the other end.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But she can hear the ciphertext that's sent over the insecure channel.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
To think about this a little more precisely,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the plain text is some message, and it's selected from a set of messages.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So, M is the set of all possible messages,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and M could be finite--for a given length, M is finite--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and we'll often be thinking about fixed-length messages,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
so there's a finite set of them, and M is some message selected from that set.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The ciphertext is C--selected from the set of all possible ciphertexts,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and the encryption and decryption functions are functions.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The encryption function--as shown here--

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
is a function that goes from an element of M to an element of C.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The decryption function goes from an element of C--a ciphertext--to an element of M.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
In order for Bob to receive the same message as the one Alice encrypted,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
we need this property--that the D function is an inverse of the M function.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So we need it to be the case for all messages.

00:02:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The result of decryption the encryption of that message is the same as the message we started with.
