The bulk of canvas interaction that GRITS uses, is through rendering images to

00:00:04.586 --> 00:00:08.953
the canvas. In order to draw an image to the canvas, we first have to load it.

00:00:09.054 --> 00:00:13.204
In order to load an image, we need to create a new image object, which in

00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:17.661
Javascript, is comprised of three steps. Number 1, is we need to declare the

00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:22.905
image object. Number 2, is we need to define its onload function. Then number 3

00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:27.270
we need to set the image.source attribute. It's worth noting that as soon as the

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:31.635
source property if this image is set through a value Javascript will kick off

00:00:31.647 --> 00:00:35.975
onload function. Because of this, we need to specify the callback function first

00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:40.326
before setting the source attribute. Otherwise the image will load the data and

00:00:40.338 --> 00:00:42.463
we won't get a callback received.

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.033
Now let's take a look at this code. Here is the url of the image that we'd like

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:50.707
you to load. What we want you to do is create a new image object, following the

00:00:50.707 --> 00:00:54.508
steps we just mentioned, and set the onload function and source properties for

00:00:54.508 --> 00:00:58.069
that image described in the code. Make sure that your onload function is

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.693
assigned to this onImageLoad down here, which will actually print out some nice

00:01:01.693 --> 00:01:04.766
little message to the console log, letting you know that things have loaded

00:01:04.778 --> 00:01:08.309
properly. If you're confused about whether or not your image is loading, don't

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:12.767
forget to check out Chrome's developer tools on the network tab, which will list

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:15.988
whether or not the image has been loaded, and how long it took to do it.
