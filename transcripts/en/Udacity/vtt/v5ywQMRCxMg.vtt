00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.940
Before you tackle the next mini project,

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.850
I want you to hear from Scott Murray again.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.450
Scott has some excellent advice for breaking into the field.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.670
If you could go back and sort of give yourself advice for

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.360
when you first started in the field.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.920
When you first started making individualizations, what advice would that be?

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.260
&gt;&gt; My advice would be.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.420
To just find topics I'm really excited about and go pursue them,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.140
which I sort of did.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.120
But secondly, to get that stuff published and

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.560
out on the web and start sharing it, like, sooner.

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:36.762
I know with sort of my personal experience there's this feeling.

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:40.850
Like, I can't put something out into the world until it's, like, polished and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.296
finished and perfect and really exciting or amazing.

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:45.980
I know students get that a lot, too.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.180
It can be really intimidating.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.429
Especially if you're studying works by people who are doing you know,

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.605
at least on paper having all kinds of a success.

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:54.570
And like, doing all these amazing projects.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.890
It can be really intimidating to be like, oh, here's this little chart I made.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.756
Or here's this you know, thing that's so, feels so

00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:03.060
insignificant or it might have problems.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.780
But I think really that's how you get established in this,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.710
probably in a lot of fields.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.260
But especially in this field where it's all about sharing and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.350
this visual communication.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.680
And then, having people respond to that graphic.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.210
because the graphics are not just kind of endpoints, or

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.940
the visualizations aren't just endpoints.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.420
But they're really sort of you know starting points for

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.568
the rest of the conversation.

00:01:27.568 --> 00:01:29.816
So one thing this is especially true I guess for

00:01:29.816 --> 00:01:31.714
design students as in you have to do it now.

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:33.990
You know, you have to have a web based portfolio.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.500
You have to have something on the web where you can publish things and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.360
get it out there.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.987
And like engage people and get a response.

00:01:40.987 --> 00:01:45.103
So I would say you know, start making stuff as quick as you can and

00:01:45.103 --> 00:01:48.640
start putting it out there as quick as you can.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.409
And certainly engaging with other practitioners and

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.262
you know, critiquing in a helpful way.

00:01:55.262 --> 00:01:59.743
So trying to provide helpful advice and

00:01:59.743 --> 00:02:04.650
not just It's kind of too easy to cut down the things that aren't very good.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.570
like, there's been some discussion, kind of in the community,

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.199
about this recently.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.210
On what's the value of critique?

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.600
And what kind of critique is helpful?

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.270
Somebody uses you know, quote, unquote, bad colors it's very easy to be like,

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.300
oh, well those are you know, horrible colors.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.330
It makes it too hard to read, or something.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.600
Instead of saying, those are horrible colors.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.590
Say you know, maybe this is somebody new who's coming in.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.560
And they're trying to learn how to do a good job.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.750
Encourage them with hey, why don't, can I suggest these better colors?

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.860
Or, can I suggest this other visual representation.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.360
So I think part of it is, you know, getting your stuff out there.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.450
But it's also being friendly and supportive and you know, hopefully kind and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.410
empathizing with the people who are new, who are just coming in.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.450
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.950
Great.
