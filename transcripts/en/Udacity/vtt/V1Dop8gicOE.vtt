00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.420
Congratulations.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.310
You should be extremely proud
of the work you've accomplished.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.170
Can you believe that a short time ago
Angular was this other worldly entity?

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.290
Now not only have you worked through
a lot of Angular's complicated concepts

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.740
like scopes and services.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.710
But you've built several
applications in Angular.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.530
We've been discovering
what Angular offers and

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.920
how it works I encourage you
not to stop here though.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.410
There's so much more to angular that
makes it a fantastic framework.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.560
Go on and learn about the differences
between services and factories.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.590
The application bootstrap cycle.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.740
The details of two way data binding by
looking at how Angular Digest works.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.760
And creating your own custom directives.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.500
Let me know what you find.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.720
What are you still doing here?

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.320
Go build something amazing.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.540
In the next lesson we'll
be taking a look at Ember,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.630
a framework that helps you build
ambitious web applications.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.440
Come back and check it out.
