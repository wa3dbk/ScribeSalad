When working with sets, we don't always have to work with numbers. We can also

00:00:04.085 --> 00:00:08.221
have letters. So here I have set m, and it contains the letters of math. And set

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:12.262
y which contains the letters of udacity. For this quiz, I want you to find the

00:00:12.274 --> 00:00:16.296
intersection of m and y, and the union of m and y. You want to put your answers

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:20.458
here. You'll need to remember what each symbol means. I've drawn a venn diagram

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.018
to help you out. This is always a great way to get started. Good luck.
