One of our factors will be x minus the quantity 3 plus 2i and the other will be

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:09.274
x minus the quantity 3 minus 2i. We can, of course, distribute the subtraction

00:00:09.274 --> 00:00:14.312
if we want to. If we do that, then we'll end up with x minus 3 minus 2i and x

00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:18.523
minus 3 plus 2i. Either way of writing them works.
