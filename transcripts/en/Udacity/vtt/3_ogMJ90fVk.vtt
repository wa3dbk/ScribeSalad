00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So to prepare for watching these lectures, of course, you'll be just to hit the play button

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but actually it would be helpful, if you actually do some reading.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And as I said earlier, there's optional reading and you'll see this going forward

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
after each lecture and a Starup Owner's Manual pp. 1-50 or in the strategy volume if it's an E-book.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And in Business Model Generation pp 14-49, completely optional.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But what's available for free is if you want to get a feel of the core strategy

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
how we're trying to teach this and how we teach this in real life,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
you could go to steveblank.com category/Lean LaunchPad or just click on the link.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You could also look at other student's presentations and we have our students

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
make 2-min quick time videos which are summaries of their presentations as well

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and you could see those at steveblank.com/slides but if you want to actively engage in the class,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
your first real homework is download that Osterwalder canvas and using yellow stickies,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
take a shot at actually filling out all your hypothesis on the business model canvass.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's okay if you're just guessing because the whole class is about

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
how do you turn those guesses into facts.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So get ready, download the canvas, put on those yellow stickies, and then looking at those boxes,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
start figuring out who would you call on and who would you contact to start testing those hypothesis

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and take a look for the first week at your value proposition and customer segment box.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Who would you want to talk to, to validate whether your idea about what features are important

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and who would you talk to, to validate that these are customers you want to go after

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and we're just getting you ready for the work you're going to do after the next lecture.

00:01:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
See you soon!
