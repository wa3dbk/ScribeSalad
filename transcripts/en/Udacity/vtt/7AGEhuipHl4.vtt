00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.490
We can't prove that the null hypothesis is true. We can only obtain evidence to

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.718
reject the null hypothesis. Let's take a simple example. Let's say, our null

00:00:10.718 --> 00:00:16.810
hypothesis is that most dogs have four legs. And we define most as more than

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.356
50% of dogs. This 50% is analogous to our alpha level where we set our

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:26.820
criterion for making a decision. Our alternative hypothesis is that most dogs

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.115
have less than four legs. Note that this is like a one tailed test. Where we're

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:36.870
not guessing that most dogs have a different amount than four legs. We're

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.255
guessing most dogs have less, so there's a direction. Now let's say we sample

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:46.301
10 dogs and find that all of them have four legs. Did we prove that the null

00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:49.723
hypothesis is true, that most dogs have four legs?
