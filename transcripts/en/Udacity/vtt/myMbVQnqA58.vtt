00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.600
What ordering did you
come up with David?

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.850
&gt;&gt; So what we see is that each goal
actually clobbers the next goal

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.730
in its last step.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.860
So the post condition of move A,
B is that A is now on B.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.219
But a precondition for
move B, C is that B is clear.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.830
Because A is on B, B is no longer clear,
so we can't move B to C, so

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.050
this plan has clobbered this plan.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.490
Similarly, if we move B to C,
we no longer can move C on top of D

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.810
because C is no longer clear, so
this plan has clobbered this plan.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.560
So we're going to need to do this plan
first, then this plan, then this plan.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.060
&gt;&gt; Good, David.
