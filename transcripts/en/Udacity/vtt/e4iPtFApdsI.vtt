00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.840
Remember that merging creates a new commit, so we'll have to add a node here.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.510
Merge commits have multiple parents.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.200
And in this case, those parents will be the current tip of the master branch and

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.990
the current tip of the easy branch.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.870
We're trying to update easy mode, so

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.020
we'll want to move the label to the new commit.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.560
Next, Caroline will walk through the process of actually creating the merge node

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.330
on the command line.
