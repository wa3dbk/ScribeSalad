00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.070
So why is what we've covered so
far, important?

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.130
Because these are some of the reasons
that the US spends far more per capita.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.750
Typically twice as much on healthcare,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.830
than other advanced
industrialized nations.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.190
That's certainly true if you
again compare the US to France.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.380
Moreover, while increases in US
healthcare spending have slowed in

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.520
recent years, for reasons that aren't
yet clear, historically our healthcare

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.210
cost have grown much faster than
those in the same group of nations.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.220
The inexorable growth of chronic
disease, is one of the key reasons why.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.376
That spending might be okay if
we were getting a great result.

00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:50.512
But again, comparing the US here,
to this group of

00:00:50.512 --> 00:00:55.530
industrialized countries and
even some others,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.199
we rank 26th in life
expectancy shown here.

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.358
We're also a clear outlier,
spending far more, but

00:01:04.358 --> 00:01:11.120
dying younger than the citizens of these
other countries that spend far less.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.860
Clearly a serious problem, but

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.720
you may be asking, what does it
have to do with health informatics?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.260
We turn to that now.
