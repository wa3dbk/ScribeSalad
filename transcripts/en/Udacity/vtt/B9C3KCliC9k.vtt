00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.061
A final consequence of Handel's law that we will

00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:06.675
discuss, is the law of diminishing returns. Let's say

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:09.750
that we had an original processor, which we will

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.900
call GEN1 in which our execution time can roughly

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.375
be divided into a purple phase and a blue

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.450
phase each of them takes about half the execution

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.388
time. Let's say that in the generation 2 processor

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:25.504
we decided to speed up the blue phase by factor

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:31.810
of two. What we got now is that the purple part is not affected and the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.120
blue part is now half as long. The orbital speed up of the GEN2 processor over

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.410
GEN1 is equal to one over half is not enhanced. Half is speed up by a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.160
factor of two and we get the the speed-up of 133, which is a sizeable speed-up.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.086
Now let's say that we have a generation three

00:00:55.086 --> 00:00:58.551
processor, where we again get the blue part and speed

00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:00.861
it up by a factor of two, relative to

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.751
the GEN2 processors. Now we have that the purple part

00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:10.075
is still the same, and the blue part is half of what it was. The speed up of the

00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:13.551
GEN3 processor over a GEN2 processor is 1 over and

00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:17.224
now we have to be careful. The unaffected part is

00:01:17.224 --> 00:01:20.547
now 2 3rds of the execution time. The

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:23.470
affected part is only one third and that part

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.845
is still affected by a factor of 2, so the overall speed up is 1.2 over GEN2.

00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:31.373
If we keep improving the blue part over

00:01:31.373 --> 00:01:34.928
the generations, eventually we will get to almost no

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:39.480
speed up. Why? Because we are improving what

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.370
amounts to less and less of the execution time.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.494
Furthermore, usually it is the case that improving

00:01:45.494 --> 00:01:48.618
something initially is not very hard, but after you

00:01:48.618 --> 00:01:52.310
exhaust the easy methods for improvement, it becomes very,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.582
very difficult to get new speed ups on a

00:01:54.582 --> 00:01:58.776
thing that has been already enhanced hugely. So eventually,

00:01:58.776 --> 00:02:01.812
the solutions that will improve the purple part will

00:02:01.812 --> 00:02:04.986
be cheaper than the solutions that further improve the

00:02:04.986 --> 00:02:07.470
blue part just because all of the easy stuff

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.889
on improving the blue part we have already done.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.659
So not only do we get lower speed ups

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.648
by improving the blue part, it's actually becoming more

00:02:15.648 --> 00:02:18.764
difficult to do so. This is sort of a

00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:22.742
lesson to computer architects to not go overboard improving

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:26.252
the same thing, because the things they have already

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:29.372
improved are now a smaller percentage of the new

00:02:29.372 --> 00:02:32.492
execution time, and we need to reassess what is

00:02:32.492 --> 00:02:37.280
now the dominant part in the execution time. In other words, once you

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.140
have applied one improvement, you need to reconsider what is now the new

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.740
dominant part in the execution time.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.621
And definitely, when applying Handel's law, we

00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:52.320
need to consider what is now the fraction enhanced, and the fraction unenhanced.
