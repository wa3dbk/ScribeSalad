00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.890
The correct answer is B and C.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.373
There's definitely an increasing
interest in consumers assuming more

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:07.741
active roles in their care,

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.318
as we've discussed a number
of times in this course.

00:00:10.318 --> 00:00:14.639
And we're all familiar with
the rapid growth of smartphones,

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.285
sensors, and other far less expensive,
and relatively mobile and

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:22.250
hopefully more user-friendly devices.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.250
So given all of that,
A is clearly wrong, if anything,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.830
patients are more capable of sending
data to their physicians today

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.820
than they were in the past.
