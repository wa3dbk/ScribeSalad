00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.180
Once your launch page is ready to go,
you'll have a few options for

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.210
where to list your app.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.880
Like the Google play store, the IOS app
store or even the Chrome web store.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.472
You can develop your app to be
compatible with all the different app

00:00:11.472 --> 00:00:14.080
stores out there, but
before you work too hard,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.990
you may want to start with focusing
on the best app store for your needs.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.450
Now think about your audience and
what they're more likely to use.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.990
Read the market share research
to validate your assumption.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.400
Now if you focus on a specific region,
you can easily find out which operating

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.460
system dominates that market, and
you can develop your app accordingly.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.070
Our example here will be how to
launch on the Android Play Store

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.180
since Android dominates
the global market.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.770
Each stores has its own methods and
requirements to launching.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.050
These things change over time,
so the best thing for

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.620
you to do is check out
their documentation.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.910
We've linked to various stores
in the instructor notes.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.310
In the long term, you don't don't need
to choose one app store over another,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.350
if you have an app that fits
many different platforms.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.930
That way you can reach more customers.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.880
But focusing on one first
can help you validate and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.640
perfect your idea before
expanding to another platform.
