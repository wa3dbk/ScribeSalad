00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.620
Now we will argue that
the simplex algorithm is correct,

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.400
giving us a basic feasible solution for
bounded linear programs, and

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.580
reporting that unbounded
ones are unbounded.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.900
Let's consider the bounded case first.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.370
First we recognize that at each
step we make some progress,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.850
usually improving the objective value.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.410
We have to be careful here in the case
of degenerate basic solutions.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.150
Going back to the algorithm, remember
that we picked a new column to go into

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.700
the basis because it had a positive
corresponding value in R D,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.480
and hence increasing it,
increased the objective value.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.390
The trouble is that if the current
basic solution is degenerate,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.330
that is to say that v has a zero entry,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.840
it's possible that we won't get
to move in this direction at all.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.420
The nightmare scenario is that
we end up in some kind of cycle.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.910
There are two ways of
coping with this challenge.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.579
One is to perturb
the constraints slightly.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.569
The other is to give preference to lower
indexed columns for both entering and

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.040
leaving the basis.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.170
This is known as blands rule.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.280
In either case we can be assured of
making some progress in each step, but

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.040
I'll put an asterisk here because
the notion is a little tricky.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.290
Clearly, we have a finite
number of steps,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.700
because there are only n
choose m possible bases.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.390
And because we make progress,
we don't cycle among them.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.520
Now we just need to make sure
we don't stop too early.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.410
There are two possible ways
the algorithm can terminate,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.450
either because u is nonpositive or
rD is.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.500
Let's consider the termination
because of u first.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.660
This turns out to be pretty trivial.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.410
If u is non-positive,
then we get to keep going

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.530
in the direction of dq here,
as much as we want.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.970
Increase of the objective
value the whole way.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.780
So clearly the problem is unbounded.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.460
And of course that can't happen,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.210
because we've assumed that
the linear program is bounded.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.760
Let's consider what happens when we
terminated on the RD condition then.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.030
We'll let x star be and optimal feasible
solution that's not necessarily basic.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.830
And we'll let x be a basic
sub optimal solution.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.960
While using the basis for
this basic sub optimal solution,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.130
I can write xb star in these terms here.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.440
This just comes from
the equality constraint.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.660
And the feasibility of x star.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.030
Substituting this expression
back into the objective function

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.610
gives me this result here.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.120
This expression here is the same rD
that we obtained in the simplex method,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.200
and because x is suboptimal, we then
have this strict inequality here.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.330
Because x is basic and B is its basis,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.120
however XD is 0, so
we can simply annihilate this term.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.180
Also, XD star is non negative, so for

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.390
the strict inequality to hold, at least
one entry of rD must be positive.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.730
Hence, if there's a better solution,
the simplex algorithm won't terminate.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.790
That wraps up the case where
the program is bounded.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.770
How about when it's unbounded?

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.860
Well by the same argument just given,

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.080
we won't hit the case
where rD is non-positive.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.720
And the algorithm can't run forever,
because it avoids cycling.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.820
And thus can only visit
each of the bases once.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.930
The only remaining possibility is that
u will be non-positive at some point.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.070
And we'll report that the problem
is unbounded, which, indeed, it is.
