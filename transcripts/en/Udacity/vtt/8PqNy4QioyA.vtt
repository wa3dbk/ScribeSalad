00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.040
It's time to work on
our weather app again.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.950
It's time for
you to display some real data.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.119
Well, sort of real data.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.520
There are two parts to this task.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.090
One, simulate the server injecting
the initial weather forecast

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.420
into the app js file.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.930
You can copy the initial
weather forecast data

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.570
from the instructor notes below.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.380
Second, modify the code to display the
weather data as soon as the app loads.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.350
When you're done,
the app should load quickly and

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.900
immediately display
the initial weather data.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.840
And, don't forget to try your
app in multiple browsers.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.290
How does it work in Firefox,
Safari, etc?

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.390
Be sure to compare your app to the link
in the instructor notes below,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.350
to make sure it works exactly the same.
