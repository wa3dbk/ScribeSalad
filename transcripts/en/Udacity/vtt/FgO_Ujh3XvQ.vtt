00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.019
Apple defined Swift functions as
self-contained to chunks of code

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.460
that perform a specific task.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.060
There are three main types
of functions and swift.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.590
Global functions,
Nested functions, and methods.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.790
Nested functions
are slightly more advanced.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.410
So we're going to focus on global
functions and methods for the moment.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.410
Global functions are functions that
can be called from anywhere in an app.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.720
Global function syntax is easy to
recognize because global functions

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.820
are called by a particular object.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.520
They're just called sort
of floating in thin air.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.200
One global function that you're
sure to be intimately familiar with

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.950
by now is print.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.950
Global functions like print can be
called from anywhere within a class.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.460
On the other hand,
when a function is defined in

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.600
an associated with a particular class,
we call that function a method.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.370
The vast majority of Swift functions
that you write and call will be methods.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.540
Here we have a method called sum of
strings which you may remember from your

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.610
exercises.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.750
It's defined within
the arithmetic class.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.480
And is also called by an instance
of the arithmetic class.
