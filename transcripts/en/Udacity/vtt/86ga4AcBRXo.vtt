00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.430
So let's have a look at some of the

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.830
implications of using multiple filters. This one is a concern.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.340
Deployed apps must have composite indexes for all filter combinations.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.340
If you try to run a query for which the

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.200
composite index does not exist, you will get an

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.880
error. Your users will see the error on the deployed

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.360
app, so be very careful about that. Do the multiple

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.680
filters per query increase data store writes? Definitely they do,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.320
so for the conference for every time you write an

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.600
index entry, you have multiple writes every time you save

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.460
the conference. And again, the more index entries you have

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.350
the more space they take up in the data store. So

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.730
let's take a look at what the index configuration file

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.520
might look like. We have a lot of different index

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.120
entries in here. I'm not going to read through them all

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.640
but you can see that, know we have one for conference,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.990
filter by city, sorting by name, conference, filtering

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.300
by top pick, sorting by name, and so on

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.120
and so on. So, for every possible combination that

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.890
you going to allow the user to filter on, you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.050
need to add that combination to your index

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.450
configuration file. And here we're looking at the indexes

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.130
in the data store viewer and the admin console.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.150
I just uploaded my app with all the indexes.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.900
And you see they're busy preparing. But you see how

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.150
many of them there are. You need to be aware of

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.170
the need for indexes. Every query that your users are going

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.610
to make has to have an index. And if it requires

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.830
a composite index, you're going to need to make sure that

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.680
the composite index exists on your application. And although this combination

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.300
of filters uses many indexes, the results of the queries are

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.490
fast because every search is pre-indexed so the query performance scales

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.070
with the size of the result set, not the input

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.810
data set. It's one of the great things about App Engine.
