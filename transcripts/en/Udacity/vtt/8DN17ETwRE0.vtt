00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I made up a bigger test.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I made up a dictionary of hands that map from a hand to a set of words that I found.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The idea here is that this test is not so much proving that I've got the right answer,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because I don't know for sure that this is the right answers.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Rather, this is what we call a regression test, meaning as we change our program

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we want to make sure that we haven't broken any of these--that we haven't made changes to our functions.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Even if I don't know this is exactly the right set, I want to know when I made a change,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
have I changed the result here.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'll be able to rerun this and say, have we done exactly the same thing.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'll also be able to time the results of running these various hands

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and see if we can make our function faster.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Here is my list of hands. I've got eight hands.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Then I did some further tests here.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm testing removing letters--got all those right.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Then I'm going through the hands, and I'm using my timedcall() function that we build last time.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That returnsin lapsed time and a set of results.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I make sure all the results are what I expected.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Then I return the time elapsed for finding all the words in those eight hands.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It turns out it takes half a second.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That kind of worries me. That doesn't sound very good.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Sure, if I was playing Scrabble with a friend and they reply in a half second, that'd be pretty good.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Much better than me, for example.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
In this game here it says that I haven't replied to my friend Ken in 22 hours.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is a lot better, but still, if we're going to be doing a lot of work

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and trying to find the best possible play, half a second to evaluate eight hands--

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that doesn't seem fast enough.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Why is find_words() so slow?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
One thing is that it's got a lot of nested loops, and it always does all of them.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
A lot of that is going to be wasteful.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
For example, let's say the first two letters in the hand were z and q.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
At the very start here w is z + q, and now I loop through all the other combinations

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
of all the other letters in the hand trying to find words that start with z + q,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
but there aren't any words in the dictionary that start with zq.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
As soon as I got here, I should be able to figure that out

00:02:15.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and not do all of the rest of these nested loops.
