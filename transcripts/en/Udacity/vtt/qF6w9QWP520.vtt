00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.330
So now I can run my app but

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.060
it's probably not going to work
because I haven't set up the API key.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.260
The next thing that you should do
is to go to the Google console and

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.150
then based on the name of the app,
like in this case you can see

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.820
my app is at
com.google.devplat.lmoroney.maps3_2.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.800
I need to set that up
within the API console.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.740
So if you remember in
the earlier lesson,

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.190
when we created public API access,
we had an API key and

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.820
we had Android applications that
were allowed to use that API key and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.650
these were defined by the SHA 1,
in this case the debug one.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.110
Followed by a semi-colon,
followed by the name of the application.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.280
Now you can see here I've done
the same thing, the same SHA 1.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.820
And now this application,
com.google.devplat.lmoroney.maps3_2.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.060
This is the most common place you go
wrong in writing applications and

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.180
creating them.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.340
Is that either you've named this
incorrectly, you've made a mistake

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.160
with the SHA 1 key, your API key is
wrong or something along those lines.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.602
So if you this API key beginning
with Alza and ending with d or

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:09.220
z8, if I go back to Android Studio and

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.420
go to my Android manifest,
you can see I have, it was Aiza.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.880
Sorry, not Alza.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.690
You can see I have the API key set up
here correctly and it's definitely

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.750
the same name application
com.google.devplat.lmaroney.maps3_2.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.595
A little pro tip is if you ever
refactor it, and you'll think you've

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:32.375
refactored and you've gotten everything
changed if you refactor the name of your

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:35.895
package and you'll find that
maps don't actually work.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.305
What can happen is that
while your refactor it and

00:01:38.305 --> 00:01:42.725
while you've changed it on the console
in refactoring in buildup Gradle

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:45.755
the application id string
here may not change.

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:48.915
So if you ever refactor your app and
find trouble, just make sure to

00:01:48.915 --> 00:01:53.530
come back into your buildup Gradle and
make sure that the string here with

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.740
an application ID matches
the refactoring that you've done.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.900
So let's now run the application and
take a look.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.340
And here it is again.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.540
Here's the application running.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.320
You can see I'm centered
on New York City.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.880
I have my three buttons
laid out across the top.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.038
Remember, that was
the horizontal layout.

00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:14.165
And then the entire thing is in a
vertical layout with the button panel on

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:18.014
top of the actual map fragment and
of course I can continue to pan and

00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:20.043
zoom around the map if I so desire.

00:02:20.043 --> 00:02:22.004
And when I press the buttons,
for example the hybrid button,

00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:24.188
I now get a hybrid map, which you'll
see more closely if I zoom in, so

00:02:24.188 --> 00:02:25.736
you can see the street
names were highlighted and

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:27.157
the streets themselves were highlighted.

00:02:27.157 --> 00:02:29.051
And when I press the buttons for
example, the hybrid button,

00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:31.099
I now get a hybrid map, which you'll
see more closely if I zoom in.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.395
So I have the satellite
photographic map,

00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:37.472
but with the lines of roads and things
laid out on top of it, which is really,

00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:40.496
really useful when you're
navigating around places.

00:02:40.496 --> 00:02:44.120
Or if I just want the pure
satellite picture, here it is.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.340
So it was as simple as that.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.230
Very little coding and you're beginning
to see that you can build some pretty

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.320
powerful functionality.
