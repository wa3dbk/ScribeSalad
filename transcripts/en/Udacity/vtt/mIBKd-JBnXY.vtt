So now you've seen how diverse Udacity students are. They come from all over the

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:10.470
world, I think, over 146 countries actually. What else do we want to know about

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:15.285
Udacity students? Ron, Shawn, and I think that people should be life-long

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:20.248
learners, and a lot of our students value learning beyond high school and

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.516
college. And then other students want to get head start on things that they wont

00:00:25.528 --> 00:00:30.527
learn for another few years. As a result, we get students as young as 13 and as

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.560
old as 85. Just like how we analyzed countries students are from, how about we

00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:40.745
analyze their ages? So here's a sample of student ages, and again we have 50.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.928
How can we analize this data the same way we analyzed the country data? So

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.423
instead of having country in the frequency data, we have age. How can we create

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:56.475
this table? How many rows would you have? Would you need 50, one for each

00:00:56.487 --> 00:01:02.550
student in the sample, or maybe 66 rows, one for each age from 10 years to 75

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:09.707
years? 8 to 10 rows because that's just easiest to understand? It depends on how

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:15.919
you group the data, or 2 rows, one for over 50 years old and one for under 50

00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:16.785
years old.
