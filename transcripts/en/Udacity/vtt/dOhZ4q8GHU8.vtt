00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.719
In one way machine learning grew
out of artificial intelligence,

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.370
artificial intelligence was about
creating machines that were themselves,

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.870
as smart as humans.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.470
And along the way the field diverged
into different schools of thought,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.170
including cognitive system which is
focused on thinking like humans.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.860
And machine learning,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.980
which is focused on creating machines
that act autonomously in general.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.000
Regardless of whether or
not they're thinking like humans do, so

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.620
to start our conversation
about machine learning,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.490
let's talk a little bit about
artificial intelligence in general.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.820
And where machine learning fits in, to
do this we're going to borrow from one

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.955
of the classes at Georgia Tech called
Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence.

00:00:31.955 --> 00:00:32.970
It's taught by Ashok Goel and I, and

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.560
the video that you're about to see
are covered very early in the course.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.090
If you're interested you can find a link
to the full course in the instructor's

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.620
notes below.
