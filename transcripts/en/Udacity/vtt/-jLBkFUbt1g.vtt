00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.960
Apps use a navigation
structure to present views

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.410
when each page is a part of
a hierarchy or a flat sequence.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.150
Users make one choice per page, and

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.650
can retrace their steps to
make different choices.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.660
Such a hierarchy often takes
the form of a list of items,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.070
each with a detail page.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.059
Apps use modal presentation for things
like temporary views and alert views.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.020
As well as self contained activities
that only offer the choice

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.350
to be completed or dismissed.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.930
In this lesson,
we'll focus on modal presentation.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.520
Navigation will come in lesson four.
