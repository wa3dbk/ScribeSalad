00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.960
When solving an inequality, I want to solve it just like an equation. I'm going

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.090
to clear factions, clear groupings, and then combine variables on both sides.

00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:12.112
First, I'm going to distribute this negative 3. So, I have negative 3 times x

00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:15.876
and negative 3 times 4. I'm going to combine like terms to get negative 10.

00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:19.980
Next, I'm going to add 10 to both sides. Then, I can add x to both sides to

00:00:19.992 --> 00:00:24.534
isolate my variable on one side of the inequality sign. So, I have negative 2x

00:00:24.638 --> 00:00:29.096
is greater than or equal to 18. So, I'm left with positive x over here on the

00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:33.524
left, and negative 9 on the right. I'm left with x is less than or equal to

00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:38.262
negative 9. Remember, I divided by a negative value here, so I have to reverse

00:00:38.274 --> 00:00:43.783
the inequality sign. Here's the number line solution, x less than negative 9,

00:00:43.903 --> 00:00:46.340
and here's the interval notation.
