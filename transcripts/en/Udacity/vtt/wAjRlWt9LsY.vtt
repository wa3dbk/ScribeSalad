Reflecting in the x axis requires replacing y with negative y. Which means

00:00:04.821 --> 00:00:09.646
negating the entire function. So I've made the whole right side of the function

00:00:09.646 --> 00:00:14.640
negative. Now we could also of course distribute this negative to the two terms

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.677
that we have. That would give us negative, the quantity x minus1 to the 4th,

00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:22.079
plus 1. Either way works.
