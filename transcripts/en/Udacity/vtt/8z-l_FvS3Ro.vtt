00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.726
For our patio, the dimensions are 12 by 9. The length is 12 feet long, and the

00:00:04.726 --> 00:00:10.744
width is 9 feet long. Great thinking if you found these two numbers. Now, this

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:14.250
required us to solve a quadratic equation. So don't worry if they give you

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.560
trouble. We haven't even done a problem like this yet. We're going to start by

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.400
taking our area equation, and we're going to replace this l with the expression

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.006
21 minus w. We want to make sure we use parentheses, here, since we're

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:32.695
replacing this l with this expression. We'll need to multiply w to each of

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:39.141
these terms inside the parentheses. So, 21 times w equals 21w, and negative w

00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:46.895
times w is negative w squared. We need to set this equation equal to 0. So, we

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:52.140
arrange these two terms and move them to the other side. So, we'll subtract 21w

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.060
from both sides, and add w squared to both sides. This leaves us with w

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.517
squared, minus 21w, plus 108 equals 0. Now we're ready to try to factor our

00:01:03.517 --> 00:01:08.946
quadratic. We want to find factors of 1 times 108. Or just 108 that sum to

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:15.130
negative 21. Those two factors are negative 9 and negative 12. If we set each

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.400
factor equal to 0, then we know that w could equal positive 9, or w can equal

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.560
positive 12. And maybe this is where you might have gotten confused. We have

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.811
the width can equal 9, or the width can equal 12. If the width does equal 9, we

00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:35.056
know that the entire perimeter should be 42. So doing some mental math, we know

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:38.900
that the length would have to be 12 in order for the entire perimeter to be 42

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.650
feet. We could get that same result by using our area formula. We know this

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.412
area is 108. And now we know the width. The width is 9, so we divide both sides

00:01:50.412 --> 00:01:56.320
by 9 to get the length, is equal to 12 or 12 feet. Now if we would have let the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.608
width equal 12 feet, we would have gotten this rectangle. It's really the same

00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:05.224
exact rectangle, it's just been rotated 90 degrees. The longest dimension of a

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:10.002
closed figure or any three dimensional shape is considered to be the length. So

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:13.215
instead of making the width equal 12, we'll make the length equal 12, and the

00:02:13.215 --> 00:02:18.128
width equal 9. Finally it's always best to check your result, to make sure that

00:02:18.128 --> 00:02:22.135
the perimeter and the area are what we expect it to be. If we add up all the

00:02:22.135 --> 00:02:25.555
sides together, we get a perimeter of 42, just like what was stated in our

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:30.798
problem. And if we multiply the length and the width, we get an area of 108

00:02:30.798 --> 00:02:34.970
square feet. This is why we know these two answers are correct.
