Like we did before, we're going to start off by identifying the constant factors

00:00:05.613 --> 00:00:10.809
in this term, and then moving them to the front of the term. So our constant

00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:16.354
factors here are negative 5, negative 2, and 3. So we can write negative 5 times

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:21.824
negative 2 times 3, as the first three factors of our rewritten version of this

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:26.363
term. Then after that come the variables, s, r and t. So you multiply the

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:31.127
constant factors by the variable factors. Remember that these multiplication

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:35.966
signs between the variables actually aren't necessary. So I'm just going to get

00:00:35.978 --> 00:00:40.612
rid of those right away. Now, negative 5 times negative 2 is just positive 10.

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:46.175
Remember, a negative times a negative. Equals a positive. So then we have 10

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:52.069
times 3, and 10 times 3 is just equal to 30. So we can replace negative 5 times

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:58.062
negative 2 times 3 with 30, and then multiply that with the rest of the factors

00:00:58.074 --> 00:01:03.968
that are left over, srt. So our final simplified version of this term is 30 srt.

00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:08.982
Now to my eye, this looks much easier to deal with than this initial version of

00:01:08.994 --> 00:01:13.712
the term did. So I think we are making really good progress toward simplifying

00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:15.102
different expressions.
