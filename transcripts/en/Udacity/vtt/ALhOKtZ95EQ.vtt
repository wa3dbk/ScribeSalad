00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.350
One important decision in the design of the

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.270
modern routers was to place a copy of

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.940
the forwarding table on each line card in

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.720
the router. Well, this introduces some complications in

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.630
making copies of the forwarding table. Doing so,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.590
prevents a central table on the router from

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.840
becoming a bottleneck at high speeds. Consider an

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.320
alternative where the router only has one copy of

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.500
forwarding table. . In that case all of the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.650
line cards would need to be performing look ups on

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.620
a central table. Which involves communication across the back

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.320
plane as well as many more look ups against a

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.620
central table. So while distributing the forwarding table across

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.470
line cards prevents a central table from becoming a bottleneck.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.470
Early router architectures did not place the look up table

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.590
on each line card, and as a result, when packets

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.900
arrived at an individual line card, they would induce

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.250
a look up in a shared buffer memory which

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.560
could be accessed over a shared bus. But this

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.800
shared bus, of course, introduces a bottleneck as well

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.390
as contention between the different line cards that may

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.900
be all performing lookups to the same shared memory.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.140
The solution, of course, was thus to remove the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.980
shared memory and instead place copies of the forwarding

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.800
table on each line card. In summary, An

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.440
important innovation in the design of these router

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.220
was to eliminate the shared bus and place

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.480
the look up table on individual line bus.
