When the switch sees the frame from host D, destined for host B, it doesn't

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.998
know what to do with the frame, so it forwards that frame on all of

00:00:09.998 --> 00:00:12.610
its output ports. However, because it sees

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.360
a frame arrive from source D, it knows

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.751
that future frames that are destined for source D should be output on port four.
