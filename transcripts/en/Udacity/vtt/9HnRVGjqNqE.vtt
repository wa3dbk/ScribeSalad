00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.770
Based on the question I want to answer.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.990
At this point the next task
that would make sense for

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.300
me to do is to split
the data into two groups.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.040
Data for students who eventually
pass the first project and for

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.340
students who don't.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.330
But I have all this data about students'
engagement in the first week, and

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.310
I'm getting curious.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.890
I want to take a look at it.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.380
My rule of thumb is when I'm curious
about my data, I investigate.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.270
Getting a better sense of your
data is almost always useful.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.820
In this case,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.860
I'll probably be able to reuse some
of the code I'm writing later.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.890
But even if that weren't true, exploring
your data is never a waste of time for

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.520
a data analyst.
