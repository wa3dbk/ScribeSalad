00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.906
The answer is (q(p(n))).

00:00:02.906 --> 00:00:07.710
It's tempting to think that we run N and
then we run M.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.270
So, the total running time should
just be the sum of the two

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.300
individual running times.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.750
The trouble with this,
is that it doesn't account for

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.570
the possibility that the output of N
could be much longer than the input.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.780
In fact, it could be almost p(n).

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.455
Most of the program's instructions
could have been print statements, or

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:30.916
writes to the end of the tape for
Turing machines.

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:39.040
So that the output of N is p(n) long and
would then take q(p(n)) time.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.370
And then that becomes
the dominant factor in our bound.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.390
In particular, this means that if both
p and q are bounded by polynomials,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.560
then the running time of the composition
will also be bounded by a polynomial,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.290
since the composition of two
polynomials is a polynomial.
