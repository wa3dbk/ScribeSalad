00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.830
So let's do another superscalar versus VLIW comparison

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.080
as a quiz. Let's say we have an

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.960
out of order superscalar processor and a VLIW

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.790
processor. Let's say the out of order superscalar processor

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.920
executes thirty two bit instructions while the VLIW

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.330
executes one hundred twenty eight bit instructions. Where

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.950
each VLIW instruction specifies four operations. Each of

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.220
these operations is similar to what one of these

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.060
instructions on a superscalar browser can do. If we

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.540
have a program for the other superscalar that is 4000

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.670
bytes in length, we can say the the VLIW program

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.620
size will be between how many, and how many bytes.
