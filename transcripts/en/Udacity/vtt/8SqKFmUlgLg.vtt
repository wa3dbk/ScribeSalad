00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.810
Physiologically, stimulants can increase your heart rate, your blood pressure,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.984
and your respiration. They can also decrease your appetite. Now, it's important

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:12.798
to know that this increase in heart rate is really dangerous. Some people have

00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:15.806
actually died the very first time they've ever used a major stimulant such as

00:00:15.806 --> 00:00:21.005
cocaine or methamphetamine. Long-term consequence of using the major stimulants

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:26.162
such as cocaine and methamphetamine also result in formication. And this is the

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:30.342
feeling of little bugs crawling under the person's skin. As a result, people

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:33.938
often pick and scratch at their skin, which results in open wounds and

00:00:33.938 --> 00:00:39.830
increased likelihood for infection. Another consequence is called meth mouth.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.452
And I recommend that you Google that and you can see some unfortunate

00:00:42.452 --> 00:00:47.627
descriptions of what that is. Finally, long term use of these major stimulants

00:00:47.627 --> 00:00:53.003
in some people, can result in what is called stimuli-induced psychosis. And

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:56.318
here, the individual thinks and behaves somewhat similarly to somebody with

00:00:56.318 --> 00:01:00.935
schizophrenia. Some of the other long term consequences of major stimulant use

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:06.003
are hypervigilance, sleep deprivation, anxiety and paranoia. Long-term

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.928
methamphetamine use can also dramatically age you. If you Google faces and

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:15.382
meth, you can see just how dramatically meth can affect your appearance. When

00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:19.470
people abuse the major stimulants, they often go on what is called a run.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.053
Meaning, they'll continuously take the drug and stay awake for maybe two to

00:01:22.053 --> 00:01:26.345
three days at a time. Now, we know that our bodies simply can't stay awake that

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:31.140
long and eventually the person will crash. Due to the crash, they're going to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.080
experience depression, extreme fatigue, and sometimes even suicidal thoughts.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.984
In addition, because the person starts to undergo withdrawal, they usually

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:45.408
begin drug-seeking behavior again. Now, let's go back and take a review of the

00:01:45.408 --> 00:01:46.690
major stimulants.
