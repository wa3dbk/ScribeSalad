00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.926
Athena has a new problem that she's really stumped by. Her boss at the

00:00:03.926 --> 00:00:07.620
architecture firm, left her with an important project. Working on the plans for

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.458
this awesome new building that's going to go on Grant's business property. Now,

00:00:11.458 --> 00:00:15.508
this building is special because it's a triangular prism. That means that if we

00:00:15.508 --> 00:00:19.440
look at the building from above, the roof is shaped like a triangle. In this

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.139
case, it's actually a right triangle. All the faces down here though, are

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:26.880
rectangles. Athena worked really hard to come up with an equation for the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.488
volume of this building, depending on each of the side lengths. This one, this

00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:35.400
one and this one. But unfortunately, she had a disaster with a cup of green tea

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.322
and the sheet of paper she was working on. Now, all that she has left on her

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:44.476
paper is the equation for volume in the way that she expressed the length of

00:00:44.476 --> 00:00:50.706
one side, the height here, which she labeled 2x plus 8. Now, this expression

00:00:50.706 --> 00:00:54.340
for volume is found by finding the area of the right triangle, that we see here

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.708
on the roof. And multiplying that by the height. Let me write that out for you.

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:03.216
There we go. A nice word equation for you. So, let's see if we can combine all

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:06.732
this information together. Given that Athena already figured out this

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:10.600
expression for the total volume of the building and she knows that the height

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.800
is 2x plus 8. And also, if we decide to call the area of this top triangle A,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.277
how could you write a new equation, replacing this one in black, that only

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:23.710
involves the variables X and A? Just use these new expressions for volume,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.730
height and area and put them in the proper places, as shown in this block

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.853
equation.
