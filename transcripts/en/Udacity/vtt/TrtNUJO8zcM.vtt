00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.727
Okay, so now we have the lay out for
our activities as designed, and

00:00:03.727 --> 00:00:06.310
our manifest and
grader files are set up.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.430
So the next thing to do
is to write the code.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.750
If you haven't done so already,
open up the main activity and

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.120
at the top you'll see there
are a number of imports.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.460
We have to add a few more.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.010
Let's take a look at what they'll be,
I'll just paste them in.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.900
So you can see here, these are the
imports that we're going to be using.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.390
Things such as the login utility,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.930
the text View control that
we've seen earlier on.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.020
A location object that we're using for
determining location details, and

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.880
then all this stuff that's going to
be used by the location services;

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.390
connection results, API client,
connection call backs,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.130
the on connection failed listener.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.210
And of course the location
services themselves.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.350
So these provide all the classes
that we're going to be using, and

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.160
next we're going to edit
main activity code itself.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.790
We can see that the basic one that we
have just extends action bar activity,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.180
but we need a few more interfaces.
