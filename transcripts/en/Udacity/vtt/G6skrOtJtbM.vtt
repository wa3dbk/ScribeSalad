00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.660
Let's look a bit more in depth at how this box in space actually gets

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.708
positioned and defined internally. First, we define our camera object as

00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:09.684
looking down the world's negative z axis and oriented so that the top of the

00:00:09.684 --> 00:00:14.310
camera is facing along the plus y axis. The camera starts at the origin, just

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.248
like other objects. The first step is to move the camera to where we want to

00:00:17.248 --> 00:00:21.862
make an image from. We also tilt and orient the camera as desired. This is

00:00:21.862 --> 00:00:25.230
similar to how we have been orienting objects all along. We define some sort of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.999
rotation in translation to get your camera into place. We ignore scale, we're

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.162
just trying to set up the camera in space. Giving the camera a position is

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:35.827
simple enough. To compute the rotation needed to orient our camera, we use

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:40.234
what's called a look at system. This is pretty much what it sounds like. You

00:00:40.234 --> 00:00:43.664
define a target location for what direction you want the camera to look. This

00:00:43.664 --> 00:00:46.914
defines the negative z axis for the camera's frame of reference. In other

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:50.724
words, how it's pointing in the world. So here I have a real live camera, it

00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:55.464
even works. And with my z axis here, that tells me which way it's pointing, but

00:00:55.464 --> 00:01:00.971
unfortunately it doesn't tell me which way is up. It still has this one degree

00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:05.930
of freedom. So what we do, is we also define an up-vector of some sort. This

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.140
vector gives us some guidance as to which way to orient the top of the camera.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.857
Typically in 3JS, we'll pass an up-vector such as zero, one, zero, the plus y

00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:17.200
axis as the up-vector. Given our view vector and this up-vector, we'd like to

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.736
form a matrix that defines a whole frame of reference for our camera. We know

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:25.170
where we want this z axis to look along. But we want to know where the camera's

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.556
y and x axis end up. By specifying a general up direction, we do this. For

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:33.075
example, say we have a camera pointing in some direction. Looking along its

00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:36.469
negative z axis. If we give an up direction, we can find the direction pointing

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.860
to the right of the camera. Which is the x axis. By taking the cross product of

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.330
this z axis and our up vector. Now we have two axis locked down. Camera z and

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.164
camera x. We can find the true up direction, the camera's y axis, by then

00:01:50.164 --> 00:01:54.585
taking the cross product of the x and z axis. Remember that the cross product

00:01:54.585 --> 00:01:58.610
of two vectors will give us the vector that's perpendicular to both of them.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.890
This may all sound a bit odd and like a lot of work but is extremely common.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.338
It's probably the place where I use the cross product the most. The whole point

00:02:05.338 --> 00:02:08.051
here is that given a view direction and an up vector as a hint, we can get a

00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:12.537
frame of reference for the camera. We'll often use the worlds plus y axis as

00:02:12.537 --> 00:02:16.576
our up vector hint, but it all depends. Say we're a hawk soaring over some

00:02:16.576 --> 00:02:20.610
terrain. We're looking straight down, which would be looking down the y axis of

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.181
our world. If we use the world's y axis as our hint, it doesn't make much

00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:28.140
sense. We define the negative z axis the camera's looking along, and the y axis

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.802
for the camera's up direction. As vectors in exactly opposite directions. This

00:02:33.802 --> 00:02:36.867
is not very useful. In this case our up vector is more like the direction

00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:40.431
pointing out of the top of our hawk's head, the direction it's flying. Now that

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:42.968
the up vector is not parallel to the look at direction, we can form a good

00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:45.150
frame of reference for the hawk.
