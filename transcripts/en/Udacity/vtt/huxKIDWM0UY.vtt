00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The challenged problem for this problem set

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is essentially an extension of what's already done in the first problem.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Instead of checking whether a Sudoku board is valid, we're actually going to be solving

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the Sudoku board and coming up with a valid solution assuming that it is valid.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So, we're going to be extending new check Sudoku function.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Since I don't know what you wrote, then I invite you to paste this in

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or paste it into something else, run it locally, and then give your findings on the forum

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and the code for people to handle has end and hopefully break.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now, our Sudoku solver is going to be essentially an extension,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so it should return None for broken input just like check_Sudoku does.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
False for inputs with no valid solutions and a valid 9/9 Sudoku grid

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
containing no zero elements at the end.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Any 0 elements that are in board that's pass N assuming it's valid

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
should be solved and changed into numbers one through nine that give a valid solution.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
There are a lot of ways you can do that.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There are a lot of clever ways to solve a partially completed Sudoku board.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We could always just go with brute-force recursive solution

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
may be not the best idea if people end up testing against very, very difficult puzzles,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and you can come up with some really pathologically evil Sudoku puzzles

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
if you don't have fast algorithm.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The one I'll be showing you in the solution video is essentially just a brute-force algorithm.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Please give some example of some Sudoku puzzles

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that maybe it wouldn't fair so well against or maybe it would take a very, very long time to complete.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We're going to be running this in the equator against the same Sudoku puzzles.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Hardest commented out by default because for a more naive Sudoku solver,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it will take a little bit of time maybe five to 10 seconds or so

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
depending on exactly how you plotted it out to actually solve this one

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and there are going to be multiple different solutions depending on exactly how you code this up.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We are going to be checking that.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We would simply be checking that it's a valid Sudoku board with no zeros.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And again, I invite you to post your solution code in the forums,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
how you coded it out, what you think it might be vulnerable to,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and to break other people's code and see how you would test against a Sudoku solver,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
which is a bit more complicated of a piece of code than the checker itself.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
There are a few more ways that things can go wrong.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Okay, I hope you had fun with this, and I hope you enjoy breaking everyone else's code.
