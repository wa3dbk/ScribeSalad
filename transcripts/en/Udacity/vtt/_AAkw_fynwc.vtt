00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
With a little bit of math we find that the new mean is 12.4,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and the new sigma-squared is 1.6.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
12.4 is much closer to 13 than 10, and that's because the Gaussian centered on 13

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
has a much narrower variance than the one on 10.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We find the resulting variance is smaller than each of the two variances over here.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In particular, let's start with the variance.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.000
1 over 1/8 plus 1/2 is the same as 1 over 5/8, which results in 8/5 or 1.6.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This is just applying this formula over here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
For the weighted average we get 2 times 10 plus 8 times 13.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Then we normalize by the sum of those two things over here.

00:00:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So this is 124 divided by 10, which gives us 12.4.
