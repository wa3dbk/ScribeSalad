00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.820
So the question for you is, how many messages

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.070
are exchanged among all the nodes for each lock

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.880
acquisition followed by a lock release? Every process, what

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.320
it is doing is making a lock request and

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.630
it follows the algorithm that we just mentioned, uses

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.070
the lock in the critical section. And once it

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.990
is done with that, it unlocks by sending messages

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.330
again as you saw. And the question to you

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.420
is, how many messages are exchanged among

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.850
all the nodes for each lock acquisition followed

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.950
by a lock release? That is, combination of

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.960
lock plus unlock. How many messages does it

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.110
generate? Is it N minus one messages? 2 to the n minus 1? Or 3

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.800
to the n minus 1, where n is, the number of nodes in the distributed system.
