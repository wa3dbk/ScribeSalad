00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.522
The answer is 5 over 2. Let's say I want to start at this point right here, the

00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:11.206
point 0,1. I can find another point that lies on this line that's easy to pick

00:00:11.218 --> 00:00:16.915
out, like this one right here, point 2,6 and figure out that we count over one,

00:00:16.927 --> 00:00:22.114
two, to the right, and then up from there, one, two, three, four, five. So we

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:26.508
take five and divide it by two and that gives us the slope. We can also see that

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.468
if we wanted to step over one to the right, we would need to step up 2 and a

00:00:30.468 --> 00:00:34.445
half units to be back on the line and 2 and a half is equivalent to 5 halves.
