00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.310
You start with the shiny teapot on the left, surrounded by a sky box. Assign

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.220
this sky box cube map in the code to be environment map for the teapot itself.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.140
See the documentation about the teapots material for help. When you assign the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.940
map, you'll get the result on the right. If you do only one exercise during the

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.240
whole course, make it this one. It's easy and result is stunning.
