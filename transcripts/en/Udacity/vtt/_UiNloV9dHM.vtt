00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.641
As I said in the past several videos and
quizzes, there are a ton of mathematically

00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:09.443
equivalent ways of writing any expression
we might have. For example, if I rearrange

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:13.749
the factors within any of the terms here,
or rearrange the order of the terms

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:18.210
themselves, or let's say, tack on a 0 at
the end. The value of the expression on

00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:22.156
the right side of the equation doesn't
change. However, there are certain

00:00:22.168 --> 00:00:26.541
convienient ways of writing expressions.
Ways that actually make them simplier to

00:00:26.553 --> 00:00:30.537
deal with that we're going to want to use.
We call this process of rewriting

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:34.980
expressions; simplifing expressions. One
really useful tool that can help us start

00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:39.316
to simplify and expression, or see if we
can simplify it any further, is to change

00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:43.537
the order of the terms. We know that we're
allowed to do this because of the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:47.780
communitive property of addition. So, how
could we do that here? Let's just

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:51.790
rearrange the terms on the right side of
this equation so that both terms

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:56.180
containing w are in the first two slots
and the two terms containing n are in the

00:00:56.192 --> 00:01:00.985
last two slots. So please just type the
proper terms into the proper slots. These

00:01:00.997 --> 00:01:06.765
smaller spaces are for plus or minus signs
but you can also type in as you see fit.
