00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.375
So like any other
theory of intelligence,

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:04.810
case-based reasoning
has some assumptions.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.540
The first assumption is that there
are patterns to the problems that

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.690
agents encounter in the world.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.400
The same kinds of problem tend
to reoccur, again and again.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.330
A lot of science is about finding
patterns that are crowded in the world.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.090
Physics finds patterns that
are crowded in the world that

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.550
are expressed by various kinds of laws,
like Newton's second law of motion.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.950
Presumably, if you're going to build
a theory of intelligence, that theory

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.479
too will give an account of what kind of
patterns exist in the world that mind,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.300
that intelligence, must encounter.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.060
And case-based reasoning says,
one of the common patterns is

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.660
that the same kinds of problems
occur again, and again, and again.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.850
So that's the first assumption.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.580
The second assumption is that similar
problems often have similar solutions.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.700
Here is a grid of a part of Long Island.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.520
Here is a grid of part of Dallas, Texas.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.550
Now if you look at the one in
Long Island, you can see that

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.780
if there are two problems which
are very close to each other,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.570
they're likely to have
very similar solutions.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.480
And the same is true for
the grid in Dallas.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.920
Similarly, the second
assumption is not always valid.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.750
Here is an example of it.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.940
I'm sure all of you know
how to tie your shoelaces.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.000
But imagine that you buy
a new pair of shoes, and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.650
this new pair of shoes
have velcro straps.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.120
Now the problem's very similar,
how to tighten your shoes, but

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.290
the solution is radically different.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.950
&gt;&gt; So Ashoke, another example of
this that comes to mind, for me,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.220
is the example of touch screens.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.260
Some of the early touch screens could
only handle one touch at a time.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.410
If you touched it with two fingers at
a time, it either wouldn't register, or

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.590
it'd only register one of the touches.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.360
Current touchscreens, on smartphones and

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.840
tablet's that we use today, can handle
two or three or four fingers at a time.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.470
The problem is very similar.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.570
We're still touching the screen and
interacting with it with our fingers,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.650
but the solution is actually very,
very different.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.650
It uses a completely different kind
of technology, different material for

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.430
the screen, and

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.130
a different way of detecting where
the screen is being touched.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.720
&gt;&gt; That's a good example, David.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.490
So we have at least two examples
now where similar problems can have

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.510
quite different solutions.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.510
Nevertheless, this assumption
is valid most of the time.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.310
Most of the time,
two problems that are quite similar

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.930
will end up having two solutions
that are quite similar, as well.
