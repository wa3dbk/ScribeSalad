00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.910
Now we're ready to write the code for crawling the

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.200
web. So our goal is to define a procedure, we'll

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.550
call it crawl_web, that takes as input a seed page

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.680
url. So, that's the url that identifies our seed page, and

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.170
outputs a list of all the urls that can be

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.460
reached by following links starting from the seed page. So,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.800
if you're really ambitious you should try to do this

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.400
yourself without anymore help. That's going to be a pretty tough challenge.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.780
So we're also going to step through one way to do

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.280
this as a series of quizzes. But you should feel free

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.310
at any point, when you feel confident that you can do

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.960
it yourself, to try to finish for yourself, rather than following

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.250
the step by step quizzes that I'll show you. So we

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.260
will start defining our procedure crawl web, and we are going

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.810
to introduce two variables. The tocrawl variable that keeps track

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.560
of the pages that we need to crawl, and the crawled

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.330
variable that is a list of pages that we

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.820
have already crawled. For the first step, your goal

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.140
is to figure out, how to initialize these variables.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.290
Which of the first value, tocrawl and crawled be?
