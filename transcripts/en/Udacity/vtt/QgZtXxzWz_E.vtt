00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.880
This lesson is about doing a search or
BFS on a distributive memory system.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.680
But we're going to approach the problem
from the perspective of linear algebra.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.420
As it happens, there's a way
to view a graph as a matrix.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.540
And since we have a pretty

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.830
good understanding of how to do linear
algebra in distributive memory,

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.520
we can exploit this mapping
to get a scalable algorithm.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.660
Now one suggestion I have for you before
we start is for you to quickly review

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.070
some of the ideas from our other lesson
on distributive matrix computations.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.120
You'll use several of those ideas here,
too.
