00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.856
Well if we go too far to the left, it means that we're going to have poor peak performance

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:07.555
because we'll be using the slower thread per element approach on

00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:11.880
data that would instead be a better fit for the faster thread per row approach.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.998
But if we go too far to the right, then we'll be using thread per row on

00:00:15.998 --> 00:00:20.426
irregular row lengths, and that's going to lead to poor load balance.

00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:24.010
Bell and Garland noted that thread per row is about 3 times faster than thread per

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.125
element for matrices with balanced rows.

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:28.668
So their rule of thumb for drawing the line was

00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:32.840
when 1/3 of the rows have non-zero elements--simple and sensible.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.582
You'll find their approach called hybrid, an NVIDIA cuSPARSE, sparse matrix library.
