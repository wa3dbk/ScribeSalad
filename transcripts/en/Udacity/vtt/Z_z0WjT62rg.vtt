00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.560
So let's see if we can compute
the size of the flat page table.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.710
Let's say that the page table
needs to have 8 bytes per entry.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.580
For example, because it has
a 64-bit physical address space.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.330
Let's say that the page size is 4 kB.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.910
Let's say that the system only has
two processes that are active.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.390
Let's say that the system only
really has 2 GB of physical memory.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.560
Let's say that the programs
are creating 32-bit virtual addresses.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.411
Let's say that the process number one
is using only 1 MB of it's available

00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:33.290
32-bit address space.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.500
And let's say that process number two
is using 1 GB of its virtual memory.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.760
It could use up to 4 GB but
it's only using 1 GB.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.450
The question for you is,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.860
what is the total size of all the page
tables in the system, in megabytes?
