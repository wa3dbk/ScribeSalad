00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We can solve this for instance by distinguishing between three different cases.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
First case, time is between 0 and 4 years, the output is 0.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Second case, the time is 6 years or greater. The output will be 0.8, the maximum sustainable yield.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Third case, we need a function to describe this line if the time is between 4 years and 6 years.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The slope of this line is 0.8 times the maximum sustainable yield

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
divided by this time span 6 years minus 4 years.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The slope is multiplied by t, but if we're just using this expression, this would be the result that we get.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
A line would intercept zero.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The trick is to subtract 4 years from that time, which would make it work.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We still have this expression still describes the line with the right slope, but if you plug in 4  years,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
this coefficient times 0 and thus the result is 0 for 4 years.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In the resulting diagram, you see how the growth of the population

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
softly bends down between 4 and 6 years,but we are not over fishing.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The implementation makes use of a factor to modify the maximum harvest rate

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
which is 0.8 times the maximum sustainable yield.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
If the time is larger than 6 years, we are using the factor of 1.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If the time is not larger than 6 ix years but it's larger than 4 years, we're using the linear ramp,

00:01:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and otherwise, we are using the factor of 0.
