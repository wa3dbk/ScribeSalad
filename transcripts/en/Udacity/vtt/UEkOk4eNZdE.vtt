00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.080
Here are the equations for a few different normal distributions. Can you

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.160
determine from their probability distributions, the

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.000
mean, standard deviation, and variance? Fill

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.120
in your answers in these boxes below. So, mean would go in

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.581
these. Standard deviation would go in here, and variance in these guys.
