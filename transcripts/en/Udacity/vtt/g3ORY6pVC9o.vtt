00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.900
For example, the Google News experience on the desktop

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.160
shows a lot of information, but the mobile experience

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.760
focuses on just the news stories. Pushing all of

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.800
the secondary information out of the way. You'll learn how

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.920
to write code that adapts to different screen sizes

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.960
and also how to make your code work offline.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.030
You'll learn how pointer input works on touch screens

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.590
and how to unlock the camera GPS and accelerometers sensors

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.460
on mobile devices. Now technically speaking you don't need

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.140
a mobile device in order to take this course or

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.590
even to test out most of what you'll learn.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.660
But you're missing a lot of the experience of mobile

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.030
web development, without a device. Preferably at least one

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.920
Android device. You can use Chrome's great mobile debugging tools.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.780
Which we'll be using in this course. But, the

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.740
more devices you have, and the more variety, the better.
