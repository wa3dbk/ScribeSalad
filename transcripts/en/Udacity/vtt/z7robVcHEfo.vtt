00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.886
Different emotions are expressed differently on the face and in our voice. Each

00:00:04.886 --> 00:00:08.918
emotion has its own unique combination of facial muscles and voice changes

00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:14.771
often involving pitch. Let's take fear for example. This involves the eyebrows

00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:19.496
being lifted and pulled together and the upper eyelids are also lifted. And the

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:23.495
lips are stretched and pulled apart. Anger, on the other hand, the eyebrows are

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:27.260
lowered and pulled together. The eye lids are tightened and the lips are

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.561
thinned and pressed together. One interesting application of analyzing facial

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:36.979
expressions of emotion. Is being able to distinguish which emotion is being

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:41.614
expressed based strictly on muscle movements. We know, or we think we know what

00:00:41.614 --> 00:00:46.661
someone's feeling, just by their face. They tell us when they're sad, angry,

00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:51.960
disgusted or happy just with their face. And as it turns out, sometimes we can

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.402
be fooled. A happy face is not always a genuinely happy face. There are in fact

00:00:57.402 --> 00:01:01.371
differences in the muscle movements of a true smile, and a social smile, or a

00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:03.329
fake smile.
