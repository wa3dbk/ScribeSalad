00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.058
There is however,

00:00:01.058 --> 00:00:03.750
another way of thinking about
the tracking that I just showed you.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.837
Let's not worry too much about
the mean shifting part of it and

00:00:07.837 --> 00:00:11.294
just this idea of using
the color distribution as a,

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:16.910
the matching of the color distribution,
the similarity as a sensor model.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.958
Okay?

00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.318
Because when we do this mean shift and
we're tracking the single peak,

00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:24.230
we're a little bit back to like
our Kalman universe, right?

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.000
Where the idea is there's
a single hypothesis.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.389
We could just use this similarity
function, the matching function

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:37.370
of the color distributions as the sensor
model for particle filtering.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.791
That is your particles spread out and
they want to say, well,

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:43.744
what's the probability
of getting this sensor

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:46.583
measurement if that's
actually the mice state.

00:00:46.583 --> 00:00:48.516
Well, you can simply say, well,

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:52.649
it's just a measure of how close the
color distribution is using that body

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.333
chart distance of some other way
of comparing of distributions.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.463
And in fact, people have done this and

00:00:58.463 --> 00:01:01.000
now I have to show you
a totally unfair slide.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.402
And the reason it's unfair
is this slide I found,

00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:09.940
I was looking is in a presentation
given online, talking about mean shift.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.449
I don't actually know the source of
this picture, so I can't give you the,

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:16.500
the reference to look it up, etc.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.375
And then they show this
interesting thing where the mean

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:25.083
shift is tracking this cute little
kid and then falls apart, okay?

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:26.560
Now why would it fall apart?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.750
This is a little bit sneaky.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.730
You'll notice this brown envelope
cardboard box in the background.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.293
It has some color distributions
similar to the face of the kid.

00:01:37.293 --> 00:01:40.004
So, if you've ever thought little kids
are really, pretty much cardboard boxes,

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:40.960
you're right.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.833
Or at least,
that's what mean shift says.

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:47.168
And then what they showed is that
if you used a particle tracker,

00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:50.800
particle filter tracker,
it falls off a little bit.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.000
See, it fell off, but
then it catches back on.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.840
That's what particle filters do, right?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.167
They entertain multiple hypothesis.

00:01:59.167 --> 00:02:02.707
So, even if some weird hypothesis is
looking good as long as the real one

00:02:02.707 --> 00:02:05.421
eventually becomes better,
it'll come back to it and

00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:07.400
that's what its showing here.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.287
But basically, the idea is you can use
the similarity function of the two color

00:02:12.287 --> 00:02:16.000
distributions as your sensor model for
a particle filter.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.469
And this relates to this idea
of what I said before that,

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.583
particle filters really
are pretty flexible.

00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:24.370
You can pull out whatever sensor model
you want to use as long as you can put

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.480
it within this Bayesian
framework of p of z, given x.
