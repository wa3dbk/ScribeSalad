00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.440
So here is a giant model of our phone, and

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.420
our button is placed somewhere over here.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.570
What we really want to do

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.560
is center line this button both vertically and horizontally.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.590
Now, the way to figure out how to do this is by reading documentation.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.840
So here is your opportunity to practice.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.690
How would you go about making sure this button

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.950
is centered vertically and horizontally?

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.850
See if you can figure it out.
