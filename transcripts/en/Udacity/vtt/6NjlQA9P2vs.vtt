00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.932
Back at the beginning of the course, we worked a lot with exponents. So, if you

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:08.718
remember that well, then great. But if not, let's look at a certain pattern. We

00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:13.158
know that 2 to the 2nd power is four, and we know that 2 to the 1st power is 2,

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:19.459
2 to the 0 is 1. So, every time we decrease our exponent by 1, we're halving

00:00:19.459 --> 00:00:24.527
the numbers over here. So, if we need to halve 1, to get 1 half, which is what

00:00:24.527 --> 00:00:30.235
we're looking for, then we need to decrease this exponent one more time. So

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:34.801
that means that 1 half should be equal to 2 to the negative 1. That means we

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:40.272
can write log base 2 of 1 half as log base 2 of 2 to the negative 1. That just

00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:41.373
gives us negative 1.
