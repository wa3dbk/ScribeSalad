00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's be a little bit more precise about what the rules are and what it means

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to play a word within a row and how that hooks up to the other columns.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, the rules say that at least one letter that you play has to be adjacent

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to an existing letter on the board. We'll mark with red asterisks such squares.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We call these anchor squares. These are the squares that we can start from.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Then we build out in each direction, forming consecutive letters into a single word.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, the anchor squares do have to be adjacent to an existing letter,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but they don't have to be adjacent all within a row.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
They can be adjacent in either direction.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Let's expand the board beyond a single row and let's populate this with some more letters.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Imagine that this board goes on in both directions.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There's probably an E here or something like that.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If we restrict our attention just to this row, notice that we've now introduced a new anchor point.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This square is adjacent to an existing letter, and so that also counts as an anchor.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now we want to find a word, which consists of a prefix plus a suffix.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We get to define the game.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We can say that for every anchor point, the prefix is going to be zero or more letters

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to the left of the anchor point, not counting the anchor point itself.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Then the suffix will be the anchor point and everything to the right.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Of course, we have to arrange so that prefix plus suffix together form a word

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
which is in the dictionary.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now here's a cool play that comes from the dictionary.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
BACKBENCH is a word, and note that if we just have this rule

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
of word equals prefix plus suffix where the suffix has to start with an anchor,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
then there'd be four possible ways of specifying this one move.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We could anchor it here with no suffix.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We could anchor it here with these three letters as a suffix.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We could anchor it here with these letters as a suffix.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Or we could anchor it here with all these as a suffix and just H as the prefix.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Now, it seems wasteful to degenerate the same result four times,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
so we can arbitrarily and without loss of completeness make up a rule which says

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
there's no anchor within a prefix.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We couldn't use this as a the anchor, because then there'd be anchors within the prefix.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Likewise, we couldn’t use this one or this one.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We can only use this one as the prefix in order to generate this particular word.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The anchor will also come from the hand,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and the suffix can be a mix of hand and board.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Here, this is the anchor.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The prefix is empty. The anchor letter comes from the hand.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Then there's a mix of letters for the rest of the word.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Now, what are the rules for a prefix. Let's summarize.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
A prefix is zero or more characters, can't cover up an anchor square,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and they can only cover empty squares.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
For example, for this anchor square here, the prefix can go backward,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but it can't cover this anchor.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So the possible lengths for this prefix are zero to two characters.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Any prefix can be zero characters, and here there's room for two,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
but there's not room for three, because then it would cover up an anchor.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
In that case, all the letters in the prefix come from the hand, but consider this anchor.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
For this anchor, we're required to take these two letters as part of the prefix,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
because we can't go without them because this abuts.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
These two must be part of the prefix,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and this one can't be part of the prefix because it's an anchor.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If we wanted that we generate it from this anchor, rather than from this one.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
That means the length of a prefix for this anchor has to be exactly two.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Similarly, the length of the prefix for this anchor has to be exactly one,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
has to include this character, because if we place a letter here, this is adjacent--

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
it's got to be part of the word--and this is an anchor so we can't cover it.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So we see that a prefix either the letters come all from the hand o

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
or they come all from the board.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
What I want you to do is for the remaining anchors here, tell me what the possible lengths are.

00:04:02.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Either put a single number like this or a range of numbers--number-number.
