00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.485
In the last lesson, an advertising agent told Grant that with her company's

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:08.925
help, he can make at least $5,000 in two weeks. We said initially, that this

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:13.506
meant that after two weeks, Grant's profit would be equal to $5,000. We dealt

00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:18.020
with a lot of equations in this course so far just like this one, but is this

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.352
the best tool to use in this situation? As I see it, we have three options. We

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:26.845
can either stick with describing this as profit equals 5000. We can come up with

00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:31.269
some other mathematical statement that would fit this situation better. Or we

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.709
could just decide not to do any more math ever again. Pick which one you think

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:36.835
is the best option.
