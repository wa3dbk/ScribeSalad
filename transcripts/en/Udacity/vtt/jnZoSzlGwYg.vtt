00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.365
Just as we did when factoring trinomials, we want to factor out any greatest

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:08.676
common factor before solving an equation. After we factor, we want to set each

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:13.115
factor equal to zero, including our greatest common factor. For example, if we

00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:17.145
wanted to solve this equation, we'd want to remove a greatest common factor

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:21.106
first. Do you see it? And it turns out that this equation will have three

00:00:21.106 --> 00:00:26.007
solutions. And you might be wondering why. Well, the highest power here is a

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:30.165
three, and this highest power on the variable tells us how many solutions we'll

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:34.879
have for an equation. So, since we have z cubed or z to the third, we'll have

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.343
three solutions. So, what would be the answers here? What could z equal?
