00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.126
Let's sum this up. The surface color is then computed with the emissive

00:00:04.126 --> 00:00:08.151
component, plus the ambient component, those are both solid colors. And then for

00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:12.105
each light, there's a diffuse component which depends on the light's direction

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:15.999
and the specular component which depends on the light's direction and the view

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.810
direction. If you haven't seen it before, this Greek letter sigma is the

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.560
summation sign. It means to sum up all the diffuse and specular contributions

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.349
for each light. Putting math in any lecture is often considered the kiss of

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.572
death. The good news is that you can mostly ignore this equation here. It's just

00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:35.544
another way of showing all this previous text. I put this math notation here

00:00:35.544 --> 00:00:38.706
mostly because you'll run across this summation term a lot when looking at

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:42.688
material reflection models. The emissive and ambient terms are pretty simple. So

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:46.592
our focus for the rest of this unit will be in looking at the diffuse and the

00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:47.983
specular terms in depth.
