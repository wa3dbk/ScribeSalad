00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.772
We know that there are going to be N source elements,

00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:05.428
and we're going to have the same N destination elements.

00:00:05.428 --> 00:00:09.016
So for any particular source element, say X here,

00:00:09.016 --> 00:00:15.425
we must fetch that source element for each individual computation for every destination element,

00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:17.721
and for a particular destination element,

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:22.627
we know that we have to fetch the parameters for each individual source element.

00:00:22.627 --> 00:00:27.478
So overall we have to fetch each element N times as the source and N times as the destination,

00:00:27.478 --> 00:00:31.574
or if we assume that an object does not exert any force on itself,

00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:34.879
then we'd fetch each element N minus 1 for each of the source or destination.

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.125
The answer should be either 2N or 2N minus 2 times; This is quite expensive.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:44.681
We'd really like to organize the computation in such a way that we consume less global memory bandwidth,

00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:48.318
and we're going to try to do this by storing and reusing some of these memory fetches,

00:00:48.318 --> 00:00:51.605
and in particular, we'd like to be able to take advantage of the GPU's ability

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:54.487
to share data between neighboring threads.
