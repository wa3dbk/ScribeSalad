00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.342
Here are the two solutions. Great work if you found both of those. First, we

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:08.768
split up each of these numbers into two factors. We want to make sure that one

00:00:08.768 --> 00:00:13.506
of the factors is the largest square number that divides into it. For the first

00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:16.586
one, we know the square root of 16 equals 4, and then we're left with

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:21.123
multiplying by the square root of 3y. We take the square root of 4 to you get 2

00:00:21.123 --> 00:00:24.790
times the square root of 3y. And we take the square root of 9 to get 3 times

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.840
the square root of y. Be sure you keep the signs the same as you work. Now we

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.478
have like terms, since each one has a square root of 3y. We add 4 and 2, and

00:00:34.478 --> 00:00:39.776
subtract 3 to get 3 times the square root of 3y. For the second problem, we

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:45.770
start by splitting up 8 into 4 times 2. And we split up 32 into 16 times 2. For

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.390
our numbers, we take the square root of 4 which equals 2. And this 2 stays

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.320
inside of our square root since it doesn't appear twice as a factor. For the

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.720
variables, we want to remember power divided by root. We take the power of 2

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.300
and divide it by 2 to get 1. This means x to the 1 appears outside of our

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.944
radical. For y, we'll do 3 divided by 2 because our index is a 2 here. We know

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:14.938
3 divided by an index of 2 equals 1 remainder 1. This means one y comes out,

00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:19.640
and one y stays in. We saw this before when we're simplifying roots earlier. We

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.215
used power divided by root, and this number indicates the power outside of the

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:28.148
radical where the remainder indicates the power inside the radical. For our

00:01:28.148 --> 00:01:32.807
second radical, we take the square root of 16, which equals 4. The 2 stays

00:01:32.807 --> 00:01:37.480
inside of the square root and now we need to simplify y to the 3rd power. We

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.273
use power divided by root, so 3 divided by 2 equals 1 remainder 1. So, we have

00:01:43.273 --> 00:01:48.540
one y on the outside and one y on the inside. We multiply the numbers together

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.590
infront of each radical to get 6xy times square root of 2y minus 8xy times the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.942
square root of 2y. Now, we subtract these two radicals. We use 6xy minus 8xy to

00:01:58.942 --> 00:02:05.930
get negative 2xy times the square root of 2y, our final result. Keep in mind

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.479
that there are two reasons why we could subtract here. We subtracted because

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.241
the radicals were alike and we subtracted because these polynomials were like

00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:17.903
terms. We're really packing on the algebra now.
