00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.682
I implemented the solution by creating an object in which to put my cylinder and

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:07.076
two spheres. At the top there's a little logic here to determine whether any

00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:11.139
sphere is needed at all. If so, I create the sphere's geometry. Then, each end

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.566
is checked to see if it's used. If it is, a sphere object is created with the

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:18.332
geometry, positioned and added to the capsule, which is then returned. That's

00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:18.509
it.
