00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.310
So, here we are in the Jenkins console.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.900
Even without logging in, we can look at
various projects that it's been set up

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.140
to build, like adventure.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.780
This project is watching a GitHub
repo for another Udacity course, and

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.070
every time a student checks in,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.920
in addition to that repo,
this Jenkins instance recompiles it.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.250
You can see the history of it
over here under build history.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.650
Now, if we go back to the main page, and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.110
login, then we'll be able to
access the server wide settings.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.060
For instance,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.439
here are the security settings that let
us say what users are allowed to do.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.780
And over here is the list of plugins.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.420
Jenkins is kind of
a plugin based system.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.110
Everything you want to do,
such as pull from GitHub or

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.600
run JUnit tests or various other
things is there on a plugin.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.910
Now that we're logged in,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.440
let's take another look at
that adventure build target.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.640
Under the project configuration,
you can see the name,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.430
there can be a description, here's
what repository it's gotten from with

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.170
a GitHub URL here, and
down here is the build schedule.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.395
It says how often the build can be
run if Jenkins notices changes.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:07.020
H/15 in this field means that it
should be run every 15 minutes.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.330
And down here you can see the build
script that's actually being run.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.150
Turns out that this is just a mockup.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.490
And it runs the disk usage,
or du Unix command.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.910
If this were a real build it would
probably run compilation and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.420
packaging here.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.320
And then if we look in
an individual build

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.160
at the console output we can
see the output of that script.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.072
Having this kind of log from every
compilation is really handy.

00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:35.160
Suppose that something had
gone wrong ten builds ago,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.830
would you rather be diagnosing
that from someone's email saying,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.330
something broke and I don't know what?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.890
Or from a log file,
that says exactly what's going on?
