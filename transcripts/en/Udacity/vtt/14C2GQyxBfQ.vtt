00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.230
Let's take a look at how IP address

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.510
space is allocated to Internet service providers. At

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.109
the top of the hierarchy is an organization

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.450
called the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, or IANA. IANA

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.800
has the authority to allocate address space to

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.280
what are called regional routing registries. For Africa, the

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.780
regional registry is called AFRINIC. For Asia and

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.520
Australia, the registry is called APNIC. For North America,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.700
ARIN. For Latin America, it's LACNIC. And for

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.750
Europe, it's RIPE. ARIN in turn allocates address space

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.230
to individual networks, like Georgia Tech. The address space

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.700
across registries is far from even. Now, this graph

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.220
is from a journal article that's a little

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.180
bit dated now, but it gives you an idea

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.330
of how many /8 address allocations have been allocated

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.620
to each of the regional registries. So as of

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.540
2005, North America had 23/8s allocated to it,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.020
but the entire continent of Africa had only one.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.640
And the recent news is that IANA actually finished

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.209
allocating all remaining /8 Internet address blocks, essentially meaning

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.060
that we're out of IPv4 address space. So

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.540
when you hear that we're out of IPv4 addresses,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.250
it doesn't mean that you can no longer attach

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.780
a new device to the Internet. There are various

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.060
ways for coping with this pressure on address

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.340
space. What that means is that IANA no

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.080
longer has any more /8 blocks to give

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.320
to these regional registries. Querying an IP address

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.090
using Whois and a routing registry, such as

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.280
ra.net, will tell you the owner of that

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.630
particular prefix. For example, if we run a

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.890
Whois query on an IP address at Georgia Tech,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.110
it will tell us that that IP address is from a /16 allocation. That

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.666
Georgia Tech is the owner of the prefix and it's associated with this autonomous

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:51.470
system number. The routing registry entry also

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.280
gives us some additional information, such as

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.700
who to contact if we need to contact the owner of this address space.
