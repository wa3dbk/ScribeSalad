00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.380
The notion of orthogonality
is extremely powerful.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.150
Fundamentally, it gives us a tool for

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.040
decomposing objects into combinations
of simpler objects in a structured way.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.750
Let's explore one of the first phenomena
that are consequences of orthogonality.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.440
For this video,
let b be a constant vector.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.250
Or you can think of the b as
standing for the word basis.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.150
It will be useful to think of b as
emanating from the origin and then to

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.780
imagine a line l through the origin
that contains the arrow representing b.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.200
We're going to consider the process
of projecting a vector v

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.390
onto the basis vector b.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.270
One way to describe what this means is
to let v emanate from the origin and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.530
then imagine rotating your point of
view until you are looking at b and

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.850
v in the same plane.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.810
Then measure the apparent magnitude of
the arrow v from this point of view.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.515
Unless v and b are perfectly parallel,
v will look shorter than it actually is.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:04.450
The shorter arrow is
the projection of v onto b

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.560
which we will denote by proj sub b of v.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.930
Or v with two little bars next to it for
short.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.890
Another way to describe projection
is to draw a right triangle

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.860
whose hypotenuse is
the arrow depicting v.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.500
And one of whose legs
lies on the line l.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.170
If we draw a vector from
the origin along this leg,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.150
that drawn vector will also be
the projection of v onto b.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.570
The remaining leg is
perpendicular to the line l,

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.870
and therefore orthogonal to b.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.670
If we draw a vector along this leg,
the drawn vector is the component of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.440
the orthogonal to b which we can denote
v with a an upside down t called v perp.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.520
Remember a definition of
the sum of two vectors?

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.090
Since we have formed a chain of two
arrows from the tail to the head of v,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.740
we can say that the sum of
these two vectors is v.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.800
In other words,
v equals the parallel plus the perp.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.010
We have written v as a sum of two
vectors, one that is parallel to b and

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.610
the other that is orthogonal to b.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.590
This is something that
occurs often in mathematics.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.950
Given a nonzero basis vector
we can express any vector

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.400
as a sum of two vectors, one that's
parallel to the basis vector and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.400
one that is orthogonal
to the basis vectors.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.320
All right, so

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.330
is there a nice way to compute the
projection of v onto the basis vector b?

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.950
Let's start by making
a simplifying assumption.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.120
Let's assume that the angle between
v and b is at most 90 degrees.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.810
If you remember soh-CAH-toa from
trigonometry remember that the CAH means

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.310
that the cos sign of the angle of
a right triangle is equal to the ratio

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.310
of the adjacent edge to the angle and
the hypotenuse.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.680
In other words, the cosine of
theater is equal to the length of

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.270
v parallel divided by the length of v.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.970
After some rearranging, that means
that the length of the v parallel

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.360
is the length of v times
the cosine of theta.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.990
Now we're going to use our dot
product formula from earlier.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.940
Substituting this expression in for
cosine theta we get that the length

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.600
of v parallel equals the length
of v times this expression.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.880
Since we have a factor of the length
of v in the numerator and

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.090
denominator of the expression,
we can cancel them.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.250
And then we can rewrite what's left
over as v.u sub b whereas u sub b

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.387
is the unit vector in the direction
of b i.e., the normalization.

00:03:45.387 --> 00:03:48.580
All right, so
I cleaned up some of these formulas and

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.560
just left what we need going
forward the length of v parallel

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.290
is equal to the dot product of just
v with the normalization of b.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.010
Now because we made this simplifying
assumption that theta is less than or

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.600
equal to 90 degrees we know that v

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.590
parallel will point in
the same direction as b.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.950
We also know that the normalization
of b is a unit vector.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.140
So it will have magnitude one.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.310
What these two facts tell us is that
if we scale the normalization of b by

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.300
exactly the length of v parallel there
will actually get the vector v parallel.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.030
imagine taking a unit vector that's
right here and just stretching it

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.310
just the amount needed to get to v
parallel that's what we're doing.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.380
Now let's plug in this expression for
the length of the parallel.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.405
And what we end up with is this formula.

00:04:43.405 --> 00:04:46.870
V parallel is exactly
the normalization of b

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.330
times the scalar v dot
the normalization of b.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.750
Now what if we didn't make
the simplifying assumption?

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.350
What if theta were
greater than 90 degrees?

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.690
That negative sign from earlier will
carry through all the way to this

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.545
expression here.

00:05:01.545 --> 00:05:04.360
We'll also have to make a change here

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.050
because v parallel will now point
in the opposite direction of b.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.320
Since v parallel is pointing in the
opposite direction this formula will now

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.300
become a negative but
now when we plug this expression in for

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.890
a length of v parallel then
the negative signs will cancel out and

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.610
we'll get the same formula.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.270
So regardless of the assumptions that
we make on this angle will always get

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.410
the same formula for v parallel in other
words the projection of v on to b.
