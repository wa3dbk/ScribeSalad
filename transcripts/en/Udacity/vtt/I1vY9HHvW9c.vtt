00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.890
So, what's really great about Pig is that it abstracts

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.450
away from the user the actual implementation of how the

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.610
calculation is done. So, you can write in a more

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.070
abstract language what kinds of operations should be performed to

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.730
your data. You can say, for example, join this data

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.980
set to this data set, or filter out this data

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.470
set, or reduce this data. But you're not telling it

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.930
how to do the analysis. And then Pig can decide

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.300
the fastest way to do it for you. So instead of having to write

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.600
very detailed jobs describing exactly what should

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.310
be done, you can just specify in an

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.630
abstract sense the calculation that needs to be done, and you can let the

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.550
computer do the hard work of figuring out the faster way to do the calculation.
