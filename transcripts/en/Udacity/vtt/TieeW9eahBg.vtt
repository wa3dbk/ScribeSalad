00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.229
The domain of this function is all the real numbers, which we write in interval

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:08.822
notation as spanning from negative infinity to positive infinity. Now, there are

00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:13.514
no domain restrictions on this function imposed by the math itself because every

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:17.723
value of x that we could plug in from all the real numbers, is going to cause

00:00:17.723 --> 00:00:21.960
the function to spit out a real value of y as well. So, what is its range?

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.370
Another good question. Well, we can see from the graph, that as x decreases, y

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.204
is continuing to decrease as well. And as x increases, y is continuing to

00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:35.667
increase. If we look at the function, the higher the value of x that we plug in,

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:40.346
the higher and higher and higher, y is going to go. And similarly, the lower the

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:45.086
x value we input, the smaller this number over here is going to get for the

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:51.750
output. So, the range is also all the real numbers.
