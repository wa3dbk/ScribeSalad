00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.086
The brute force answer would be to copy and paste the reflection equation and

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:07.169
substitute in the normals, making sure to divide each contribution by two. I'm

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.338
hoping you used a loop. The overall coding change with a loop is to take the

00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:14.050
two jiggled normals and use them in the shading equation. Each iteration is

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.270
multiplied by a half so that the total contribution is the same.
