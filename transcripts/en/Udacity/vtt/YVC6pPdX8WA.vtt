00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.950
We just calculated that the exact length of segment BC was the square root of

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:11.560
180. But there's actually a different way that we can write this. What if I

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:17.280
remind you that 180 is actually equal to 36 times 5? So, the square root of 180

00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:22.915
is equal to the square root of the quantity 36 times 5. We also know, though,

00:00:23.037 --> 00:00:28.314
that 36 is the same as 6 squared. Taking this into account, can you think of a

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:32.923
different way to write the length of BC, so that there's one number under a

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:37.965
radical sign and another number multiplied by that that's not under the radical

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:38.473
anymore?
