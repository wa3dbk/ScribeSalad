00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.870
Imagine that your valuation set has just
six examples with an accuracy of 66%.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.150
Now you tweak your model and

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:14.520
your performance goes from 66% to 83%,
is this something you can trust?

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.020
No of course, this is only a change
of label for a single example.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.850
It could just be noise.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.710
The bigger you test set, the less noisy
the accuracy measurement will be.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.150
Here is a useful rule of thumb.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.880
And if you're a statistician,
feel free to cover your ears right now.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.110
A change that affects 30 examples in
your validation set, one way or another,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.360
is usually statistically significant,
and typically can be trusted.
