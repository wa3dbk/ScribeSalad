00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.490
So now that we have
a functioning Flask application,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.220
let's bring our CRUD
functionality into it.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.720
I will import the code for
SQLAlchemy and

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.130
the database engine in sessionmaker
like in Lessons 1 and 2.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.780
Now I'm going to change my
HelloWorld function such that it

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.720
performs this following query to grab
the first restaurant out of my database.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.578
And list out all of the menu items and
stored in a string called output.

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:23.670
I'll also add a break line tag to
make my output a bit easier to read.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.690
I will return this output string so
that my user sees it from the browser.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.720
When I save my Python file my flask
server instantly refreshes itself.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.840
So when I refresh the page I now
see all of my menu items listed
