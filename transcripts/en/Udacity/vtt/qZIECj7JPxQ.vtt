00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.870
We've arrived at the final tool for
this course, the debug view hierarchy.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.630
This was recently added to Xcode, and
it allows us to dig in to the visual

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.130
hierarchy of an app
while we're debugging.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.536
So to make things interesting,
let's run the application, and

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:18.030
I'm going to create a couple spiders.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.230
[SOUND] There we go.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.551
And let's set a breakpoint in the add
bug to view, and jump back and

00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:30.980
drop into our breakpoint.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.600
From here, there are two ways to
access the debug view hierarchy.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.110
The first is in the debug navigator, and

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.280
we get to it by going to
the debug navigator, and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.240
then selecting this UI hierarchy from
the dropdown, from this icon here.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.810
So we'll select it.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.895
And if we look at this unfolded list,
we can see all the different UI

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:57.360
image views, debugs,
essentially that are being created.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.640
And we can see where they're located.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.600
If we click on one of the items in the
list, this is where it gets interesting.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.890
It brings us to this visual
display of our view.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.390
So as I'm selecting on these,
these are debugs that I click on.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.970
This.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.580
It's talking about
the buttons that we have.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.750
And there are debugs.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.350
Now if we click and drag this area,
this is really cool.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.830
It explodes into a three dimensional
view of our view hierarchy.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.150
And we can see visually now.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.570
Some of the relationships between
different elements in the view.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.190
Just like the list, we can select
the different components, so

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.620
I'll select this one.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.360
That's the UI Navigation
Transition View.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.250
Select that one.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.840
Let me zoom out just a tad.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.340
There we go.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.800
That's one of the UI image views.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.480
There's a UI image view.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.290
That's the UI navigation bar background,
and so on.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.300
Now let's go over to the controls
that are available to us.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.790
Dragging this bar in the lower left hand
corner, will allow us to increase and

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.560
decrease the spacing between
the components in the hierarchy.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.360
The next two buttons can toggle,
showing clipped contents, and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.160
constraints, which does not do much for
us here.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.000
Let's just leave it as is.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.400
And, the third button from the left,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.350
can flatten the view back into
its two dimensional form.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.720
Next are the viewing modes which include
contents, wireframes, and wireframes and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.060
contents.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.790
And let's just leave it as wireframe and
contents for now.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.720
After that, we have these minus and
plus icons which are for zooming.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.280
And then if we click the equal
sign it will just zoom, so

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.920
that maximizes your view based on
the space that's available to you.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.970
Now this last control.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.760
What it does is, it adjust the views
that are visible from you going from

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.630
the bottom most views on the left,
to the top most views on the right.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.260
So, if I start by dragging from
the right, and moving left, you should

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.970
see the things on the top disappear,
before the things on the bottom do.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.280
And, hold up.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.520
Let me zoom out.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.020
There we go.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.874
And let me tilt it a little bit.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.540
And those are all the controls
that we have on the bottom.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.960
The next thing that we can do in the
debug view hierarchy, is get diagnostic

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.650
information about the components
we've selected in the utility area.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.410
So you'll want to click
one of the components.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.830
And then to display the utility area,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.350
make sure that you've
toggled on this icon here.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.280
There we go.
And here you can see information

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.710
about the component's type.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.000
UI image view, it's raw address.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.650
Some state information.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.080
And a display showing its content.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.590
The raw address, hint,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.300
hint, can be casted like we did
earlier in the command line interface,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.360
to gather more information
about the component itself.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.470
So you can see how this would be
incredibly useful, especially for

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.370
games and other applications.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.170
A lot of things going in and
out of the view.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.690
This is a really cool way
to debug our application.
