00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.926
And I'd prefer number 2. Any of these could be correct, especially depending on

00:00:03.926 --> 00:00:06.960
how close you live to a beach and how nice the weather is today, but I'm going

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.583
to suggest that we do number 2. And the reason that we do number 2, rather than,

00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:14.416
refining next day, is I like to procrastinate. The grungy work of dealing with

00:00:14.416 --> 00:00:18.126
all the complexity of real months. Let's put that off till later. The advantage

00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:21.722
of doing 2 first is we'll have a lot of confidence we're on the right track if

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:25.090
this works. We'll be very close. We'll be getting approximate answers. We'll see

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.372
that we're on the right track. And then, we can figure out those details but we

00:00:28.372 --> 00:00:32.162
won't need to change this code later. So, let's go ahead and see if we can write

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:35.974
days between dates using the next day procedure. We won't get exact answers that

00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:39.429
are correct here because our next day procedure is not quite correct.
