00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.952
To calculate Pearson's R in the Google spreadsheet, we write: Equals PEARSON

00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:09.892
parentheses, then here we'll have the start cell for variable x, colon, so all

00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:14.680
the way to, the end cell for variable x, comma, start cell for variable y, all

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:24.082
the way to the end cell for variable y, close parentheses. About 60 of you took

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:28.996
the poll that I distributed when I announced lesson 12. There were some

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:32.985
interesting results. All the data is below, and there are two pairs of

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:36.885
variables that I want to focus on: Age, and when you arrive at a party, and

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:42.470
Age, and of number of pets. The first thing I want you to do is, visualize the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.950
data. Create a scatter plot for each. Does it look like there's a relationship,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.323
between age and when you arrive at a party? Or between age and number of pets?
