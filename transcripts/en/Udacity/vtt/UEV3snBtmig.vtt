00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.620
A property in Acme is nothing more than i, than an identifier that can be

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.590
associated with a value. That is, you're giving name value pairs that are then

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.660
become part of the syntax syntactic description of your architecture.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.250
Examples of uses of such name value-pairs include. Visualization properties,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.360
that is, if you are not satisfied with what Acme Studio gives you,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.870
but you have other tools available to visualize architectures,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.150
you might wish to communicate information about those additional properties

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.690
within an Acme description. Temporal constraints. Archi, architectures describe

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.300
systems that actually run and may have timing considerations with them, and

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.730
you may wish to use tools that can take advantage of this,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.810
such as simulator tools. You might like to have more detailed checking,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.250
on the data being communicated via the ports and roles, and so you might have

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.590
a type checking tool. The particular communications between the components

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.670
across the connectors to other components, constitutes a protocol. And

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.730
you might wish to enforce that protocol. Do checking on that protocol, and

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.590
so on. And hence you could use the property language to describe the protocol.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.210
If there's scheduling constraints you could put those in.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.580
If there's resource consumptions constraints you can put those in, and so on.
