00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.600
So their answer is both of the last two. Both of

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.350
these will need to go through the loop here, the number of

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.360
elements in index times. In the case where it's a word that's

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.990
not in a index, the test will always be false, and will

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.350
get to the end of the loop and return none. In

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.642
the case where the last word is added, we'll still go through

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:21.810
the loop, the number of elements times, but the very last time

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.470
we'll find a match, and return that element. One of the assumptions

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.300
in all of this analysis is that the time it

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.950
takes to go through the loop doesn't depend on the actual

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.960
keyword that's passed in. And that's assuming that this equal

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.000
comparison takes the same amount of time depending on what the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.830
entry and the keyword is. That it doesn't matter what

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.190
the keyword is the time to do this comparison is the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.370
same. And it turns out that for strings and Python that's

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.110
the case. That we can do these string comparisons very quickly,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.420
because strings are immutable. That means that we don't need to look

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.180
at all the characters in the string to compare two strings. That

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.370
double equal for strings can be done in such a way that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.660
it doesn't need to look at the whole string. It knows that the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.850
strings were created as different strings.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.349
That means they're different strings. Or

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.760
if they were created as the same string, they're the same string. So

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.750
that's the reason why we say that all of the other operations

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.330
in the loop have constant time. That they don't depend on the size

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.840
of inputs at all. These are all very fast operations. What

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.770
matters in terms of understanding the time is the number of times

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.860
we go through that index. If you take the follow on course,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.290
which I hope you will, we'll understand how to analyze algorithms in

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.120
a more formal way. For now our goal is to develop

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.640
an intuition, and for that intuition the important thing to understand is

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.310
the running time depends on the number of times we go through

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.520
this loop. Everything that we do inside the loop is constant time.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.890
It's not affected by the size of the elements.
