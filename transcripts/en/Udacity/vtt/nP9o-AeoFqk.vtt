00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.560
Here's the data. Let's calculate Pearson's r anywhere in the white space.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:14.060
Equals Pearson, and we need to enter the x values. A 2 colon a 10. And then we

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.930
need to enter the y values, b 2 colon b 10. We get that Pearson's r if we round

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.303
to two decimal places, it's 0.91.
