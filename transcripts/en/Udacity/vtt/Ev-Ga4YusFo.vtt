00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.444
There're three things we have to do. First off, we need to declare an instance

00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:07.455
variable to hold the choices. That's an ArrayList of Strings. In the

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:12.570
constructor, I initialized it with an empty ArrayList. And in the add-choice

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.230
method, I simply add the choice to the ArrayList. That was a good start, but so

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.530
far we've ignored this parameter that tells us whether that choice was correct

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.900
or not. And that's what we're going to be doing in the next stage.
