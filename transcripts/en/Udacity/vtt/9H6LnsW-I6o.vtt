00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.827
Now let's state the general rule for
creating all the transition clauses.

00:00:03.827 --> 00:00:09.146
Recall that a tuple k, l,
k prime, l prime, delta, is valid,

00:00:09.146 --> 00:00:14.663
if switching to state qk prime,
writing out the symbol sl prime and

00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:17.914
moving into action delta is an option,

00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:23.745
given that the machine is currently
in state qk and reading symbol sl.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:28.075
For every step I, position j, and

00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:34.220
invalid transition, k, l,
k prime, l prime, delta,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.830
we include in the formula a clause like
this, the first part tests whether

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.210
the truth assignment is such that
the transition rule actually applies.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.030
And the next three rules ensures that
this invalid transition wasn't followed.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.540
This is just the generalization of
the example that we saw earlier.
