00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.117
As we go ahead and start applying rules of inferences to sentences in

00:00:04.117 --> 00:00:08.354
a knowledge base. We'll find it convenient to rewrite the sentences in

00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:13.280
a knowledge base. And sometimes it will be very useful to rewrite these

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.170
sentences in the knowledge base in a manner that eliminates the implications in

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.690
a sentence. And this is how we can eliminate the implication. If a implies b,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.940
than we can rewrite it as not a or b. We know this because the truth

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.090
value of a implies b is exactly the same as your truth value of not a or

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.740
b. We can take an example here. Supposing that we are given feathers imply bird.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.670
Then we can rewrite this as not feathers or bird. And intuitively,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.760
you can see the truth value of this. It is either the animal does not have

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.610
feathers or, it is a bird. In a little bit, we will see that this is

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.370
a important rewrite rule in doing certain kinds of logical proofs.
