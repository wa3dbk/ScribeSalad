This one's a compile time error. Let's see how this works in BlueJ. I'll make a

00:00:06.394 --> 00:00:12.725
program and I'll put this line into it. Now I compile it and it says, cannot

00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:18.195
find symbol, variable Hello. What do you think went wrong here? You can pause

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:21.567
the video and try and think about it for a second if you want. How would you

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:26.592
fix this error? The computer doesn't know what we mean by hello. And what we

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:31.127
wanted was hello Sarah to be literal text. In order to do that we need the

00:00:31.127 --> 00:00:38.109
quatation marks. Let's see if it works now. Okay. Now there are no compile-time

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:43.439
errors. Let's try running it. Oops. It spelled my name wrong. There's no h in

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:48.985
my name. This would be considered a run-time error. This is a logic error, not

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:50.479
a syntax error.
