00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.200
What do you think about this David?

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.180
&gt;&gt; So starting with Roomba,
I would put Roomba in the bottom left.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.939
It definitely acts in the world.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:08.540
But it definitely doesn't act like I do.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.680
It crisscrosses across the floor
until it vacuums everything up.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.535
So we're going to say
that's acting optimally.

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:17.720
C-3PO is fluent in over 6
million forms of communication.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.790
And that means that it interacts with
human and other species very often.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.870
In order to do that, it has to
understand natural sentences and

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.330
put its own knowledge back
into natural sentences.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.120
So, it has to act like humans.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.090
Apple's virtual assistant,
Siri, doesn't act in the world.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.530
So she is more on the thinking
end of the spectrum but,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.270
like C-3PO,
she has to interact with humans.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.720
She has to read human sentences and

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.230
she has to put her own responses
back into normal vernacular.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.480
So we're going to say that
she thinks like humans.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.140
Google Maps plots your route from
your origin to your destination.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.510
So it's definitely doing thinking,
it's not doing any acting in the world.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.340
But we don't really care if it does
the route planning like we would do it.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.520
So we would say it does its
route planning optimally.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.480
It takes into consideration traffic.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.584
Current construction,
different things like that,

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:06.920
where we would probably think of
the routes we have taken in the past.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.650
So Google Maps thinks optimally.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.880
&gt;&gt; That is a good answer David,
I agree with you, but not here that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.120
some aspects of Siri, may well belong
in some of the other quadrants.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.080
So, putting under 3 sounds plausible.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.100
But Siri might also be viewed as,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.400
perhaps, acting when it
gives you a response.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.550
Siri, some aspects of Siri might also be
optimal, not necessarily like humans.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.970
&gt;&gt; So if you'd like to discuss where
these technologies belong on these

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.190
spectrums or, perhaps, discuss where
some other AI technologies that you're

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.780
familiar with belong on these spectrums,
feel free to head on over to our forums

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.780
where you can bring up your own
technologies and discuss the different.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.280
Ways in which they fit into
the broader school of AI.
