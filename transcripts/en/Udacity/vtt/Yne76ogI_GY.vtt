00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, we have looked at individual developers and past bugs,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
at complexity, at tests, at team structure, and at the problem domain.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Developers get assigned to tasks that are hard in the first place,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and tasks that are hard call for more bugs.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That is, also more past bugs.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Also, more testing.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
All of this leads us to the domain as being the most important factor

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in determining where bugs actually come from.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If the domain changes frequently, this will lead to more bugs.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If the domain is complex in itself, such as JavaScript or in eclipse the compiler,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
this will lead to more bugs.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If the domain is not well-defined--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
for instance, because the team cannot agree on what to do--

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
then this also calls for more bugs.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What we can do, though, is by looking at past bugs,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
identify which parts of the domain and possibly other influences

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
correlate with past bugs.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This may give us a handle on how to avoid such mistakes in the future.
