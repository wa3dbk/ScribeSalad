00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.240
One solution to the shortest
path problem for

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.689
weighted undirected graphs is
called Dijkstra's Algorithm.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.640
Let's say we're trying to find
the shortest path from here to here.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.760
We begin by giving all
vertices a distance value.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.710
A distance is the sum of edge weights on
a path between our starting point and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.930
whatever vertex we're on.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.750
At the end of the algorithm,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.360
this distance will be the distance
of the shortest path.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.820
The distance value we
start with is infinity.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.980
This is a placeholder value that will
update whenever we discover a node and

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.669
have an actual distance to store.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.180
The node we're starting with
will have a distance of zero.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.610
A common implementation of Dijkstra's
uses a min priority queue,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.540
where the element with
a minimum priority, or

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.820
minimum distance in our case,
can be removed efficiently.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.910
We store all of our nodes in
the priority queue and use extract min

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.890
to take out the minimum element,
the only one with a distance of zero.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.750
&gt;From our starting node
we have several options.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.330
We will follow each edge and
update the node on the other side with

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.935
a distance value,
which is just the weight of the edge.

00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:17.955
Now we are faced with a choice.

00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:19.195
Which node should we visit?

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:23.625
We'll always pick the node with
the smallest distance value,

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.955
which means we run
extract min on the queue.

00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:30.265
Because we always pick the node
with the lowest distance,

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:32.725
Dijkstra's is often called
a greedy algorithm.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.980
The philosophy for
this class of algorithms is

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.590
pick whatever option looks best at
the moment, hence the name greedy.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.520
We repeat the process visiting all
adjacent nodes that are still in

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.640
the queue and updating their distance
values if we can decrease it at all.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.700
We keep going, extracting
the minimum from our queue and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.820
exploring adjacent elements, until
the node we're looking for has been

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.160
extracted from the queue or everything
else has a distance of infinity.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.600
Which means the path we're looking for
doesn't exist.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.560
The basic runtime of Dijkstra's is
the number of vertices squared.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.429
Since in the worst case, we visit every
node in the graph once or twice and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.190
every time we visit we need to
search through the queue to find

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.930
the minimum element.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.712
There are a lot of optimizations for
Dijkstra's, if the priority queue is

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:29.497
implemented really efficiently,
the runtime looks more like this.
