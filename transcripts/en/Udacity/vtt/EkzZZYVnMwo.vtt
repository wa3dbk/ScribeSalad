00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.165
let's try it out. Here is our average program. If we just enter q immediately

00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:08.604
then it tells us NaN but what does NaN mean? let's ask everybody on the

00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:12.444
Internet. let's search for java NaN. Looks like other people have had this

00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:17.876
question before and under the answers it says NaN stands for not a number. It's

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:21.494
produced if some floating point operation has some input parameters that cause

00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:26.730
the operation to produce some undefined result. For example, 0 divided by 0 is

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.076
arethmatically undefined. So we must have done some kind of math that was

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:35.514
undefined. It seems like the most complicated piece of math we're doing here is

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:39.334
just this division. So let's print out what sum and count are. Here's a print

00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:44.655
line statement from sum and count. And now, if I enter q immediately, it tells

00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:49.990
me that sum and count are both 0. So it makes sense that I'm getting NaN; I'm

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.283
dividing by 0.
