00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.509
Starting out by distributing means that we want to distribute the multiplication

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:08.766
by 3 to both terms inside the parentheses on the left side. So we end up with 3x

00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:13.181
plus 3 times 2 or 6. Since simplifying on the left side of the equation doesn't

00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:17.460
involve the right side of the equation at all, we don't change anything about

00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:21.712
this 12 minus 2x over here. We didn't actually add in or multiply in anything

00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:25.753
extra to the left side, so that means we don't need to change the right side at

00:00:25.765 --> 00:00:25.949
all.
