00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.060
Since it is well known that processes scheduling

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.040
is np complete we have to resort to heuristics

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.680
to come up with good scheduling algorithms. the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.780
literature is ripe with such heuristics, as the workload

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.780
changes And the details of the parallel system,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.850
namely how many processors does it have, how many

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.560
cores does it have, how many levels of caches

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.370
does it have, and how are the caches organized.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.100
There's always a need for coming up with better heuristics. In other words,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.780
we've not seen the last word yet on scheduling algorithms for parallel systems.
