00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.545
We know that this exponent of -1, attached
to the base of y here, means that we can

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:15.494
rewrite this factor, y^-1 as 1 / y^1.
And we know that y^1 is just y. So y^-1 =

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:22.055
1 / y. Now let's insert this, in this spot
of y^-1 in this term. So now, we have

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:28.033
3(1/y) * x^3.
All of these factors are just multiplied

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:32.080
together, so we can write our fraction
right away. In the numerator, we have 3

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.967
and x^3.
And, the only thing written in the

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:39.201
denominator is the y. So, our final answer
is 3x^3 / y.
