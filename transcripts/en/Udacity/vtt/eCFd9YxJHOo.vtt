00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.300
So, you are looking at the project for
this course.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.630
Notice how it's not responsive at all.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.030
At the ends of lessons 2, 4, and 5,

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.312
you'll be challenged to improve
this site's responsiveness.

00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:16.010
I want to make it super,

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.560
super clear that there is no
right solution to this challenge.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.490
You'll hear us repeat throughout the
course that responsive design is an art,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.680
not a science.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.310
To improve your responsive design
skills, you'll just have to practice.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.509
I'll be talking through
the decisions we made, and

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.580
the steps we took to make
this site responsive.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.880
And I really don't expect your
answers to look anything like ours.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.190
This course is all about
thinking responsively.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.720
Sure, we want you to walk away with
a few new CSS tricks up your sleeves.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.490
But more importantly, I want you to
walk away approaching responsive design,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.300
from the right mindset.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.220
I'm recording this video now after
having spent several months working with

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.890
Pete on this course.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.920
Over this time I have
actually learned quite a bit.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.190
I'd done some responsive work before,
but

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.870
I hadn't approached my sites the way
you'll be learning in a few minutes.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.900
A few weeks into filming I decided
to revamp my personal site.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.950
And this is what I came up with.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.480
Now I know it isn't the prettiest
thing in the world,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.170
but it's nicely responsive.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.190
And believe it or not this website
actually only took a few hours to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.760
build over a weekend, that wasn't too bad.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.320
What helped is that I approached
responsiveness systematically from

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.480
the start instead of
just as an afterthought.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.660
All this is to say, that thinking
responsively is a huge help for

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.750
your development.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.720
So, are you ready to get started?

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.430
Are you excited to get responsive?

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.970
Let's get started.
