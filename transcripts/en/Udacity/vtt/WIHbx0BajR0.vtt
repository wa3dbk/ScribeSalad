Neuroplasticity in brain growth is not just an abstract idea. It can have

00:00:04.415 --> 00:00:09.080
serious and powerful effects on who we become. The brain is growing most as a

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.170
fetus, and this is when we can get things really right or really wrong. What a

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.890
pregnant mother eats or otherwise takes into her body, such as drinking

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.405
something or chemical exposure, can dramatically affect brain development.

00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:26.655
Teratogens, or substances that can cause permanent damage to the developing

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:29.350
embryo or fetus are really important here.
