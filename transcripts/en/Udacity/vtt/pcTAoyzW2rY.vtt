00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.225
So now that we have seen that flat page
tables can be quite large, even for

00:00:04.225 --> 00:00:08.145
32-bit address spaces, and
are too big to even fit in memory for

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:12.904
64-bit address spaces, let's talk about
multi-level page tables, which is how we

00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:16.730
reduce the size of page tables when
we have a large address space.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.180
So, the problem with flat page tables
is that their size is proportional to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.710
the address space, meaning,
how much memory can the application

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.418
possibly address, not how much
memory it is actually using.

00:00:28.418 --> 00:00:30.558
For a 32-bit address space,

00:00:30.558 --> 00:00:34.295
we have seen that we have
a reasonably sized page table.

00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:37.123
So, for 32-bit virtual addresses,

00:00:37.123 --> 00:00:40.800
the flat page table size
is several megabytes.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.370
Note that we can have a very small
application that only uses a couple of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.930
kilobytes of memory, yet it still
needs a page table of this size,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.740
because the page table size has nothing
to do with how much memory we are using,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.996
it has to do with how much
memory can we possibly address.

00:00:56.996 --> 00:01:03.540
For 64-bit virtual addresses, a flat
page table would simply be too big.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.160
The page table would be many
many gigabytes in size, so

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.420
we simply cannot use it
because it wouldn't fit in

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.850
the amount of physical
memory we actually have.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.500
So multi-level page tables are designed
to try to overcome both of the problems.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.370
We want the overall size of the page
table to be proportional to how much

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.195
memory we are using and
we want our page table to work even for

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:32.010
64-bit virtual addresses, as long as
the program is actually not using

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.090
the entire 64-bit virtual address space,
which no program really does.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.590
The idea of why multi-level page
tables work has to do with how

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.140
the virtual address space is
usually used by the applications.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.501
Recall that the application thinks
it can address memory with 64-bit

00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:55.810
addresses, so it has this many potential
memory locations it can access.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.130
But in reality the application
only allocates memory like this.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.020
At the beginning of the virtual memory,
there is the code, the static variables,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.020
and the heap, and at the top of
the virtual address space is the stack.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.580
So, we're really talking about two
contiguous regions of virtual memory

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.890
that are actually used
by the application.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.740
And even if these two are several
gigabytes each, in a 64-bit

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.000
address space, there will by many, many
terabytes of unused address space here.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.920
But in a flat page table,
we had to have a page table entry for

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.588
each page in this huge space here.

00:02:37.588 --> 00:02:43.290
So a multi-level page table,
combines the idea of a flat page table,

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.690
where we use some bits from the virtual
address to index the table.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.200
This works really well in hardware.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.430
Hardware really likes using some
bits to index some sort of an array,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.500
but we want to avoid the use of table
entries that correspond to this.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.710
Meaning, we want to have a pretty
normal page table like thing here,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.210
and here, but
somehow not have anything for this so

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.250
that we can simply omit
those page table entries.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.960
Now that we have the idea for
what we want,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.730
let's see how the multi-level
page table is actually organized.
