00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.760
In order to implement the singleton pattern, the first thing you do is define

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.210
a class variable holding the instance. Then, you can define a class operation

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.100
that creates the instance and saves a reference to it in the class variable.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.510
The operation checks whether the instance already exists and if not creates it.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.960
In order to protect yourself from creating other instances in implementing

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.610
the Singleton pattern you make the constructor private or protected.
