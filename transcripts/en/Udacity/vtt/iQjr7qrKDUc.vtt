00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So on the subject of statement coverage, we will take a very short quiz.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The quiz is going to have two parts, both of which

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
stem from a little statistics module that we have here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The function stats is defined to take a list of inputs and what the function does is

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
computes the smallest element in the list, the largest element in the list, the median element of the list--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that is to say if we order the list numerically the middle element where the average of the two

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
middle elements if the list has an even number of elements and finally, it computes the mode of the list 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
where the mode is the element which occurs the most frequently in the list.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In the case where the list is bimodal--meaning it has two modes or

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
multimodal--more than two modes--we'll print all of it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What we do here is test the stats function extremely badly, so I'm going to create a list containing

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
only the #31 and I'm going to call stats on the list and so let's look at the coverage that we get.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We can see here that even my fairly bad test managed to cover 29 statements in

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the stats function but these statements are uncovered and it's shown right here.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Your assignment for the first part of this API quiz is to--early collection

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
of test cases for it which is 100% statement coverage.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What I mean by that specifically is that your job is to construct a several lists,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
calls stats on them, and cover all statements.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What I'd like you to do is think about it a little bit, try to visualize the effect that your inputs

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
are having on the code, try to come up with the corruption of inputs that gets false

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
statement coverage on the first try but then, of course, check your answer using the coverage tool.
