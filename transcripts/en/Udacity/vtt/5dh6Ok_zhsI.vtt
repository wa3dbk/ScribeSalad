00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.814
We've just talked about which display method gets called int present question

00:00:03.814 --> 00:00:07.890
method? The method has a parameter whose type is question. So here's the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.847
parameter variable. It contains an object reference which points to an object,

00:00:11.847 --> 00:00:15.239
an object of what type, while you think it's question, because that after all

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.260
has the type of q, but not so fast, the type of q, the variable isn't the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.710
question. The type of the object is really not known. It could be any sub-type

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.900
of question. Now the good thing is, that when the program runs it does the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.510
right thing. At runtime, it's determined what the exact type of this object is.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.352
And its display method is caught. That might be question.display, choice

00:00:38.352 --> 00:00:43.345
question display, or the display method of some other class. That also extends

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:46.790
the question class, this is a very useful feature because it allows us to write

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.182
generic codes such as present question that works with questions of any type

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:53.415
and actually this diagram should be familiar to you, you've seen the same

00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:56.860
diagram when we talked about interfaces and there is the name for the fact that

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.664
the correct version of a method Get selected at run time. Remember what that's

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:11.015
called? Was it object already has programming? Incapsulation? Inheritance? Or

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:12.191
Poly morphism?
