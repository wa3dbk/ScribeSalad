00:00:00.052 --> 00:00:03.407
Let's go back to our test criteria subsumption representation, where

00:00:03.407 --> 00:00:06.770
we already had branch coverage and statement coverage. In this case,

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.350
if we want to add condition coverage to this page, we

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.050
have to put it here on this side, with no relationship

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.830
of subsumption with either branch coverage or statement coverage, which

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.270
means that the criteria are not comparable. So now let's consider

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.108
again our last example, and let's use a different test

00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:25.060
with this time. We still have two tests, but the first

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.575
one has x is equal to 0 and y is equal to minus

00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:30.370
5. And the second one, x is equal to 5 and y is

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.350
equal to 5 as well. Let's see what happens in terms of condition

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.740
coverage, when we run these tests. If we look at the first condition, x

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.820
is equal to 0. It is both true, for the first test case,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.240
and false for the second one. As for the second condition, y greater

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.800
than 0, it is false for the first test case and true for

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.770
the second one. Therefore we've achieved a

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.400
100% condition coverage with these two tests.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.020
But what about branch coverage? If we consider the whole predicate,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.620
instead of just the individual conditions, let's see what happens for the

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.090
two test cases. If we look at the first one, because

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.200
x is equal to 0, the overall predicate is true. As for

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.750
the second one, because the second condition is true, the overall

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.110
predicate is true. In other words, despite the fact that we're exercising

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.520
all the possible values for the two conditions, the overall predicate is

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.540
always true. And therefore, we're covering only one of the two branches.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.591
So our coverage will be 50%. This is the reason

00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.231
why normally the two criteria that we just saw, decision

00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:26.205
coverage, and condition coverage are considered together. And the resulting

00:01:26.205 --> 00:01:30.320
criterion is called branch and condition coverage, or also decision

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.030
and condition coverage. At this point the test requirements and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.590
the coverage measure should be pretty straight forward, because they're

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.120
just considering the two criteria together. As far as the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.960
requirements are concerned, they include

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.880
all the branches and individual conditions

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.580
in the program. Where as the coverage measure is computed

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.180
considering both coverage measures, both branch coverage and condition coverage.
