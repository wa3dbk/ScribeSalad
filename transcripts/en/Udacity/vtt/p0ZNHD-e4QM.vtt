00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.845
In order to create motion, we first
need to be able to keep track of time.

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:09.590
LibGDX provides a fantastic
TimeUtils package to make this easy.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.160
There are two main methods of interest,
TimeUtils.milis and TimeUtils.nanoTime.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.580
Let's say this is a timeline and
this is right now.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.783
What TimeUtils.millis()
gives you is the number of

00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:26.340
milliseconds between right now and
January 1st 1970.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.351
This is great if you want to know what
time it is, like the time on a wall

00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:35.630
clock, but it's not always the best
choice for measuring time intervals.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.730
When games are rendered
at 60 frames per second,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.870
individual milliseconds start to matter.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.120
So it's often best to use the more
precise TimeUtil of nanoTime.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.610
nanoTime gives the time in nanoseconds.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.138
That's billionths of a second.

00:00:48.138 --> 00:00:52.685
But it doesn't have a definite reference
time, so if this is right now,

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:57.210
TimeUtils.nanoTime might give you
the number of nanoseconds since like

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.770
sometime in 2005, or it actually might
be a negative number of nanoseconds

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.850
from now until sometime in the future.

00:01:05.038 --> 00:01:09.190
However, what nanoTime does allow us
to do is to measure time intervals.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.320
So our general procedure is to save
the time that our game was created, and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.520
then all future times can be measured
with respect to that creation time.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.020
Let's check it out.
