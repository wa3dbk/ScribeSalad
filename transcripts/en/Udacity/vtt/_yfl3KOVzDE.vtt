00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is the structure of the machine.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Each letter of the message would be divided into 5 bits, and those would be XOR'd

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with the value coming from the corresponding K wheel.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
These wheels would rotate with each letter,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and at each position they either had a 0 or a 1,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
depending on whether there was a pin in that position or not.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Each wheel had a different size.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The last one had 23. The first one had 41. They were different-sized wheels.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This would also be XOR'd with the result from the S wheels,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
which worked similarly.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They also had positions that were either 0s or 1s around the wheels.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The different was the K wheels turned every character.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The S wheels only turned conditionally on the result of 2 other wheels,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
which were the M wheels. The M1 wheel would turn every time.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The M2 wheel would rotate depending on the value of the M1 wheel

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and depending on the XOR of those, either all the S wheels

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
would rotate by 1 or none of them would.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Then the result of all these XORs is the cipher text.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The is similar to the idea behind a one-time pat.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We're XORing message with key.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But the key is not a perfectly random sequence. It's the key generated by this machine.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
To break the cipher, once you knew the structure of the machine, that's not enough.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You need to know the initial configuration.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Here's the intercepted message that was intercepted over the radio.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We can think of all the characters in the message.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The important thing to remember about the Lorenz cipher

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
is that the message encoding each character--each character is encoded into 5 bits,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
using the Baudot code.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The cipher text is in these same sequences where each cipher text bit

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
corresponds to one bit of that letter.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The next one corresponds to the next bit of that letter.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We can think of the cipher text being broken into channels

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
corresponding to each part of the letter.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
That means each channel would be the sequences that repeat every 5.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This would be part of the first letter, part of the first letter.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
This would be the second part of the first letter.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
This would be the second part of the second letter.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And this would be the third part of the first letter.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This would be the third part of the second letter and so on.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We can think of each of these as a separate channel.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
What we're going to do is use a new notation.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We're going to subscript Z by channel and the letter for that channel.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Zc sub i is the ith letter for channel c.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.000
In terms of this mapping, if we look at channel 0, that's going to be Z0, Z5, Z10.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We can just break the cipher text up into channels.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The key reason for doing this is because of this weakness that was noticed in the cipher.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The key weakness is that all these S wheels move in turn.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Either when we advance one position

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
they're the same for all the channels or they advance by one for all the channels.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The value of each of these depends on the message.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It also depends on the outputs of the K wheels,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and it is also XOR'd without outputs of the S wheels.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
By separating it into those three pieces, we're going to be able to take advantage

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
of the properties that they have.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The key insight is that the S wheels don't always turn.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
If we look at subsequent characters,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
there's a good chance that the S wheels have not changed.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We're going to define ΔZ sub c, i

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
as the difference between 2 subsequent characters in the cipher text for that channel.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
That's XOR'd with Zc of i plus 1.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Now because this is for that channel, these are five-characters apart

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
in the intercepted cipher text, but they're adjacent for that channel.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
What happens when we look at these values for two different channels?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
We're going to look at channel 0,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and we're going to XOR that with the delta value for channel 1.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Plugging in the definitions, that's just the result of Z XORing all of these values.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Where this becomes valuable is because we can break these down into the three parts.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Let's break them own into parts, separating the M, the K, and the S parts

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that combined into this cipher text.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
What we get is these three things.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000
For the message bits we have the XORs of all the message bits for the two channels adjacent

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and the key bits XOR'd with the message bits.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Then we have this for the S bits as well.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I want to ask a brief quiz here.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:13.000
For each of these combinations--this is Δm, ΔK, and ΔS.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Supposing we could separate each of those, the question is which of these

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
inequalities are likely to be true.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Each one we're asking whether the probability of that part being 0 is greater than 1/2.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
If it was a uniform distribution, the probability would be equal to 1/2.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
If it's not uniformly distributed, then the probability could be less than or greater than 1/2.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I'm asking here are there any of these that we can be confident--

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
or at least have a good likelihood --that the probability of the delta for the component

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
is equal to zero.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Let me remind you what the components are.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The message is text in a language, and in this case it's in the language German.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
These are the K wheels. Each wheel rotates with every character.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
They have pins around the wheels deciding if it's a 0 or a 1.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
These are the S wheels.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
The S wheels rotate only when the output of the M wheels is a 1.

00:06:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Sometimes they don't rotate at all. Sometimes they all rotate at the same time.
