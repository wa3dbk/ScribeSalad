00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:05.230
The premier U.S. example of a large
scale, in this case statewide,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.080
centralized health information exchange,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.900
is the Indiana Health
Information Exchange, or IHIE.

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:17.870
Its Indiana Network for Patient Care
creates a single virtual community-wide

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.560
health record and delivers more than a
million transactions per day from a data

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.150
warehouse that contains 5 billion
pieces of clinical data for

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.350
some 10 million patients.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.240
Docs 4 Docs provides a web portal
to make it easy for physicians to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.370
obtain documents like lab test results
or reports on images they've ordered.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.850
Quality Health First is
a population-based quality reporting

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.400
system we'll look at in Lesson 8.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.880
Image Zone is an image repository that
allows physicians to see any image done

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.980
on a patient anywhere in the exchange
area from their office computer.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.920
ACO Services is the newest
offering of IHIE that

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.250
provides tailored management tools for
that environment.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.140
Providing these services means
aggregating data from many sources that

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.550
are not inherently interoperable.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.550
The key component of this
diagram is data governance,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.370
a sophisticated engine that bridges
differences in data syntax and

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.440
semantics across these sources to create
a single database in a standardized

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.080
format, as though everyone were using
the same electronic records system.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.610
This screenshot from the Indiana Network
for Patient Care illustrates that.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.950
Here, a single patient's
data from diverse sources

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.160
is presented to a provider as though
it all came from a single record.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.210
It's even formatted
similarly to a typical EMR.
