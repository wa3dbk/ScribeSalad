00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.390
Because new developments are
automatically inserted in the tab order,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.160
they can be very convenient to use.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.140
But there are instances when you'll
want to modify the tab order.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.117
Like if you're building a component
without a native analog,

00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:15.656
like this dropdown up here, or if you
need to have something off screen that

00:00:15.656 --> 00:00:19.101
should only be focusable when it
appears, like perhaps a modal window.

00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:22.889
For these cases,
you can use the tabindex attribute.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:25.859
Tabindex can be applied
to any HTML element, and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.046
it takes a range of numeric values.

00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:33.780
A tabindex of -1 means that the element
will not be in the tab order,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.520
but it can be programmatically
focused via JavaScript,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.050
by calling the element's focus method.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.430
This can be especially useful for

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.790
off screen content which appears on
screen in response to a user event.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.620
When the new content is displayed,
you may wish to call its focus method

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.582
which will then direct future
keyboard events to it.

00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:56.570
A tabindex of 0 will add the element
to the natural tab order,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.660
plus, that element will also be focus
full by calling its focus method.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.570
For example,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.170
here I've got a fancy button that
I've created out of just a div.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.380
Now, without a tabindex attribute,
if I press the Tab key,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560
this element will not receive focus.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.050
By adding a tabindex of zero,
now when I press the Tab key,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.412
this element gets focused, and future
keyboard events get directed to it.

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:19.230
A tabindex of greater than zero, for

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.790
instance something like tab index of
5 will jump the element to the front

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.000
of the tab order regardless
of where it is in the DOM.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.401
If there are multiple elements
with a tabindex greater than zero,

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.986
the order will start from the lowest
value that is greater than zero and

00:01:32.986 --> 00:01:34.096
then work its way up.

00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:38.212
In general, using a tabindex greater
than zero is discouraged and

00:01:38.212 --> 00:01:40.670
considered a bit of an anti-pattern.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.640
If you get in the habit of using it,
you can quickly end up with a very

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.340
jumbled tab order, and it can make
things especially confusing for

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.490
screen reader users who navigate
the DOM in a linear fashion.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.420
Ideally, if you need to put
something earlier in the tab order,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.300
the best bet is to
move it up in the DOM.
