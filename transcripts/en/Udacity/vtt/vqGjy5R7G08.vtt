00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.337
We have seen how P Threads serve as an API for for the development of

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:10.270
parallel programs. For distributed programs, sockets serves as an

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.230
API for application development. And conventional distributor programming

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.470
such as NFS servers and so on use socket API

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.555
And build RPC packets on top of that. But unfortunately socket API

00:00:25.555 --> 00:00:30.688
is too low-level and insufficient in semantic richness for emerging

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:35.770
multimedia distributed applications. Similarly sockets serve

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.020
as the API for distributed program development. So conventional distributed

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.750
programs are built using socket API, for example you man have a server

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.600
like an NFS server, and clients connect to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.510
an NFS server using sockets, in order to do the

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.140
distributed I/O between the client and the server. But unfortunately,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.830
socket API is too low-level, and it doesn't have the semantic richness

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.400
that is needed for emerging novel multimedia distributed applications.
