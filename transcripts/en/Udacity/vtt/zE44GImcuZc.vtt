00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So the other approach for solving this is what's known as an auditing mix net,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and the idea here is that each participant in the mix net can audit some of the outputs of the next step.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So to do that, we need to provide extra inputs.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So instead of the voter just providing the vote as encrypted to party A,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
they'll provide it to party B as well.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
All of the incoming votes go to the next two steps.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And now B going to audit A and it does that by picking some random set of inputs.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So let's say it picks this one and it picks this one, and it picks some of the ones in here.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So that means it's looking at some A's ouputs, and we'll call these y values.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So this would be y2, this would be y something else, and this would be y of n-1.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
All right.  And this would be y of n.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So for each of the n inputs, Bob picks some number to audit.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And what B does is ask A to prove that y2 is a valid input.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
In order to prove this, what does A need to provide?

00:01:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What must A provide to B in order to prove that y2 is a valid output from A's mix net?
