Since you just got to practice a compound inequality with an and, let's try a

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:09.758
compound inequality with a or. So, we have 6 x plus 5 is less than 3 x plus 2,

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.565
or 2 x plus 7 is grater than x plus 11. We know since it's a or problem, we're

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:19.491
going to need a union. You can put your answers in these boxes, and I've already

00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:25.559
put the union sign for you. If you need to write infinity, type in \inf and the

00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:27.946
infinity symbol should show up.
