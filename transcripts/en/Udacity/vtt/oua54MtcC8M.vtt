00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.880
Now I'll turn that into a question for you. How

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.800
should the scheduler choose the next thread to run on

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.810
the CPU? I'm going to give you four different choices. The

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.640
first is, first come first served. That is if I

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.580
have a bunch of threads, the scheduler says, well, which

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.380
was the earliest one that was ready to run on

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.090
the processor? That's going to be the one that I'm going to

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.210
schedule. That is first come first served. The second possibility is,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.850
it's going to assign static priority to all the threads

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.950
so it's going to pick the threads that have the

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.750
highest static priority to run on the processor. The

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.650
third possibility is that the priority is not static, but

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.450
it is dynamic or in other words it changes

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.710
over time. And so what the scheduler is going to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.320
do is pick the one that has the highest

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.450
dynamic priority. And the fourth choice is, its going to pick

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.590
a thread whose memory contents are likely to be in the cache of

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.840
the CPU. So these are the four choices, and I want you think about

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.950
it and come up with some thoughts as to what might be the

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.530
right thing that the scheduler might do, in picking the next processor to run.
