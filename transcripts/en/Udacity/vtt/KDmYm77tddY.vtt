00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.584
let's evaluate each side of each equation, starting with this one up here. Log

00:00:04.584 --> 00:00:10.486
base 10 of 100 is 2, and log base 10 of 1000 is 3. So, we have 2 over 3 for

00:00:10.486 --> 00:00:16.271
this side. On the right-hand side we have log base 10 of 100 again, or 2, and

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:23.740
then, minus 3 for log base 10 of 1000, this equals negative 1. Unfortunately

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.520
for this equation, two thirds is not equal to negative 1, so this is not a true

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.101
statement, we need to put a not equals sign here. Let's move over here to this

00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:39.232
equation. The left-hand side right now is log base 10 of 100 over 1000. So let's

00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:43.172
look at whats inside the parentheses and simplify that. 100 over 1000 is 1 over

00:00:43.172 --> 00:00:49.314
10 and 1 over 10 is the same as 10 to the negative 1. Log base 10 of 10 to the

00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:54.643
negative 1 is just negative 1. Great. What about the right-hand side? Well this

00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:59.062
is the same as what we had over here. And we got negative 1 for that. Sure

00:00:59.062 --> 00:01:04.090
enough negative 1 is equal to negative 1. So, this equation is true. Awesome.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.310
Now what about this last one here? Well, once again let's start with what's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.953
inside the parentheses here. We have log base 10 of 100 minus 1000. Which is

00:01:13.953 --> 00:01:18.585
the same as log base 10 of negative 900. Hm, I'm not sure what this is so how

00:01:18.585 --> 00:01:23.891
about I pull out the calculator and we'll see what this equals. So we have log

00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:30.134
base 10 of negative 900, and look at that we get an error. I wonder why that

00:01:30.134 --> 00:01:34.795
is? Well actually, we know why. We're trying to take the log of a negative

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:38.978
number, and you learned before that, that is not allowed. This is just not

00:01:38.978 --> 00:01:43.270
equal to a real number. On the right-hand side, we have what we had over here,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.621
two thirds. Well, two thirds is a real number, so that means this equation is

00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:53.636
not true. This second one, log base 10 of 100 over 1000, is equal to log base

00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:59.881
10 of 100, minus log base 10 of 1000. Is the only example of the quotient rule

00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:04.659
being used properly of these three equations. This is a great check to show

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.756
that the quotient property actually works. And I hope it's also pointed out

00:02:08.756 --> 00:02:12.340
some easy ways that you might accidently make a mistake when you're trying to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.959
use it.
