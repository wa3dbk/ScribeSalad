00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.051
We talked to Keith Smiley, an iOS
engineer from Lyft, and Izmir Sing,

00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:05.639
an iOS engineer from Venmill,

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:10.128
about what it was like to migrate
their apps from Objective-C to Swift.

00:00:10.128 --> 00:00:13.090
Keith and Izmir are intimately
familiar with the challenges and

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.710
triumphs of achieving interoperability
between the two languages.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.200
So we asked them about the problems
they encountered most frequently.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.950
To wrap things up, in Lesson 6 we'll
review the most common challenges for

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.780
interoperability between the languages
of iOS, and you'll complete a set of

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.330
coding challenges to sharpen
your interop skills.
