David, what do you think?

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.100
Where should the agent put,
Handle is Fixed, in this explanation?

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.450
&gt;&gt; So it seems like the most obvious
place to put it would be under

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.910
the Object is Liftable connection.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.870
In order to make it liftable to enable
drinking, it needs to be fixed.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.900
&gt;&gt; What do you think, is this a good
way to fix the agent's error?
