00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.015
Often, what we're encountering,
the pain that we're discussing,

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:15.790
the frustration that we have,
is actually the result of past success.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.530
We probably have to keep in mind
Moore's Law and other laws that apply to

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.340
the improvements that have happened
in tact, so things move very quickly.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.570
I talked about this in
a couple of context,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.110
but Ken Schreiber is one
of the agile signatories.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.200
He talks about three sources of
variation in software development.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.850
So one of them is infrastructure,
it's changing all the time.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.770
The other is requirements,
there is always new and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.490
different things that we can do.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.370
And the third is people,
people working individually and

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.370
people working together as teams.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.090
And I think in this regard,
you find yourself in an organization,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.030
you see that things are frustrating,
and I think, or

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.650
that they're not perfect, and I think
you have to take the perspective,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.750
with this sword, right [LAUGH], with
these people, I will solve this problem.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.040
Otherwise, it becomes like
blame focused, right?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.540
And so, without that appreciative
inquiry, and without that

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.620
belief that your sort of colleagues in
your organization is healthy in the way

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.940
that I just described,
your options are super limited.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.850
I can't fix the problem because
it's the attitude of my colleagues.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.030
And so what I want you to try to do is I
want you to view the situation you're in

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.090
as maybe an inevitable
result of early successes.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.560
And this really changes the paradigm
to one of like, okay, everything that

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.080
we did to get us here today has
been super helpful and awesome.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.790
It also cannot be or may not be what
takes us forward to the future.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.200
So what is that going to look like?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.360
And then you can turn right to those
same people who created the current

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.020
awesome in your organization.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.787
Yes, some pain came with that,
but the current awesome.

00:01:58.787 --> 00:02:03.106
And you can work with them, through
inquiry, to find new ways forward.

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:08.300

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.958
So the healthiest mindset you
can have as you approach DevOps

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:17.390
transformation is one of inquiry and
appreciation.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.890
So appreciation for
your environment, appreciation for

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.070
your colleagues, even an appreciation
for the problem domain.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.280
It's very easy to see the limitations
of your system in the present moment,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.750
so it's easy to blame.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.320
It's much harder to look
to your colleagues,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.520
to look to the situation as
an opportunity to create new things.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.640
And I think that's the heart of
DevOps is being able to recognize

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.560
that there is a path forward, and
that path forward is only going to be

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.340
realized when we work together, when we
take a stance of appreciative inquiry.
