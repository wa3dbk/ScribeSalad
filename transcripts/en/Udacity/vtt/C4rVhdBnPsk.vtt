00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Think of this like a Python.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's 1 times the value of one step to the left--1 times the value one step to the right--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
minus twice the value at the original position.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And now we have to insert this Python into itself.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If you look at this one, one step to the left, we have to go one further step to the left

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
times 1, this 1 times -2 and this 1 times 1.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So one further step to the left is this one, two steps to the left minus 2.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This was the one, one step to the left--1 is our original one.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Similarly for the right one, we go one further step to the right and so on and so on.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
One step to the left and minus 2 times the original one.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
For the central one, we have to multiply the Python by -2, so we've got -2, 4, -2,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000
which boils down to 1 times the value 2 steps to the left minus 4 times the value 1 step to the left

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
6 times the value at the center minus 4 times the value of 1 step to the right

00:01:09.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and 1 times the value 2 steps to the right.
