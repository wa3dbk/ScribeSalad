00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is that you can't tell.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is a different type of combinatorial problem than the previous ones.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In the previous ones we had a fixed number of variables,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and we knew how many combinations we had for each variable.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In the zebra problem, there were 25 variables, and that's all there was.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We could enumerate all the combinations.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
For the pouring problem we're trying to not fill static variables

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but rather put together a sequence of actions to go from one state to the next.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We don't know how long that sequence is, and of course,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
at each point we have 6 different options of different ways to go.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
From each of those 6 more.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We know it's going to be roughly 6 to the something,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because we branch 6 at each point,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but we don't know what that x is, because we don't know how long the sequence is.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So that makes the problem slightly different.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If we want to be foraml, we call it a combinatorial optimization problem,

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but usually we just called it a "search" problem.
