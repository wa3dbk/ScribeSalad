00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.490
It would take 60 hours or about two and a half days for the pool to fill. Great

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.220
work if you found this. This is the equation that we'll use to help us solve.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.864
We can fill the pool in 10 hours, and we can drain one pool in 12 hours. We

00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:18.770
know that when you subtract the 1 12th here since it takes longer to drain the

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.538
pool than it does to fill it. In other words this rate is it slower than this

00:00:24.538 --> 00:00:29.960
rate? And this should make sense, since we know 1 12th is smaller than 1 10th.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.780
So, the pool will fill up ever so slightly, and we can figure out the total

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.122
time that it takes to fill the pool, this is x. We start solving this equation

00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:44.970
by multiplying through by the LCD 60x. The common factors of 10 and 12 are 2.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.095
The other factor of 10 is 5, and the other factor of 12 is 6. We multiply these

00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:53.755
factors together, which give us 60, and then we have to multiply by x, the

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:59.212
other factor in our denominators. We multiply by x since x is not a common

00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:06.336
factor of 10 or 12. So 60x will be our LCD. This first term will reduce to 6x,

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:11.820
since 60 divided by 10 equals 6. The second term will reduce to 5x, since 60

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.110
divided by 12 equals 5. This leaves us with the right hand side of just 60.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.892
Combining our like terms on the left, we'll have 1 x equals 60, so x equals 60

00:01:20.892 --> 00:01:25.620
hours. The time it takes to fill the pool with the drain open.
