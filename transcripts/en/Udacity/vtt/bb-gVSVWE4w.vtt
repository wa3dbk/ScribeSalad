00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.150
Let's look more closely at the product of these two factors and this polynomial.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.929
Do you remember that number puzzle that we've been playing? Well, there's a deep

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:12.331
connection going on between these factors and this number puzzle. We know all

00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:17.110
three of these forms are equivalent. And for the number puzzle, I'm going to put

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.940
a 30 in the top and 11 in the bottom. So what are the answers to this number

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.823
puzzle? Write them in here.
