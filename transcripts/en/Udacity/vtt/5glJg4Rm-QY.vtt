00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.287
We know that we need to multiply both sides by x. But, what does it mean to

00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:08.243
multiply this entire side of the equation by x? Well, it means that

00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:12.503
multiplication by x needs to distribute to both terms on this side of the

00:00:12.503 --> 00:00:17.163
equation, since we're multiplying the entire side by x. 7 times x is, of course,

00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:22.952
just 7x. Then we can distribute and simplify the left-hand side, x times 3 over

00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:28.301
x just gives us 3. And x times negative 1 over 5x gives us negative 1 over 5.

00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:33.553
And in the end, we get 14 over 5 equals 7x, which of course looks like what we

00:00:33.553 --> 00:00:34.470
had before.
