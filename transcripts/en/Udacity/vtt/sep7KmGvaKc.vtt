00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.420
While loops in Swift aren't
particularly surprising.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.780
They take the form, while, condition,
and then in between curly braces,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.670
the statement that you want to execute.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.040
Here's a while loop that's
counting down a timer.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.500
While the timer's greater than zero,
Decker meant the timer.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.800
In here you can see the loop
gets executed ten times.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.020
Here's another while loop,
simulating having a beer with friends.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.730
A beer with a lot of
toasting as it turns out, so

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.370
while beer volume is greater than zero,
cheers.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.350
And then subtract the amount
you set from the volume,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.419
and here you can see in the sidebar
that it's being executed 40 times.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.110
Notice that here and
in the previous while loop,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.430
there are no parentheses around the
conditions, just like with for loops.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.760
Let's move on to repeat while loops.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.560
Repeat while loops take the form repeat,
then the statements you want to execute

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.430
in between curly braces,
while a certain condition is true.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.852
And as you can see, unlike while loops,

00:00:56.852 --> 00:01:01.710
repeat while loops execute one time
before the condition is evaluated.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.129
So I went ahead and commented out
the previous two while loops, and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.290
you can see that we can write each
of those while loops as repeat while

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.140
loops like so.
