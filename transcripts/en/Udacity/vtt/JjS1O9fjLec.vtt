00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.450
So let's start by seeing how these activities and principles

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.640
are reflected in the key features of the Rational Unified

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.010
Process. First of all, the Rational Unified Process is a

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.700
software process model. So if you recall our introductory lessons,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.670
that means two main things. The first one is that

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.200
it defines an order of phases that have to be

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.970
followed in the software process. And the second thing is

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.420
that it also prescribes transition criteria, so when to go

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.030
from one phase to the next. The second key

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.290
feature of RUP is that it is component based. And

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.810
also in this case, this implies two main things.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.410
The first one is that a software system is defined

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.420
and built as a set of software components. So

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.110
software components are the building blocks of our software system.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.550
And the second one is that there must be well-defined

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.440
interfaces between these components, interfaces

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.750
through which these components communicate.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.020
In addition, the Rational Unified Process is

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.080
tightly related to UML. And in particular, it

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.820
relies extensively on UML for its notation, and

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.120
with respect to its basic principles. Finally, the

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.140
three main distinguishing aspects of the Rational Unified

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.830
Process are that it is use-case driven, architecture-centric

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.680
and iterative and incremental. So let's now look

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.565
in more detail at these three distinguishing aspects,

00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:17.540
and we're going to look at each one of them individually.
