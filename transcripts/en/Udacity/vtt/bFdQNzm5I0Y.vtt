00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.000
To illustrate analogical reasoning and

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.740
design, or analogical design, we'll talk about a specific problem,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.440
let us suppose we design a robot that can walk on water.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.790
Nature already offers several examples of organisms that can walk on water,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.130
this is a picture of the basilisk lizard, which can walk very well on water and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.370
catch it's prey. Recall that we said earlier that for analogical mapping and

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.470
crossword worker row, requires a deep understanding of the source case and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.740
the target problem. That is true here as well in case of analogical design,

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.500
we require a deep understanding of the locomotion of the basilisk lizard,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.870
in order to be able to design a robot that can walk on water, inspired by

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.490
the design of the basilisk lizard. Here is a model of the basilisk lizard,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.010
this model is sometimes called structure behavior function model.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.880
This particular picture doesn't show the structure,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.940
it just shows the function and the behavior. The function is shown at

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.660
the top here, It is shown by it's initial state and it's goal state, and

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.900
it's function is achieve by behavior shown here. The behavior is represented as

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.620
a series of states, and transitions between those states. We will not talk about

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.970
the representations in more detail here, readings given in the class notes

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.890
give this sort of representations a lot more detail if you are so interested.
