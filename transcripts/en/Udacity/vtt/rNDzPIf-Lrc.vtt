00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.052
k is only involved here in the constant term at the end, and the constant term

00:00:05.052 --> 00:00:09.899
in our equation with numbers is 5. So, you need to take all of the constant

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:14.876
terms from this equation which are h squared and k, and have them equal to the

00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:19.881
constant here, which is 5. We already know what h is so now, we just solve for

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:22.177
k. I find that k equals negative 4.
