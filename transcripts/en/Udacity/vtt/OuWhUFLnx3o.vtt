00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.490
We can summarize the means-ends analysis method like this.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.030
Compare the current state and

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.230
the goal state. Find the differences between them. For each difference,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.370
look at what operators might be applicable. Select that operator that gets you

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.449
closest to the goal state from the current state. We did this for the blocks and

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.212
worlds problem. We also did this with regards to the business problem. But

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:26.534

00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:30.810
us close to the goal state. This is the means-ends analysis method in summary.
