00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.496
Remember that the reason Athena is creating all of these box models in the first

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:08.565
place, is for her architecture internship. So, that means that when she's

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:12.518
discussing functions like this one, she's probably going to want to focus on the

00:00:12.518 --> 00:00:16.672
values of the domain that make sense in the physical situation she's discussing.

00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:21.088
We figured out before, that if Athena wants to make sure, that she's actually

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:25.483
able to fold her piece of paper into a box, x should be greater than zero. But

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:30.677
it should also be less than 2.5 inches. However, we saw that if x equals zero,

00:00:30.677 --> 00:00:35.284
then the volume equals zero. And if x equals 2.5, the volume also equals 2.5.

00:00:35.284 --> 00:00:40.222
The idea of zero volume is actually pretty understandable. It's negative volume

00:00:40.222 --> 00:00:44.399
that's the issue. So, I'm going to go ahead and decide to include these

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.554
endpoints in our domain. So, here we go. This is the domain of the function that

00:00:48.554 --> 00:00:52.276
we've decided upon, using our common sense to deal with the situation at hand.

00:00:52.276 --> 00:00:55.680
So, like we talked about in the last lesson, this is not a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.920
mathematically-imposed domain restriction. This is one that we're imposing upon

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.910
the equation ourselves to make the equation better fit the situation of the box.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.150
So, let's visualize this with a graph using this domain restriction. So, here's

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.990
what a graph of this function looks like with these domain restriction put in

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.607
place. We can see that the graph is only allowed to take on values of x between

00:01:19.607 --> 00:01:24.008
0 and 2.5. And as shown in this inequality, our interval includes these end

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:26.813
points, so they are closed circles to either one.
