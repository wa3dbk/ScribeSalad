00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.760
Here are the centers and here are the radii. Great work, if you figured each of

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.254
them out. Let's start by focusing on the center. Remember the center is at h, k

00:00:10.254 --> 00:00:16.288
and we take the sign that's opposite and this parenthesis. So, we know the x

00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:21.730
coordinate here is positive 1 and the y coordinate of the center is positive 2.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.125
This is the h value. This is the k value. For this second one we'll have

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:31.464
negative three for the x coordinate of our center. This is our h value. And

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:37.550
we'll have positive 3 for the y coordinate of our center. This is the k value.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.330
And notice that since these signs match, we just take the positive 3 for k

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.154
whereas here we have to have negative 3 for the value of h. This third one

00:00:47.154 --> 00:00:50.330
might have been tricky. We'll have positive 7 for the x coordinate of our

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.526
center and we'll have 0 for the y coordinate of our center. There's nothing or

00:00:55.526 --> 00:01:01.763
subtracted in parentheses for this y, so we know the k value is just 0. And

00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:06.456
finally for the last one we'll have negative 4, 2 for this center. We change

00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:13.068
the sign here and we change the sign here. Now let's focus on the radius. If we

00:01:13.068 --> 00:01:16.990
take the square root of the number on the end, we get the radius. So, the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.330
square root of 16 equals 4, the square root of 1 equals 1, and the square root

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.688
of 49 equals 7. For this last one, we'll take the square root of 8, which

00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:30.485
really equals 2 root 2. Now, you could have just written square root of 8 and

00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:35.374
that would have been correct as well. These two are the same number.
