When I first started talking about the grade book I told you how my friend

00:00:03.085 --> 00:00:07.218
generated comments for each student. If you're feeling ready for a challenge,

00:00:07.218 --> 00:00:11.157
try writing a method which returns a report card comment. Use your creativity

00:00:11.157 --> 00:00:16.317
here. There are tons of possible right answers, so feel free to experiment. I

00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:20.248
won't try to grade you on this one. If you don't feel like doing this, you'll

00:00:20.248 --> 00:00:23.718
have many more chances to experiment as you continue programming.
