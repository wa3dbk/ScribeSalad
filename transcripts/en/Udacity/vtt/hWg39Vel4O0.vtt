00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.794
If you got these answers excellent work. This would be the expanded form for the

00:00:04.794 --> 00:00:09.445
first problem. We have four 2s and three 2s. So all together I would have 2 to

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:14.347
the 7th. I have seven 2s multiplied together. The second problem is very similar

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:19.011
to this first problem. Instead of having a 3 as our base, we have an x. We have

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:23.829
some unknown number. So we have 3 of those x's multiplied by 2 of those X's. So

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.744
all together, we have 5x's multiplied. Or X to the 5th. Here's the expanded form

00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:33.393
for the 3rd expression. Notice that I have x's and y's. So these bases aren't

00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:37.833
the same. And i can't combine them. I just have to list x to the 3rd and y to

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:42.394
the 4th. That's my answer. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; For the last problem, this is the expanded

00:00:42.394 --> 00:00:46.573
expression. Since I have a product of factors, I can rearrange the factors to

00:00:46.573 --> 00:00:50.800
group the like terms together. For example, these x's can be moved over here.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.834
And these y's can be moved to the right. We can do this because the community

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:59.067
property of multiplication. We know 3 times 2 is the same as 2 times 3. If ever

00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:03.472
I have a bunch of factors, I can rearrange the order of those factors. We'll

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:07.587
still wind up with the same number. Now this is a little bit easier to see. I

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:11.869
have x to the 7th and y to the 7th. So these are the most simplified expressions

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:12.795
with exponents.
