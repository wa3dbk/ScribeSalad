If you said 10, nice work. This is a little bit tricky, so let's walk through

00:00:04.145 --> 00:00:07.896
how to actually do this. I'm going to show you two ways to find the common

00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:11.836
denominator. The first way is listing out the multiples. I have 5 for one

00:00:11.848 --> 00:00:15.919
denominator, and I have 10 for the other. I'm going to start by listing out the

00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:21.581
multiples of 5. I have 5, then 10, then 15, 20, and so on. To get to the next

00:00:21.593 --> 00:00:27.591
multiple, I just add 5. For 10, I can list out its multiples as well. 10, 20,

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:33.965
30, 40, and 50. And it keeps going. To find the denominator, I want the lowest

00:00:33.977 --> 00:00:39.941
number that both 5 and 10 go into. When I think about the lowest number they

00:00:39.953 --> 00:00:45.086
both go into. I see that it's 10. So I know I'm going to need to split this bar

00:00:45.098 --> 00:00:49.878
into tenths, and this one into 10ths. Luckily, this one's already in tenths.

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:54.839
Another way to find the common denominator is to find the factors of 5 and 10.

00:00:54.948 --> 00:00:59.756
I'm going to use a factor tree. I know the common factors for 5 and 10 are 5. So

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:04.769
I put that in the middle. The other factors are 5, or 5 and 1. Because 5 times 1

00:01:04.782 --> 00:01:09.915
makes 5. The other factor of 10 has to be 2, because 5 times 2 makes 10. If I

00:01:09.927 --> 00:01:15.115
multiply all these numbers together, 1 times 5 times 2, I get 10. Either way, I

00:01:15.127 --> 00:01:17.665
can still find the common denominator.
