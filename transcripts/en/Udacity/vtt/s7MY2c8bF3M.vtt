00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
And this is, I promise, going to be the most

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.140
complicated part of this unit.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.010
Once you've understood this,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.070
you have understood how to prove the Cook-Levin theorums,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.290
so bear with me for another minute here.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.700
If we write this huge Boolean formula

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.190
what I would like to ask you now is

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.670
what properties this Boolean formula has.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.610
So if I write a big Boolean formula like this here,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.050
so the train that's exactly one variable here

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.270
is set to true one here, one here, and so on and so on.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.350
What I would like you to think about is

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.140
some of the properties that this Boolean formula will have.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.340
So there are 3 properties of 3 choices that I'm giving you.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.130
One is that the size of this Boolean formula here is polynomial in in.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.140
The second one is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.430
that this Boolean formula here has only a single satisfying assignment.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.160
And the third one is that every satisfying assignment

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.350
of this Boolean formula

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.200
presents a potential snapshot,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.840
so it kind of uniquely defines what the memory of the RAM looks like

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.040
and where the program is at.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.160
Now of course, there's only 3 choices here;

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.130
again, more than 1 can be true and you could

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.510
make your way through by guessing,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.070
but before that, I'd encourage you to think through these statements,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.960
because once you understand this part,

00:01:16.960 --> 99:59:59.000
the rest of the Cook-Levin theory is actually quite easy.
