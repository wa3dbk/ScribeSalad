00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.280
Discretization or discretizing is
an important step in this whole process.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.170
What we want to do is
have a way to convert

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.440
a real number into an integer
across a limited scale.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.130
In other words, we might have hundreds
of individual values here between 0 and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.140
25 of a real number, and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.091
we want to convert that into an integer,
say between 0 and 9.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.830
There's a fairly easy way to do that and
I'll show you how right now.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.880
So here's what we do.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.590
First thing is we determine ahead of
time how many steps we're going to have.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.030
In other words, how many groups do we
want to be able to put the data into?

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.243
Like I said before,
to have an integer between zero and

00:00:48.243 --> 00:00:50.930
nine, we would use ten in this case.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.510
So we divide how many data
elements we have all together

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.250
by the number of steps.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.410
Then we sort the data, and
then the thresholds just end

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.358
up being the locations for
each one of these values.

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:10.389
So in other words, if we had,
say, 100 data elements and

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:13.958
we were going to have 10 steps,
our step size is 10.

00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.758
So we just find the 10th
data element and

00:01:16.758 --> 00:01:22.380
that's our first threshold, and
then our 20th and 30th and so on.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.620
It ends up looking something like this.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.990
When the data is sort of sparse,
our thresholds are set far apart.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.480
When the data is not sparse, these
thresholds end up being closer together.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.770
So in this particular example,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.640
our thresholds might end up
looking something like this.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.718
And when we go to query,
when we have a new value and

00:01:43.718 --> 00:01:50.200
we want to see what is its discretized
value, we'll say it was a value here.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.945
Boom, it's between those two thresholds,
so it would be an 8.
