00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
One definition of NP says, that a problem is in NP, if it has a short accepting certificate.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
An accepting certificate is information that we can use to quickly show

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that the answer to the decision problem is yes, (if it actually is yes)

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and here, short means polynomial size and quickly means polynomial time.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
To define NP even more formally, we're going to say a problem is an NP

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
if there is a verification in algorithm.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This is a basically computer program on A like a subroutine A

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
such that for any input for the problem that is a "yes", there is a certificate C

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
such that the size of C is polynomial in the size of x, and the verification algorithm will say "yes"

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but for any x that is a no, there is no certificate C that's polynomially sized with respect to x

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and the verification algorithm says "yes", so for any yes answer to the problem,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
a verification algorithm will say "yes" for some small certificate;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
otherwise, it'll say "no" for all small certificates.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
For the Sudoku example, the verification algorithm is what we describe

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
as something to take the original Sudoku problem with things not filled in

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and the answer is printed in the back of the magazine where the answer filled in,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and it checks to see whether this is the actually a solution to that.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If it is, then it says "yes" and if it's not, it says "no".

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now this is going to fit the NP definition that we've got here

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
because for any Sudoku problem that is solvable, there is some grid that we solve it and we can show

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
what that grid looks like, but for any problem that it's not solvable,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
there is no way that we can fill in this grid with numbers.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So that the verification algorithm will say that it's okay.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It really is back to the definition of basically the Sudoku problem.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The Sudoku problem says, "Is there a way of filling it in?"

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And the certificate that we use is, well, we'll show you how it's filled in.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It fits both half of this definition, so this problem is an NP.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Now let's be a little careful here because Sudoku as it's typically designed,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
doesn't really have an input size; all the inputs are of the same size.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
but you can imagine a generalization of Sudoku where you have a bigger grid

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and maybe more symbols and the same kind of verification procedure works.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The bigger the grid gets, the longer it takes to run,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
but it's always a polynomial in the size of the input grid.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Let's try to put this definition to work and answer the following question:

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Is P contained within or possibly equal to NP?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So one possibility here is, I don't know, and if I knew that, I'd win a Fields Metal!,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
meaning sort of the equivalent of the Math Nobel Prize

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
because this is a big important open question.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The other choice is no, P is not contained within NP because if the problem is NP,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
it means it's decidable in polynomial time and we don't need any kind of certificate

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and so, it's not an NP and then finally the opposite of that is,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
yes if it can be decided in polynomial time, no certificate is needed.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So if you have a problem that's NP, then you don't need any sort of certificate, so it's also in NP.
