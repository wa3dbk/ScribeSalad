00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer here is you get no path.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This criterion alone asks that all the y's are as similar as possible.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If it's minimized, then all the y's are the same, which means you only get a single point,

00:00:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and we get no path at all.
