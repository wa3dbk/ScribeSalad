00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.262
The first two graphs here, which are the ones with even degree, are these two

00:00:03.262 --> 00:00:07.413
graphs down here. The one with the positive leading coefficient is graph D, the

00:00:07.413 --> 00:00:11.465
one whose ends are both pointing upward. It's coming from up high on the left

00:00:11.465 --> 00:00:14.850
and rising up again on the right. B is the graph that has an even degree, but a

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.608
negative leading coefficient. It's coming up from negative infinity on the left

00:00:18.608 --> 00:00:22.500
side and dropping back down there again on the right. The top two graphs both

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.902
have odd degree. Graph A has a negative leading coefficient, since it's

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:30.385
starting way up high and then dropping down low on the right. And graph C has a

00:00:30.385 --> 00:00:34.829
positive leading coefficient, since it's starting low and then rising high.
