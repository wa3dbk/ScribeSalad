00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.474
Let's go through these possible answers one by one. To start off, both of these

00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:10.310
functions do have y intercepts. In fact, every single exponential function has

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.404
a y intercept. We'll talk more about that later. Since the domain of each of

00:00:14.404 --> 00:00:17.938
these is all the real numbers, we must be able to plug in 0 for x and get a

00:00:17.938 --> 00:00:24.120
valid number for y. Which tells us where the y intercept is. Now, let's move on

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.742
to asymptotes. Both graphs have horizontal asymptotes at y equals 0. Neither of

00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:35.674
them however, has a vertical asymptote or a slant asymptote. Now it's easy to

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:39.834
mistake these steep parts of the curves for vertical asymptotes. But, that just

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:45.216
goes to show rapidly they grow or decay. These steep sections do not represent

00:00:45.216 --> 00:00:49.198
discontinuities, or breaks in the graph, like vertical asymptotes would. In

00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:56.856
fact, since the domain is all the real numbers, these graphs are continuous.
