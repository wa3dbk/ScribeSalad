00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:08.077
So first let's find the average of all these values. You can see that the values

00:00:08.077 --> 00:00:15.184
go all the way to 101. Since there's not a value in cell a1, there are 100

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:24.283
values. So here, we'll write equals average, a2, through a101. That gives us the

00:00:24.283 --> 00:00:33.940
average. Now here, we type a2 minus whatever we got for the average, which is

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:42.748
our deviation. So equals, a2 minus 50,586.36. I usually like to round it to two

00:00:42.748 --> 00:00:49.529
decimal places. Make sure that you don't put in any commas. Now, we drag this

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:56.440
down, all the way to cell b101. And now we have each deviation from the mean, so

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.538
remember, this is xi minus x bar. Now we're going to square each deviation.

00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:11.357
Equals, b2 squared. And again, we're going to drag this all the way down. Now we

00:01:11.357 --> 00:01:19.328
can find the average of the squared deviation, which is the variance. So we

00:01:19.328 --> 00:01:29.288
write equals average c2 colon c101. So now we have the variance. And finaly, we

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:39.038
take the square root of the variance to find the standard deviation. Equals SQRT

00:01:39.038 --> 00:01:47.352
of cell f1. And you always kjow if you are using the right cell, if there is a

00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:55.850
dotted line highlighting it. So here it is. You should have gotten approximately

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.557
10,657 for your standard deviation. Due to rounding, there is a range for

00:02:01.557 --> 00:02:06.373
answers that were correct in this quiz. Good job! This is really tough stuff.

00:02:06.373 --> 00:02:11.124
And actually, this is probably one of the most complicated calculations that

00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:14.379
you'll have to do throughout the rest of this course.
