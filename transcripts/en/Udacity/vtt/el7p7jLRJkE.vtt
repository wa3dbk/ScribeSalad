00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.666
We know that whatever is under the square root side has to be greater than or

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:07.539
equal to 0. Because otherwise we'll be taking the square root of a negative

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:11.920
number and we don't want non-real solutions in this case. So finding the domain

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.544
of a square root of x minus 5 is solving an inequality. You have to set x minus

00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:20.944
5 greater than or equal to 0. This gives us x is greater than or equal to 5 and

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:23.653
[foreign] that's our new domain restriction.
