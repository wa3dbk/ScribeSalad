00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.730
In the last lesson,
we began to define what computation is

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.990
with a goal of eventually being precise
about what it can and cannot do.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.370
We said that the input to any
computation can be expressed as a string

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.740
and may assume that whatever
the instructions that were for

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.060
turning input into output, that these
two could be expressed as a string.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.340
Using a counting argument,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.880
we were able to show that there were
some functions that were not computable.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.910
In this lesson we're going to look
at how input gets turned into

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.120
output more closely.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.000
Specifically, we're going to
study the Turing machine and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.020
the classical model of computation.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.750
As we'll see in a later lesson, Turing
machines can do everything that we

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.880
consider as computation and
because of their simplicity

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.880
they are a terrific tool for studying
computation and its limitations.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.870
Massively parallel machines,
quantum computers,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.980
they can't doing anything a that
a Turing machine can't do.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.640
Turing machines were never
intended to be practical but

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.260
nevertheless several have been built for
illustrative purposes.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.810
Including this one, from Mike Davey.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.360
The input to the machine is a tape, unto
which the string input has been written.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.720
Using a read right head,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.200
the machine turns input into output,
through a series of steps.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.250
At each step,
a decision is made about whether and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.620
what to write to the tape, and whether
to move it to the right or to the left.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.580
This decision is based
on exactly two things.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.330
The current symbol under
the read write head and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.140
something called the machine state.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.080
Which also gets updated
as the symbol is written.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.090
That's it.
The machine stops when is reaches one of

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.310
two halting states,
named accept and reject.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.760
Usually we're interested in which of
these two states the machine halts in.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.400
Though when we want to compute
functions from strings to strings,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.350
then we pay attention to
the tape contents instead.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.540
It's a very interesting historical
note that in Alan Turing's 1936 paper,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.230
in which he first proposed this model,
the inspiration does not seem to come

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.070
from any thought of
an electromechanical device, but

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.370
rather from the experience of
doing computations on paper.

00:01:56.508 --> 00:02:01.520
In section 9 he starts from the idea
of a person who he calls the computer,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.320
working with pen and paper, and

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.180
then argues that his proposed machine
can do what this person does.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.520
So here I am, a computer,
with my pen and paper.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.630
And we'll follow Turing's argument
that his machine can do what I can.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.080
Let's take an example.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.373
He's talking about computable numbers,
so I'll compute a very simple number,

00:02:23.373 --> 00:02:25.685
Alan Turing's age when
he wrote the paper.

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:30.470
So we'll take 1936- 1912,
which is equal to 24.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.640
He argues that any calculation
like this can be done on a grid.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.370
Like a child's arithmetic book her says.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.600
I assume he means something
like wide ruled graph paper.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.460
He argues that all the symbols can be
made to fit inside one of these squares.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.230
Then he argues that the fact
that the grid is two dimensional

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.890
is just a convenience.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.420
So he takes away the paper and says
that computation can be done on a tape.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.650
As someone who has to carry out the
computation, I don't much care for this.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.510
But I can still do my job.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.610
Then he points out that there are limits
to the width of my perception.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.320
So if I happen to be reading
a very long mathematical paper,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.980
the phrase "hence (applying this
big Theorem number) we have.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.130
Then when I look back,

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.140
I probably wouldn't be sure at a glance
that I had found the right theorem.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.190
I would have to check, maybe three or
four digits at a time,

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.740
crossing off the ones I had matched,
so as not to lose my place.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.720
Something like this.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.080
So I match the first four,
then the next four, and so on.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.340
And so forth.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.220
Eventually, I will have matched them
all and can re-read the theorem.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.630
Now, since Alan Turing was going for
the simplest machine possible,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.615
he takes this idea to extreme and only
let's me read one symbol at a time and

00:03:42.615 --> 00:03:46.745
only move right or left one square
on the tape at a time trusting

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:51.885
to the strategy of making marks on the
tape like I did with this theorem here,

00:03:51.885 --> 00:03:56.085
and my state mind to accomplish
the same things as I would

00:03:56.085 --> 00:03:58.620
under normal operation with pen and
paper.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.020
And with those rules,
I have become a Turing machine.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.690
So that's the inspiration, not
a futuristic vision of the digital age,

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.820
but probably Alan Turing's own
everyday experience of computing

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.480
with pen and paper.
