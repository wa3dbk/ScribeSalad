Notice that we weren't given the actual time for Katrina to travel upstream or

00:00:03.815 --> 00:00:08.596
the actual time for her to travel downstream. We just have expressions for each

00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:12.943
of these. But we do know something about the sum or the total amount of time

00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:17.950
she spends on the river. So I want you to think about what equation you can

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.750
write in order to solve for x. When you think you've got it enter it here.
