00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.460
In the 1980s,
Richard Grinold was seeking a method of

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.890
relating performance, skill,
and breadth in investing.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.470
So for instance,
you might be a very skilled investor,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.900
meaning that you can pick stocks well,
but

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.610
you might not have many opportunities or
breadth to exercise that skill.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.830
So Grinold felt that there must
be some equation whereby we could

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.509
combine skill and breadth to
create an estimate of performance.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.880
He developed a relationship he called

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.350
the Fundamental Law of
Active Portfolio Management.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.660
I'm going to state it here at the
beginning of the lesson, and then spend

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.950
the rest of the lesson trying to justify
it and show you why it makes sense.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.370
And here's his expression,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.730
performance is equal to skill
times the square root of breadth.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.630
So we need some measure of skill and
some measure of breadth.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.180
So if you want to improve your
performance you can improve skill, or

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.170
you can find more and
more applications or methods or

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.620
opportunities for applying that skill.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.520
So, as an example breadth might relate
to how many stocks you invest in and

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.120
skill relates to your
skill in choosing them.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.680
So, again you can invest in
either improving your skill or

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.520
improving your breadth.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.780
So performance is summarized in
something called information ratio,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.870
which is very much like the sharpe
ratio that we've discussed before, but

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.850
it refers to the sharpe ratio of excess
returns, in other words the manner

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.460
in which the portfolio manager is
exceeding the market's performance.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.990
Skill is summarized in something
called Information coefficient and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.050
and breadth is just how many
trading opportunities we have.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.600
Okay.
So,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.010
we'll expand more and more on
this as we go through the lesson.
