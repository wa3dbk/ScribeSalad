00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Narrator] That's what append does.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're going to introduce 2 other list operations.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The next one is plus.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Plus behaves very similar to the concatenation operation for strings.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If we have the list 0, 1 + the list 2, 3

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the result is the list 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What plus does like concatenation for strings is it produces a new list.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It doesn't mutate either of the input lists.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I want to introduce 1 other operator that works on lists, and that's the len operator.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Len is short for length, and we use len

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
like this: it looks like a procedure call.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We pass into len the object that we want to know the length of that can be a list.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Len actually works for many things other than lists.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It also works for strings.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It works for any object that's a collection of things,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the output from len is the number of elements in the input.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
For example, the result of len applied to the list 0, 1 is 2,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
since there are 2 elements in the list.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The result of applying len to this list is also 2.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It looks like there are many more elements here,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
but len is only counting the outer elements.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If 1 of the elements of a list is a list, it doesn't matter how many elements that list contains.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It only contributes 1 to the length of the original list,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so the result of this call would also be 2.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We can also use len on a string, and the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
output will be the number of characters in the string.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In this case the string Udacity has 7 characters, so the output is 7.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now we are ready for some quizzes to see how well you understand

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the 3 list operations we've introduced.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The append operation which is invoked on a list

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and takes an element as a parameter and adds that element to the end of the list.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The plus operator which operates on 2 lists as its operands

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and produces a new list that consists of all the elements in the 2 lists put together.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And finally the len operator that takes a list as its input and produces

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
an output number that is the length of the list.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The number of elements in the input list.
