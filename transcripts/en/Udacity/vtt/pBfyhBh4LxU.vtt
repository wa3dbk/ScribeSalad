00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.490
Here is how I did that. In the outer loop, I just go through all of the people.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.432
This inner loop is one of the algorithms that you've seen in lesson seven. It's

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:15.945
the algorithm to find something. I keep on iterating over all the cars until

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:21.682
I've been successful. In each step, I look at the ith car, I tried to add my

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:29.006
passenger, that method will tell me whether I was successful or not. If I am,

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:33.911
this variable gets to be true and I fall out of the loop.
