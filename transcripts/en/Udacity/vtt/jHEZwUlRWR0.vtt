So imagine that you have gone to the hardware store and bought a robot. This is

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.060
a household robot. Usually the robot goes into the kitchen, makes coffee and

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.040
brings it to you in a cup. However, last night you had a big party, and

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.560
there's no clean cup available in the kitchen. The robot is a creative robot and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.470
looks around, and it finds an object. And this object is light and

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.110
made of porcelain. It has a decoration. It is concave. It has a handle.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.480
The bottom is flat. The robot wonders, could I use this particular object like

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.480
a cup? It would want to prove to itself, that this object,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.180
in fact, is an instance of this concept of cup. How might the robot do it?
