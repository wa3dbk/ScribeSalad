00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.043
What if instead I didn't give you slope and the Y intercept, but I just gave you

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:08.106
2 points? Well, we remember from before we could calculate the slope from these

00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:12.013
2. We want the rise divided by the run, the difference of the y values divided

00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:16.008
by the difference of the x values. We can calculate the slope to be negative 3

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.695
halfs. And, again, we don't have the y intercept so, we need a different

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:23.980
approach to actually write our equation. We're going to use something called

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.571
point-slope form. We can have one point be x y since both variables appear in

00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:33.606
linear equations. At least, equations that are not horizontal or vertical lines.

00:00:33.606 --> 00:00:38.200
If we multiply both sides by the denominator x minus x 1 we can reduce this to

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.222
make 1. This is our point-slope form. We call it point slope form since we have,

00:00:43.222 --> 00:00:48.032
well, a point and the slope. We know these two points define a line so let's use

00:00:48.032 --> 00:00:52.872
the same process to find the equation of our line. I know the slope is negative

00:00:52.872 --> 00:00:57.204
3 halves and then I make one of the points be xy And now I'm going to plug in

00:00:57.204 --> 00:01:02.125
one of these points. So what do you think? Which point is best to use for x1 y1?

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:06.780
Should we use this point, or should we use this point. Which one do you think

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.161
would be easier to substitute in here?
