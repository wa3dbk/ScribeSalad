00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.980
Okay let's begin to look at each of

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.745
our data quality metrics in a little more detail.

00:00:04.745 --> 00:00:08.140
We'll start by looking at the validity metric. Here

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.560
we are primarily concerned with individual field values. For

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.900
example, we might have fields that are mandatory

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.510
there must be a value there. We might have

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.270
fields that must have a unique value in each

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.606
data item. We might have fields with foreign-key constraints.

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:27.860
An example might be product records. Each of

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.210
which must have a reference to a manufacturer. And,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.680
that manufacturer must exist in our database. We might

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.260
have cross-field constraints. What I mean by this is,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.810
essentially conditions on multiple fields. So, for example,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.570
the start date must come before the end date.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.780
Now for most fields, we're also going to be

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.680
expecting a specific data type. Or, a particular structure

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.930
of some kind, if we're talking about JSON data, where fields

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.630
can have values that are themselves dictionaries or arrays. We might

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.920
also have fields that we expect to have a particular patterns,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.220
a pattern we can test using regular expressions. Some fields will

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.420
have values that we expect to be in a certain range.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.110
This might be a numeric range that we can do bounds

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.290
checking for, or we might be talking about set membership of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.790
some kind, so all tee shirts have to have a size

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.530
field that's small, medium, large, or extra large.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.020
Auditing validity is about determining what the constraints

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.600
are on individual fields and checking to make

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.160
sure the field values adhere to those constraints.
