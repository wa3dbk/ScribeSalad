00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Male] Question 6.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Given the variables s and t defined as

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
udacity is assigned to s, bodacious is assigned to t,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
your goal is to write some Python code

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that will print out "udacious"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
without using any quote characters in your code.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So you should be able to print "udacious"

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
extracting from what you have in the variables s and t

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
without needing to use any new quote characters.
