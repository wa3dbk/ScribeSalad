00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.740
So overall, Sam I think did
a great job with the interview.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.240
Again, it's not important that
you get everything right.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.260
I think you hit on the things that I
thought were important in the interview.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.960
So being able to have knowledge
of intents and services, and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.800
those things were important and maybe
a sense of use everyday in all your

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.500
applications, but at least he has
a good knowledge and a grasp for that.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.540
His solutions, I think sometimes
when you ask people these very

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.960
open ended questions, they freeze.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.810
So he has some creative
solutions I think, but

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.820
I kept kind of probing and
like, what else could happen?

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.350
He did a great job there.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.730
I would have liked if he followed up
with more questions like I've made some

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.860
questions very vague and
he asked some follow up questions, but

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.190
I think there's plenty
more to kind of touch on.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.830
Again it's just important when you don't
have a very well structured problem,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.780
there is structure, but
the interviewer has that knowledge and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.340
some of the concepts, you could tell
he's used in the past like there

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.800
are some things about
Android that he used but

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.650
he did not quite understand like maybe
the names or some of the concepts.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.920
So I think kind of making sure that
you can resolve this thing that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.660
you've done in Android to the name of it
is as important as well, but overall,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.420
I think Sam did a great job and he's
the type of developer we wish to hire.
