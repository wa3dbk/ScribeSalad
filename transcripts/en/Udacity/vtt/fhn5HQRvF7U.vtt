00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
[Narrator] A type is just a set of similar objects like numbers or strings with associated operations,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and we've run into things like numbers in strings before,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but there are more exotic types that also support operations,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and as we can see even from this little doodle diagram

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
sometimes there are operations like plus that apply to all of these things.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I can add 2 numbers using arithmetic.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I can concatenate 2 strings or I can append together 2 lists.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They mean almost the same thing but not really.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Arithmetic addition is not really the same as string concatenation.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Similarly, both strings and lists support length.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Here, it's the number of characters; here, it's the number of elements.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Each one of these things, number, string, list, is a type,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and what we basically want to do is make sure that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we're not mistakenly combining elements from various types or unsafely calling non-associated operations.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
For example, 5 divided by 2 makes a lot of sense,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
but the string hello divided by the string 6, we have no idea what this means.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Division isn't one of the operators for strings even though it is one of the operators for numbers.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let me give you another analogy of this that sort of bares reference to the real world.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The word execute can mean many different things depending on what it's being applied to.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
A computer can execute a program which means to run it or to carry it out.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
There are some governments in the world that will execute their citizens,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and this means to kill typically in a judicial context.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
These do not mean the same thing, but the word looks otherwise similar,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and it falls in the same sort of grammatical pattern.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
They're both verbs being applied to objects.

00:01:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We're going to need to tell the difference.
