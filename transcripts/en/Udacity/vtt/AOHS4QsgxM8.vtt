00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.550
Once we collected the required knowledge on the requirements for

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.120
the system that we're developing, we need to model it in

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.430
a structured and clear way, so that it can be

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.100
analyzed and refined. And there are really tons of ways to

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.840
do that, depending on your focus and objectives. More specifically,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.940
when modeling requirements you need to decide what you want to

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.710
model and how you want to model it. So let's look

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.390
at these two aspects independently. What you decide to model depends

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.270
on where your emphasis is. That is on which

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.390
aspects of the requirements you want to focus. For

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.880
example if your emphasis is on the characteristics of

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.970
the enterprise of the company that you are analyzing you

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.240
may want to model goals and objectives of the

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.380
company, or its organizational structure, its task and dependencies

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.040
and so on. Conversely, if your focus is on

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.500
information and behaviors, you might want to concentrate on aspects

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.800
such as the structure of information, various behavioral views

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.480
some of which we will see in the next

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.650
lesson, or maybe time or sequencing requirements. Finally, if

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.750
you're mostly interested in the quality aspects of your

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.790
system, you will focus on the various non-functional properties

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.070
of the software that are relevant in the context

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.570
considered. For example reliability, robustness, security, and so on.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.550
You will just pick the ones that are relevant for

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.540
your context. And as we said, there's a second dimension.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.050
After you have decided what to model in your system,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.480
you have to decide how you want to model it.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.860
So I want to show here some options for modeling

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.380
enterprises, information, and quality aspects. And as you can see

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.100
here for each type of information there are many possible

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.840
models that we can use to represent it. And all

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.750
these models have advantages and

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.400
disadvantages, different levels of formality and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.000
different focus. Something else that I want to point out

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.145
about these models is the fact that these models are often

00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:50.980
orthogonal to one another, especially if we consider models in different

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.620
categories. So what that means is that they're complimentary rather than

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.310
mutually exclusive. Different models can be used to provide views

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.290
of the requirements from different perspectives, and we will not see

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.700
most of these models in this course, but I wanted to

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.550
list them anyways to give you an idea of how many

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.490
there are and how vast is this area. As far

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.540
as we are concerned in the course and for the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.660
projects we will express requirements using one of two main

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.010
ways. Using natural language, that is informal specifications and using

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.600
UML diagrams, which is graphical models. And we will introduce

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.840
UML and the most important diagrams in the next lesson.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.330
And the only other type of models that I want

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.610
to mentions explicitly are goal models because they're extremely popular.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.930
So the main idea with goal models is it start with the main goal of

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.990
the system and then keep refining it

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.654
by decomposing it in sub-goals. So it's kind

00:02:39.654 --> 00:02:41.610
of a very natural way of progressing.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.210
And you continue this refinement until you get

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.150
to goals that can be operationalized, and represent

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.380
the basic units of functionality of the system.
