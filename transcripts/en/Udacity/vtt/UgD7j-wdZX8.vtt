00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.296
x cannot equal negative 5. If it did we would end up dividing by 0 since the

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:10.279
denominator would be negative 5 plus 5. This means that negative 5 is not part

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.580
of the domain of f, since the function is not defined here.
