00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.280
Now, I get slightly more complicated
in the case where there can be

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.380
only one policy.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.550
And that's because for the very reason
that we described in the first quiz,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.630
where if I know with certainty,
there's only one policy, and

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.840
I know with certainty, the human gives
me the right answer, the moment you tell

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.220
me that some action is correct, I now
know something about the other actions.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.210
So it becomes complicated.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.410
Somehow, what you've told me about
a second action tells me something about

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.580
the first action.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.850
And when you go through all the math,
it's still a multinomial.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.010
And when you go through all the math and
do the derivation, and

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.440
the derivation's available for the
students, you end up with this quantity.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.018
That the probability that a particular
action A is optimal given a sequence

00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:44.062
of labels is what we've seen before,
it's c raised to the delta sub

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:50.109
a (1-c) raised to all the other evidence
that we have from the other actions.

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.420
And then there's a normalization
factor which I don't write out here.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.948
And this corresponds to what
we did in the last example,

00:00:56.948 --> 00:01:02.368
where we wrote out 0.8, 0.2, and
0.2 and then normalized everything out.

00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:03.610
&gt;&gt; And
let me make sure I understand that.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.490
So we have 1.2, the delta is 1.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.140
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.040
&gt;&gt; No, but it's 0 for the other guys?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.550
What's delta j?

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.040
Delta j is for the other actions.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.020
&gt;&gt; Yes, this is the difference between
the times you said yes and no for

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.300
every other action that isn't the
particular action you're asking about.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.304
So this provides evidence
from the other actions.

00:01:23.304 --> 00:01:24.680
&gt;&gt; I see, and
then we're going to normalize.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.735
So maybe that squiggle equals
wants to be like an alpha,

00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:29.493
like a proportional to symbol?

00:01:29.493 --> 00:01:34.196
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, I usually write squiggle,
where I grew up in the South,

00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:36.130
that meant approximately.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.450
But there, that make you feel better?

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.468
&gt;&gt; Much better, because it's not
really approximately, it's actually

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:44.634
proportional to, which means we're
going to have to normalize afterwards,

00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:46.923
so that we get the 0.8,
we get a 0.2 and a 0.2.

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:49.720
And then when we normalize it,
we get the 2/3, 1/6, 1/6.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.650
Awesome.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.100
And the right thing
kind of happens there.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.720
And you could write out what
the normalization factor is, and

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.170
then we don't have to have an alpha
here, we can have an equals.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.280
But it's big, long, and hairy, and it's
just much simpler to actually ignore it,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.460
do this part, which is really easy.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.150
And then do the normalization
afterwards.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.830
More to the point,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.080
since what we care about is a policy,
we only care about which one's maximal.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.480
We don't actually care about
the actual probability.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.406
&gt;&gt; I'm forgetting why
we care about a policy.

00:02:13.406 --> 00:02:14.560
&gt;&gt; Remember.
&gt;&gt; because we're trying to,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.190
because ultimately,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.670
we're combining this information
to figure out what action to take.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.450
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.370
&gt;&gt; If all we're doing is listening to
human beings, then when a human tells

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.250
us something, we want to pick the action
that's most likely to be optimal.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.390
And so it doesn't matter what
the actual probability is so

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.640
long as we have the ordering right.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.050
And so we don't have to normalise.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.360
We don't have to know the probability,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.150
we just have to make certain
we get the maximum one right.
