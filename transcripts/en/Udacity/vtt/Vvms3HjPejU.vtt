00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.961
For any of these points I'm going to start at the origin, count over in either

00:00:04.973 --> 00:00:10.163
direction, as many slots as I need to horizontally. And then, count either up or

00:00:10.175 --> 00:00:14.886
down. So it's going to give me first the x value, and then the y value of that

00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:21.323
point. So for point a, I need to count over 1, 2, 3, 4. I can see that this is

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:27.019
the vertical line that a lies on, and then I need to come up this line toward a,

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:32.782
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So a must be the point for 7. I can do the same thing for

00:00:32.794 --> 00:00:39.488
b, starting at the origin. I count in the negative direction, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6.

00:00:39.898 --> 00:00:45.979
So my x coordinate is negative 6. And then from there, I count up to b, 1, 2, 3,

00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:52.880
4, 5. For point c, once again the x value is negative, since it's to the left of

00:00:52.892 --> 00:00:59.726
the origin, 1, 2, 3, 4. So negative 4. And then c has a negative y value, since

00:00:59.738 --> 00:01:05.808
it's below the x axis. So from here I need to count down negative 1, negative 2,

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:12.104
negative 3, negative 4. And last but not least, d has a positive x value, 1, 2,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.127
3, 4, 5, 6, and a negative y value, negative 1, 2. So it's the point 6, negative

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.265
2.
