00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.670
So let's look at the more general
redundancy-based approach which is

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.440
the N-module redundancy.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.140
For N = 2, we have already
seen a brief example of that.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.230
We call this dual-module redundancy and
we have seen that it can

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.230
guarantee detection, but
not also correction of one fault.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.040
Or one faulty module for that matter.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.520
Note that we can detect, sometimes,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.280
more than one fault, as long as these
faults are in the same module, or

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.360
as long as they're affecting
different results of the modules.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.350
But all we can guarantee really,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.010
is that a single fault will be detected
and we cannot guarantee its correction

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.008
because really this technique
doesn't correct anything.

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:44.560
N = 3 gives us what's called
triple-module redundancy,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.330
and it allows us to
correct any one fault, or

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.510
even all faults,
produced by a single faulty module.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.040
Again, sometimes we can tolerate
more than one faulty module

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.050
if the two faults in the different
modules don't affect the same result.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.860
But all that we can really
guarantee as far as the number

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.020
of faults we can correct is that all
faults that occur within the same module

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.040
will be corrected, and

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.110
that's because the other two modules are
functioning correctly and their correct

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.630
outputs are going to output whatever
the faulty one is producing.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.431
We also have examples when N = 5, and

00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:24.240
that would be called
five-module redundancy.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.270
A good example for
that is the space shuttle.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.870
It has five computers that are doing
the same thing, and then they vote.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.510
If we get one wrong result in a vote,

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.480
we just continue normal
operation of the space shuttle.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.570
If we get two wrong results in a vote,
the mission would be aborted, but

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.480
there is still no failure
because the three

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.940
correct wrong results are still
out voting the two bad ones.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.770
We are aborting our mission because
if another module fails, and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.680
now we have three wrong results in
our vote, we can no longer correct

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.230
that and we can get the bye-bye
space shuttle scenario.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.955
So the idea Is if we got one vote wrong,
we know we can tolerate more than that

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:11.545
without any problems, so
we would just continue normal operation.

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:13.115
These missions are expensive, so

00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:18.505
really if there is a single failure we
want to be able to continue normally.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:23.690
Another one happening after the first
computer has had a problem, is a very

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.450
rare occurrence, and we would abort the
mission because now we have some time

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.570
to safely land the space shuttle while
we still have three functioning modules.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.385
If it ever gets to another
one failing after that,

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:41.525
we can no longer promise that things
will be correct and at that point,

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:46.095
we are risking the astronauts' lives and
possibly some people on Earth, too.

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:48.765
So that's why the mission gets
aborted before this happens.
