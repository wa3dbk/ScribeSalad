00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.410
Network first tries to handle the
request by fetching from the network.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.462
If the network requests fails or

00:00:07.462 --> 00:00:11.230
times out, it will try to fulfill
the request from the cache.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.840
This is the strategy to use for
basic read-through caching.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.720
It's also good to use for API requests
where you always want the freshest data

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.500
when it's available but would rather
have stale data than no data at all.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.470
This method does have its flaws though.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.580
If the user has a intermittent or

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.680
slow connection, they'll have
to wait for the network to fail

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.080
before they'll get the perfectly
acceptable content from the cache.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.330
This can take an extremely long time and
is a frustrating user experience.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.710
Network first is ideal for
content that is updated frequently and

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.420
not part of the app shell.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.900
For example article content, social
media timelines, and game leaderboards.
