00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.850
Even though we center our discussion of
accessibility on users with impairments,

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.400
we can all relate to the experience
of using it to interface,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.050
which is not accessible to us.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.120
Have you ever tried to use a desktop
optimized site on a mobile device, or

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.840
seen this content is not
available in your country when you

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.910
are trying to watch a video online?

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.900
So in a broad sense you've
almost certainly experienced

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.480
being unable to access something.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.650
As we mentioned, this cause is
largely concerned with accessibility

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.260
in the narrowest sense of ensuring users
with disabilities can access content.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.130
However, addressing accessibility
issues in the narrow sense

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.258
very often improves the user
experience for everyone.

00:00:38.258 --> 00:00:39.230
To see where that's true,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.220
let's look at an example with
some accessibility issues.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.082
This form have several.

00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:47.720
The user name text and some of the text
in the price details is low contrast.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.430
So that's hard for
low vision users to read.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.390
Having the form labels on the left and
the form fields on the right,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.430
makes it hard for most people to
associate them and almost impossible for

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.340
someone who needs to
zoom in to use the page.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.209
And this label isn't correctly
associated with the check box.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.000
So I have to tap or

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.060
click this tiny square, rather than
being able to click the label.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.270
Plus a screen reader user would have
difficulty figuring out the association.

00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:18.290
So now let's wave our accessibility
wand and see with those issues fixed.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.170
We've made that low contrast text DACA.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.390
We've modified the design so

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.290
the labels are right next
to things they're labeling.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.620
And we fixed that label to be
associated with the check box.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.760
So now I can check and uncheck it
by clicking anywhere on the label.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.860
I'm much more comfortable actually
using the accessible version.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.320
Sure, I could probably get
by with the old version.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.970
But it would cause some extra stress and

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.900
possibly cause me to make mistakes
if I was in a hurry or distracted.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.800
True story, I once accidentally had
something shipped to me in San Francisco

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.880
instead of my parents in Australia,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.040
because of a form that looked a lot
like the previous one we just saw.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.230
So while we want to address
accessibility first and

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.610
foremost to avoid excluding
people from accessing things,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.100
it certainly isn't a zero sum game.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.720
We're more likely to
make things better for

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.710
everyone by addressing accessibility.
