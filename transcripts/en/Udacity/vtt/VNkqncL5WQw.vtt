00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's check our individual hypothesis.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So double quotes are always stripped from tag input.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, here's double quotes. They're stripped. This is correct.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Next, tags in double quotes are not stripped. Well, if we have tags over here, they are stripped.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If they are in double quotes, they are not stripped. So this is correct as well.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The tag bold is always stripped from the input. Not the case. Let's see over here. So not correct.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And four-letter words are stripped--well, actually we don't know this

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
because we don't have a four-letter word in here, but at this point,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
there's no reason to believe that four-letter words would be stripped.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You can still try this out yourself.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
What we have now is two hypothesis which are consistent with our observations so far.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
These maybe two separate issues, but chances are that they are actually tied to each other.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's focus on the first hypothesis because it's simple.
