00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.220
After recapping the three major issues that characterize a software crisis

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.626
let's see what was the evidence that there was indeed a

00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:07.900
crisis. So what I want to discuss now is the result

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.060
of a study performed by Davis in 1990s. So in even

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.670
more recent times than the 60s and the 70s. And the

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.280
study was performed on nine software projects that were totaling a

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.990
cost around $7 million and I'm going to show you how this

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.190
projects went using this representation, this pi representation, in which I'm

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.520
going to discuss what each of the segment of the

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.010
pi represent. So let's start looking at the first one.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.920
This is a software that was usable as delivered. Other

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.590
software was delivered, and usable, either after some changes or

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.080
after some major modifications, so within additional costs involved.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.530
But the striking piece of information here is that the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.890
vast majority of the software, so these two slices, were

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.250
software that was either delivered but never successfully used or

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.730
software that was not even delivered. And this corresponded

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.500
to five over the seven total million dollars for

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.050
all the projects. So clearly, this shows a pretty

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.910
grim picture for software development and its success. In short,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.410
there was clear evidence the software was becoming to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.990
difficult too build and that the software industry was facing

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.190
a crisis. And this is what led to the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.130
NATO Software Engineering Conference that was held in January 1969,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.100
which is what we can consider the birth of software engineering. And what

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.080
I'm showing here is a drawing of the proceedings for that conference. And if

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.020
you look at the class notes you can see a link to the actual

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.640
proceedings, in case you are interested in

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.180
looking at the issues that were discussed.
