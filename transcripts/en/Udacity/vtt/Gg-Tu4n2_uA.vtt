00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
As easily seen, the mean is 0.6. Hope you got that right.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The variance ends at 0.24, surprisingly it's 0.6&lt;i&gt;1-0.6&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and determine the right here is 0.0304 in approximation.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And that means with a thousand samples, we are really confident that the mean is 0.6

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and we are only willing to consider a deviation of 0.03.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now I ask you, do you think this gets evidence that this is a fair coin?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You'd say absolutely no because the confidence interval is so small.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is where the square root of N really helps us really drives the size of the confidence interval down.

00:00:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The more the sample size, the better for us. The more confident we are in our result.
