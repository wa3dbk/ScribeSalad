00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.840
My name is Don Dini. I'm a principle data scientist here at the AT&amp;T big

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.130
data group. My background is in computer

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.170
science in artificial intelligence specifically multi agent systems.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.190
Before that, I did physics but then I got, I got struck over the head

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.390
with the magic of computer science. And I

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.020
moved into there, and into our visual intelligence.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.220
And then I taught for a while at USC, and then

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.900
moving up here to the Bay area and worked for a couple of start ups. Doing a lot

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.700
of work on real time system for collecting data

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.950
and doing real time analysis on them. And and now I am here.
