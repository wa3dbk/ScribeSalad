What did you get David?

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.890
&gt;&gt; So
this is a little bit more complicated.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.260
We know that from our earlier
formula if a implies b,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.800
then to rewrite it with implicational
elimination we write, not a or b.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.690
So or b is pretty straightforward,
or bird.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.400
We take the not of
the conjunction over here and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.270
say not has wings and not has fur.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.180
Now some of you may have jumped
straight to writing this in full

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.670
conjunctive normal form, but now we're
going to move on and do that last step.
