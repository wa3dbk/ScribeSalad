00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.730
Let's have a closer look at how methods are described in javadoc. Here is an

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.190
example. Before the parenthesis you have the name of the method, in this case

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.170
pixels. Before the name, you have the type of the return value. In this case,

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.338
that's int because the pixels method returns the number of pixels in an image

00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:24.920
as an integer since you can't have half a pixel. Let's look at another example,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.310
the grow method. Again, the name is before the parentheses and before that is

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.420
the return type but in this case, remember the grow method doesn't return

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.790
anything and we use this special word void to denote that. Void means that

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.060
nothing is returned. Now this method call has another feature. It describes

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.160
what kind of arguments to pass. You call this method with two arguments and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.450
here you find the types you can grow by any decimal number. It doesn't have to

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.730
be an integer. Now actually and that's a minor detail, that you don't really

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.735
need to think about until the next lesson. What you see inside here, the double

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:13.090
dw and the double dh are themselves variable declarations. They declare two

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.690
variables that are called the parameter variables. Like I said, right now you

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.220
don't yet have to worry about the parameter variables but when you see the word

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.670
parameters in javadoc, then you'll know where that comes from. Now you know all

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.300
the technical terms that you need to decipher a javadoc documentation.
