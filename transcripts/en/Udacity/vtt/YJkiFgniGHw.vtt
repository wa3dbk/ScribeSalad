00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.834
To do this, we would find the square deviation of each value from their

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:11.415
respective mean. 1.5 minus 1.5 squared, plus 1.3 minus 1.5 squared, plus 1.8

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:22.030
minus 1.5 squared, etc., all the way to 2.7 minus 2.875 squared. This give us

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.219
.836.
