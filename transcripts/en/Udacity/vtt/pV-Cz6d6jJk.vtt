00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.880
So, coming back to our atomic instructions, we have

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.546
seen that we can have an atomic exchange, where the

00:00:05.546 --> 00:00:08.274
problem was that it keeps writing to the lockvar even

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.700
when it's not available. Our test and write class of

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.194
instructions, is trying to avoid that. By testing the

00:00:15.194 --> 00:00:18.142
memory location, and only writing to it if they find

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:21.528
a zero there. And we might implement a log, with

00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:25.488
a test and store, for example, instruction, we will implement

00:00:25.488 --> 00:00:28.080
a log by setting R1 to 1, then testing log

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.670
variance storing R1 there. And the result we get from this

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.250
test and store, let's say 0 in R1 means that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.290
the lockvar was occupied. In which case, we will just repeat

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.130
this, try this again and again. But the idea is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.080
that, as long as the lock is occupied, this test and

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.450
store is only reading the lock variable, it is not writing

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.582
to it. This is good, because remember coherence. If you keep

00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:53.530
writing, you keep invalidating all the other copies. So,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.610
everybody that is waiting, keeps generating bus traffic because

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.305
they're all trying to write, and thus invalidating each

00:00:59.305 --> 00:01:03.118
other. In contrast the test and store, everybody that is

00:01:03.118 --> 00:01:05.870
waiting while the lock is occupied, simply gets to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.310
share the lock variable. They are all having it in

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.055
the shared state and simply ro, and simply iterating

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:15.840
on their cached copy. Once the lock has been freed,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.716
those shared copies are invalidated, because the unlock, writes

00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:22.716
to the lock variable. At this point, everybody sees

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.790
the new value and tries to grab the lock,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.901
so there's really only communication on the lock, when the

00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:31.342
lock becomes free, until somebody acquires it again. So

00:01:31.342 --> 00:01:34.026
this test and write approach, solves the problem of

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:37.381
continuously writing to the lock variable, but doesn't really

00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:40.750
solve the problem of, this is a really strange instruction.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.650
It's neither a store nor a load. It

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.725
would be ideal for processor design, if we could

00:01:46.725 --> 00:01:49.425
do something that is very much like a load,

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:52.200
and very much like a store, yet behaves this

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.420
way. And that brings us to the third

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.660
type of atomic instructions, which are really now two

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.074
instructions. The special load, and a special store, that

00:02:02.074 --> 00:02:06.130
are somehow linked together, to create an atomic instruction.
