00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.060
So now let's try to figure
out a RAID 5 array.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.640
So now we have a RAID 5
array with five disks.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.260
One disk is still the same as before,
200 GB, 10 MB/s, MTTF of 100,000 hours.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.430
And again, we replace a failed
disk when it fails, and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.060
it takes us 24 hours to do that.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.050
So then our five-disk RAID 5 array
has what data capacity in gigabytes?

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.382
What throughput in megabytes per second,
assuming that we do

00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:33.880
half-reads half-writes, assuming that
half of our requests are reads and

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.610
half our requests are writes, and what
is the entity F for the array in hours?
