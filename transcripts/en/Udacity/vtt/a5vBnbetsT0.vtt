Congrats, you've made it to the end
of the Beginning Ruby content.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.160
At this point, you've seen all
the basic components of Ruby,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.620
all of the important bits of syntax
like variables, methods and classes.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.710
You've mastered the fundamentals
of the language.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.170
So what's next?

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.130
Well, in this lesson, we're going to
focus on those potential next steps.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.240
In particular, we'll talk about things
like web development, databases, and

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.210
frameworks like Ruby on Rails and
Sinatra.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.968
