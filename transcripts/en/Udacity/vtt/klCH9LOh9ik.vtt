00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.674
Grant is finally on the plane on his way to the Expo. He's curious about how far

00:00:04.686 --> 00:00:09.512
his plane is traveling though. He's not super familiar with the geography around

00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:14.268
the city where the Expo is, it's called something like Udacity, maybe its called

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.099
Udacity. Hm, I don't know. However, he does know that Udacity is about 700 miles

00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:23.616
north of some other city that he knows a bit more about, and that city's only

00:00:23.628 --> 00:00:28.984
about 200 miles east of his town. To help him visualize the most efficient path

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:33.171
for the plane to take, Grant wants to draw a picture, but a picture that's a bit

00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:37.109
more exact than the silly one I've drawn right here. If we say that Grant's

00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:41.138
hometown is located at the origin on some coordinate plane, and we split our

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.374
coordinate plane up into chunks of square miles, what should the coordinates of

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:48.143
Udacity be, and the coordinates of the other city be?
