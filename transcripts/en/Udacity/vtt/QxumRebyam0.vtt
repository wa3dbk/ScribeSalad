To continue our discussion on stereotypes, we're going to go back to Dr Markie

00:00:03.112 --> 00:00:07.440
Blumer, who you may remember from the motivation and emotions lesson. She's

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.781
going to talk about gender stereotypes. Can we talk a little bit about how

00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:14.462
women and men may be discriminated against, because of their sexual behavior?

00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:18.638
&gt;&gt; Right. So, actually this idea of sort of what we would call maybe gender

00:00:18.638 --> 00:00:22.994
stereotypes around sexuality and sexual behavior for both men and women, they

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:29.230
do lead to discrimination. women being people who tend to hold less power in

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.434
places pretty much all over the world. that isn't different in terms of sexual

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:38.878
contact so, they've typically had less power. What I mean by that is that

00:00:38.878 --> 00:00:44.160
they've had less of a voice. Less freedom around their sexual behaviors,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.864
practices, their beliefs, as well as their dress. Sexual stereotypes and gender

00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:54.220
stereotypes actually hurt both people. so, just as women have been confined or

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.188
relegated to certain positions in terms of sexual stereotypes and gender

00:00:58.188 --> 00:01:04.144
stereotypes. Things like if they dress a certain way then, then they are

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:10.166
expecting to have people, flirt with them or hit on them. Or, or they should

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:15.102
you know, engage in sexual behavior because they're dressed certain way. So,

00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:19.538
they are asking for it. Those types of practices are again ways that women's

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:23.630
gender and the expectations men and women have of their gender around sex have,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.855
have harmed them. There's been a lot of discrimination, a lot of pain and

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:34.111
suffering associated with that for women. women enjoying sex have been called

00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:39.023
all sorts of names. Women who have more sexual partners than men have also been

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:44.461
called all sorts of names. Really harmful things. Lots of shaming that's taken

00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:49.477
place. but if you look at those stereotypes for men, it's also pretty bad. The

00:01:49.477 --> 00:01:53.460
differences that they typically have more power in society. So, they aren't

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.682
harmed in quite the same way. But there are stereotypes that also do affect

00:01:57.682 --> 00:02:01.997
them, things like men should want to have sex. They should want to have sex

00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:05.754
with lots of people. if they don't want to do these things, then they're not

00:02:05.754 --> 00:02:10.023
really a man, and there's something wrong with them. And they get called all

00:02:10.023 --> 00:02:14.497
sorts of names as well, typically names that are pejoratively feminine. so,

00:02:14.497 --> 00:02:19.970
again that's denigrating to women and men. but definitely, people of, of

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.650
genders, men and women genders, have been harmed by the stereotypes that exist

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.306
around sexuality for both of them. And we really all have to work together to

00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:34.200
understand that all people regardless of their genitalia and their gender

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.917
identification, have the right to be self loving and loving of each other in

00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:44.159
sexual manners if they have the freedom a desire to so choose to be.
