So, we'll start with a quiz. It's kind of a trick quiz. The

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.550
question is, what's the longest word in the English language? If you're not a

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.030
native English speaker, don't worry. This quiz is just as hard for the native

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.387
English speakers as it is for you. And, here are the choices:

00:00:14.387 --> 00:00:21.526
honorificabilitudinitatibus, antidisestablishmentarianism,

00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:25.761
hippotomonstrosesqvipedaliophobia,

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:33.720
pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, or none of the above.
