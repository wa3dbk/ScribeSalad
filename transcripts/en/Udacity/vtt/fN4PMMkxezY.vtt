00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.435
I find that it helps me to break these down. So I'm going to start with just

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:07.670
imaging printing the first row. This for loop might seem a little bit silly,

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.582
but once I write it, I can compare it to the one for the second row. For each

00:00:13.582 --> 00:00:16.942
column, I want to print out a pair of square brackets, but in this case, the

00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:22.200
columns start at the first column and only go up to the first column. So

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.393
that'll look like this. The for loop for the second row will look pretty

00:00:25.393 --> 00:00:30.450
similar except it'll print two pairs of brackets. One for column 1, one for

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.000
column 2. So this is interesting, instead of something changing inside the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.040
loop, it's the actual loop condition itself that's changing form row to row.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.377
The threshold is actually the row itself, now these are exactly the same. So I

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:47.379
could set row to 1 and do this and then increment row to 2 and do the exact

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.365
same thing. Which means that I can put this code into a loop. So I'll indent

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:57.305
it, remove the extra repetitions and now instead of just setting row to 1, I'll

00:00:57.305 --> 00:01:04.152
actually loop over all of the rows starting at 1. And going while row is less

00:01:04.152 --> 00:01:10.149
than or equal to the total number of rows. Let's see how much progress we've

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.023
made after fixing typos. Well, it's certainly printing some brackets. Let's put

00:01:15.023 --> 00:01:22.474
some line breaks between the rows. Much better. This was kind of neat. In this

00:01:22.474 --> 00:01:27.028
problem, we used the outer loop variable to control the number of iterations in

00:01:27.028 --> 00:01:31.774
the inner loop. The loop condition of the inner loop depends on the loop

00:01:31.774 --> 00:01:34.330
counter variable for the outer loop.
