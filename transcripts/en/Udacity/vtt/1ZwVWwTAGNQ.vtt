00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.533
Let's look at a problem involving changing a number. We decrese a number by 7,

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:09.368
multiply the result by 3, and divide the final amount by 2. Let's get started by

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.662
finding out what these words mean. Let's translate them into an expression.

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:17.628
Notice that we have some unknown number, we're going to call that a. What do you

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.998
think? What's the expression that could represent the operations we performed?

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.295
Choose the best answer.
