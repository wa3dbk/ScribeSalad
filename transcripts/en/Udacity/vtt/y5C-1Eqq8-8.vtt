&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now let's talk about x instead of 2x. Thinking about what answers you got in

00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:09.099
the last quiz for the interval that 2x lies in, what do you think the interval x

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.254
will lie in will be? Just as a hint, if you want to check your solution on a

00:00:13.254 --> 00:00:17.798
number line, when you plug in your values of x to 2x minus 4, the opposite value

00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:24.095
of that should still be less than 6. So, be sure to check your answers.
