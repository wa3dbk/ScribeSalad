00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.726
We've done some simple code at this point, to load assets and resources in

00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:08.194
memory. But as our code base gets more complex, we'll quickly find that we need

00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:11.722
additional power and flexibility to help us get larger amounts of data into

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:18.870
memory. For example, what if you issue a load of the same file multiple times.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.550
Well, each load will hit disk or at worst the web, and load that asset into

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.744
memory. This can become a large performance burden as each from disk fetch can

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:31.258
have performance costs. As an improvement, it would be great if once an asset

00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:34.110
had been loaded, to know if it's in memory already, so that we can return the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.916
in memory version, rather than going back to hitting the disk, or the web,

00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:42.190
multiple times. This concept starts us down the path of an asset loading

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.519
manager, which we'll cover in this unit. Now in contrast to other languages

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.423
which handle File I/O as a synchronous or a blocking functionality, all File

00:00:50.423 --> 00:00:56.110
I/O functions in JavaScript are by definition asynchronous. As you already saw

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.334
before, we specify a load function that is called later, once the image has

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:03.050
been loaded. This is a benefit to JavaScript, because we don't have to put

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.802
together all the logic of communicating between threads in order to load our

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:10.699
assets asynchronously. Giving HTML5 an edge in terms of features for gaming.
