00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.880
Before you answer questions about all that you've learned so

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.660
far, I want you to hear from Scott and Cole again.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.610
They're going to share some amazing resources so

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.030
that you can create great data visualizations.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.190
What tools or resources would you recommend that students use?

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.500
&gt;&gt; There are things like D3, right.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.620
There are like JavaScript libraries and these tools that are built.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.290
To help you build totally customized visualizations.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.870
So that's sort of like on the advanced end.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.940
On the other hand you have tools that are a little more like create, kind of

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.570
create a canned visualizations like a chart wizard built into Microsoft Excel.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.760
&gt;&gt; Mm. &gt;&gt; Or.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.370
Or also like OpenOffice or LibreOffice, like these other sort of office type

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.660
programs, which are really great, or Apple's Numbers does more things.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.230
Tableau I think is a fantastic tool for starting out and they just came out with

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.700
a Mac version, which is great, as it opens it up to a lot of us who use Macs,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.250
and Tableau, I, I don't want to say it makes like, they're not like

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.390
canned visualizations but it let's you just like, really fast, drop a data set on

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.960
there and give yourself like a number of visual representations of that data.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.630
So you're like, oh show me this as a bar chart.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.340
Show me, to me as a area chart, line chart, whatever.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.260
Or if this is geographic data like, show me this data on a map.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.460
Like in a really fast way.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.100
So that's an awesome, sort of like exploratory tool and on the technical side,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.200
you know, there's like the other end of the spectrum from D3.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.190
Now in-between, there's a lot of stuff in-between like other chart libraries or

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.270
online tools.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.240
The tools I think I'm excited about right now are sort of in this.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.830
In between place where, where they

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.300
let you sort of dump your data in and generate some sort of visualization.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.810
But it's not trying to be the final visualization.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.170
And then you export that, bring it in to some other tool, and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.890
start adjusting it.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.840
So for example there's a tool out of the Density Design Lab.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.440
In Italy called RAW.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.886
&gt;&gt; Hm. &gt;&gt; That's capital R-A-W.

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:01.540
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.520
&gt;&gt; And you put some, basically drop your data on it and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.229
it figures out sort of this is a representation I think will work.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.060
But it doesn't give you, and, and it's all, like ,in one page.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.190
It's kind of like one, two, three.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.360
You just go down this list and then you get, like, a graphic of some sort.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.720
And then you take that graphic, and you export it, and maybe bring it into

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.970
Illustrator, or some other program where you can do kind of the manual steps.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.660
So then you can say, oh can we not set my, my fills and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.680
strokes and then reposition things.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.100
I think that's like, really nice and

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.380
really powerful, because it, it doesn't involve any coding.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.720
It doesn't involve a steep learning curve.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.100
And it also doesn't burden you with an interface that gives you a million like,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.360
options for customization.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.010
&gt;&gt; Mm. &gt;&gt; It's just saying I'm just going to get you started and

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.050
like get you past that initial push so you have this one graphic and

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.570
then you can take it and tweak it.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.699
So there's a lot of exciting stuff like that I think that you can use.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.320
So what tools or resources would you recommend for students who are getting

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.740
started be it maybe it's a blog or a particular software tool that you use.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.930
&gt;&gt; Sure so when it comes to tools I think my number one piece of

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.760
advice is try not to let your tool be a limiting factor.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.190
&gt;&gt; Mm. &gt;&gt; Right. Take the tool that you know and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.950
get to know it as well as you can.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.030
Most tools can be bent to meet your needs and

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.480
you can add more tools to your repertoire over time.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.020
But, the knowledge of fancy tools need not be a barrier for entry in this space.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.550
I, for example, do almost all of my work in Excel.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.220
Because, it's still the most pervasive for business communications,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.760
which is where I spend the majority of my time.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.540
When it comes to other resources out there, there is a wealth of information in

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.610
the blogosphere, an a lot of really great content.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.920
One word of advise, is there's a lot of not great content as well,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.180
so be a discerning.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.500
Purveyor of data visualizations, right?

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.580
When you come across a graph in a newspaper or

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.120
in a blog, study it and note what you like and what you don't like.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.710
And work to emulate those things that you see in other people's work that works

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.090
well and avoid the bad.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.490
When it comes to some specific blogs that I'd recommend, and

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.230
again there are a whole lot of good ones out there, but

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.180
I'll go through just a couple of my favorites today.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.440
First off is the Functional Art.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.920
So this is done by Alberto Cairo,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.519
he has a book of the same name that we talked about briefly.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.330
Next is Visualizing Data which, which Andy Kirk runs.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.220
Flowing Data is Nathan Yau's blog and

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.870
he curates a lot of stuff that other people do and.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.930
Yeah, another good example.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.760
And then I would be remiss not to mention my own blog at Storytelling with Data.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.690
And actually one more resource while we're flipping through pages here

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.430
is John Schwab's Help Me Viz.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.090
So we talked earlier about seeking feedback.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.400
This is a place where you can actually submit data visualizations and

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.960
get feedback from the community and has been growing and

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.510
has some really good content.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.480
Also if you're interested in just looking for data visualizations and

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.800
examples of good stuff and bad stuff, it's, a nice place to flip through.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.300
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.
