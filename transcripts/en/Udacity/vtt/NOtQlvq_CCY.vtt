00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.550
Hey, Jess.
Really nice job

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.060
helping them with the data structure.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we wanted to create a word
class that has both translations for

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.070
the English and Miwok of the same word.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.710
&gt;&gt; And this is like the floor plan or

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.900
the blueprint analogy we
used in the last course.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.574
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
And so from the same fore-plan,

00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:16.452
we could create many
different word objects.

00:00:16.452 --> 00:00:17.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.518
[SOUND] Like this.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:22.310
This is a word object which
represents the number one.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.890
And inside the word object we
have two string variables.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.363
A string variable for Miwok translation
which is luti, and a string variable for

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.580
the English translation which is one.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.855
&gt;&gt; And because this word object
was created from this word class,

00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:36.020
it's going to have these two methods.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.525
So, the getMiwokTranslation method.

00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:38.836
&gt;&gt; Which will translate this string.

00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:40.333
&gt;&gt; And getDefaultTranslation method.

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.644
&gt;&gt; Which will translate this string.

00:00:41.644 --> 00:00:42.888
Okay, cool.

00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:44.490
That sounds good.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.380
&gt;&gt; All right, so from the same
fore-plan, we can create more and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.850
more words.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.760
So a word for two and a word for three.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.420
&gt;&gt; My gosh, how many words objects?

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.699
&gt;&gt; All right, so in the next class,

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.138
we're going to take a look at how
to write this class definition.

00:01:01.138 --> 00:01:02.760
&gt;&gt; Word.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.040
&gt;&gt; Or if you need help you can refer to
the simplified version of the TextView

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.825
class that we showed
you in the last course.

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:12.030
So, remember that we need to provide
a constructor for your word class.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.730
And the constructor just looks like
a method declaration, but the name of

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.710
the method has to match exactly the name
of the class, capitalization and all.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.570
So in this case, we have the capital
T for text and capital V for

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.490
view with no spaces, which matches
exactly the name of the class TextView.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.370
Also notice that the constructor
has no return type.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.929
Now looking more closely at
the constructor for the TextView class,

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.902
we see it has the public keyword here.

00:01:38.902 --> 00:01:42.291
And this public keyword says that
an outside class can access this

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:43.730
constructor.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.230
So for example,
an outside color like the MainActivity

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.660
can call this constructor
using the new keyword and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.440
pass in this input parameter to
create a new TextView object.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.950
So note that you can create
multiple different constructors for

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.280
your class that have
different input parameters.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.320
That way any outside color can create
a TextView object in a number of

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.910
different ways depending on what
input parameters they can provide.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.884
Now in the next lesson,

00:02:09.884 --> 00:02:13.850
we'll see firsthand how you can create
multiple constructors for a class.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.960
So as mentioned earlier,
these private and

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.330
public words are called
access variables.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.290
We first learned about
this in the last course.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.859
So they define who has access to
these methods or constructors or

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.260
even this entire class.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.770
If a method is marked private,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.880
then it can only be called
within the enclosing class.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.870
So if something is marked public, it
can be accessed from outside the class.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.380
So if the MainActivity wants
to create a new text object,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.830
then it can because this
class is marked as public.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.120
And it also has a public constructor.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.629
And if any of these variables or
methods here are public,

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.639
then the MainActivity can
call on those as well.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.750
All right, so here's a diagram from
the last course if you remember.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.870
If a TextView method
is marked as public,

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.660
we can access it from both within
the TextView class or from outside.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.440
So something like
the MainActivity could access it.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.320
In general, it's better to make
the variables of the app, so

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.510
those that control the state
of the object, to be private.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.750
This way you can expose
the public methods that modify or

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.400
access these variables.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.889
So these methods are called getter and
setter methods.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.600
And they give you tighter control over
how these variables are modified or

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.380
accessed.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.410
So for example, if these state
variables were marked as public,

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.250
someone could set it invalid
color value on the TextView.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.240
And this would cause an unexpected
behavior in your class and

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.740
maybe even cause your app to crash.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.260
Now in the other hand,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.780
if you have a private color variable
with a public setter method,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.110
you can check that the incoming color
is valid before updating the state.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.660
Now, go ahead and move on to the quiz
where you'll create the word class.
