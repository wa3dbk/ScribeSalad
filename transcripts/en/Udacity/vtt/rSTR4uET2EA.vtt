00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.170
Build tools aren't a new thing, but

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.240
web test specific build tools only
became popular a few years ago.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.470
The most simple build tool is
just a shell, or bash script.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.170
These scripts, with the .sh extension,
are just a series of terminal commands

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.670
or functions, and
can be executed from the command line.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.300
But working with the Penzi graphs, or

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.350
only updating files that have changed
are tricky tasks with just a shell.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.870
And this is where
the original build system,

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.950
make, comes in,
adding file management, and more.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.650
After make came build tools such as Ant,
Maven, and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.180
Gradle, all especially
popular in the world of Java.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.060
All of them have declarative tasks.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.800
But you need to use XML to drive them,
or

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.890
in the case of Gradle, a programming
language that you might not understand.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.210
But web developers
have a burning hate for

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.770
everything XML, with the only exception
of HML as an accepted flavor.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.960
And so came a new set of modern web
development focused build tools.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.105
Tools that would use a language that web
developers are already familiar with,

00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:57.675
JavaScript.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.157
Out of the JavaScript are node
JS based build tools,

00:01:02.157 --> 00:01:05.060
two have become very popular,
Grunt and Gulp.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.000
But why are these the popular ones and
what should you look for

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.560
in a build tool?

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.790
I thought you'd never ask.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.350
A build tool should be fast in
execution as there's need for

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.750
speed when iterating on a website or
app.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.448
We're used to changing a line or
reloading a page afterwards to see

00:01:20.448 --> 00:01:22.820
the changes instantly and
disrupting that flow is a no go.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.978
It should also be supported by a healthy
community that exchanges plugins that

00:01:26.978 --> 00:01:31.830
add functionality and answers questions
on sites such as Stack Overflow.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.160
With popular build tools such as Grunt,
chances are there's already

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.310
an answer to your problem, and
somebody else has had it before.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.510
Next, it's very important that even
if it comes with a lot of bells and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.280
whistles you can extend it with more and
custom functionality as you see fit.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.220
And finally, the tool should at best
already solve a few common problems

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.460
out of the box for it to be useful.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.310
Grunt, the currently most popular tool,
fulfills many of these requirements.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.915
It has a strong community and
a healthy plugin ecosystem.

00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:02.250
But Gulp,
the new popular kid on the block,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.710
has two significant
advantages over Grunt.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.690
It's built for speed and
can execute tasks in parallel,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.820
plus converts open files into
super fast streams internally.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.270
Gulp's task, use code over
configuration, which means that you can

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.309
just use normal JavaScript, and extend
or modify tasks that don't work for you.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.150
You might have already guessed it,
we're sticking with Gulp for

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.428
the rest of this course.

00:02:24.428 --> 00:02:26.160
But if your team or
company chooses Grunt or

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.730
a different system instead, fear not.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.590
Usually the concept of what work is done
in all of them is quite similar, and

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.270
many times the plugin exists for both.
