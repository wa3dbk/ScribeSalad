00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.719
The viewDidLoad function
can be very useful for

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.080
running code once our ViewController
is loaded in to memory.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.190
What about running some code right
before the view appears on screen?

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.506
For that,
there are two functions we can use.

00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:16.198
The viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear.

00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:21.172
WillAppear happens right before the view
and ViewController appear on screen.

00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:24.845
And didAppear gets called
immediately after the view and

00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:26.450
ViewController appear on screen.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.338
Remember, that the view and
ViewController are linked.

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:31.830
A UI ViewController and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.600
any subclasses of it have at least one
IBOutlet that always goes to a UI view.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.966
Here, we're going to use auto
complete to help us out.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:44.957
In the ViewController.swift file move
right to the bottom in the space

00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:47.560
directly above the last
closing curly brake.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.640
Start typing viewWill.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.170
You can see Xcode's auto complete
showing us the viewWillAppear function.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.170
It knows that ViewController is
a subclass of UI ViewController.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.700
It also knows in UI ViewController
there's a function you can override

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.570
called viewWillAppear.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.340
Clicking on this function
fills it in for us.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.870
Auto complete makes sure
that the function name and

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.970
parameters are correct and
that there's no typos.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.560
See the highlighted text
here that says code?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.060
Click on it.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.300
This is where we're
going to type our code.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.070
For now let's add the line,
viewWillAppear called.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.440
If we run this app by pressing the run
button we can see the print statement

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.850
being called when our
ViewController appears on screen.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.440
There it is.
