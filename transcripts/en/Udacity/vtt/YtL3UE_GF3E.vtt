00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.040
Several other principals proposed by Martin concern Reuse.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.510
One of these is the release Reuse Equivalency Principle

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.100
that says that the granules of reuse should be the granules of release.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.830
That is you should release your your software in such a way that the pieces can

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.550
be individually reused. Of course, reuse can take place at all levels so,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.010
what Martin is really suggesting is that we re, Release highly cohesive code

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.830
units. In particular, Martin suggested Java packages as a good unit of release.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.960
The converse of this principle is the Common Reuse Principle, also by Martin.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.850
Classes that aren't reused together should not be grouped together.
