People at the expo in the wonderful city, Udacity, love Grant's glasses wipers,

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.299
but they're also really looking forward to his nozzles coming out. In order to

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.883
ensure the success of his business, Grant wants to move into nozzle

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:16.043
manufacturing really soon but nozzles, which if you remember, are the things

00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:20.139
that spray cleaning solution onto the glasses They're a little bit harder to

00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:24.234
make than glasses wipers. He's going to need to buy new machinery in order to

00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:28.686
start manufacturing them. On top of having to purchase this new machinery, Grant

00:00:28.686 --> 00:00:32.586
will also have to pay for the materials that are required to make a single

00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:36.728
nozzle. These cost about $2 per nozzle. As always, Grant's on a pretty tight

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:40.823
budget and he'd like our help to figure out how much he should plan to spend on

00:00:40.823 --> 00:00:42.739
this new nozzle making machinery.
