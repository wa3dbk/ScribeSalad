00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.570
So now that we will update channel economics for direct sales,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.320
let's go take a look at what the channel economics would look like

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.550
if we were selling through an indirect channel, resellers.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:19.340
So as you could see, we still have the same cost of goods to manufacture the product as before, $33.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.890
Now, what's kind of interesting is if we will look at the R&amp;D, selling costs,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.700
and general administration cost, our R&amp;D might be the same and keeping the lights on the building

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.510
might be the same, but our selling costs are lower because we're selling through resellers.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.710
We still needed a direct sales person but this time instead of them talking to every possible end user,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.410
they are actually talking to a few number of resellers.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:53.270
So let's say instead of $20, our SG&amp;A, sales, general, and admin costs plus R&amp;D this time

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:02.290
is $15 rather than 20, and that the total of getting the product out the door is now $48.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:10.350
Just like before, our list price is $100 and in the store the end user expects maybe a 10% discount

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.220
and so the revenue to the sales channel this time, not to us, is $90.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.890
But this time, we have resellers and the resellers don't work for us.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.160
They're the ones actually selling the product, and they take the difference between $90

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.020
and let's say $70, which they're going to pay us.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.500
And do their profit is $20 for carrying, stocking, and reselling our product.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:52.670
And our profit is just $22 this time because we're selling through someone else.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.200
But remember, our costs were lower.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.710
So one of the tradeoffs in using what's called an indirect channel is that your selling costs

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.930
are lower but you're giving a big chunk of your profit to other people not part of your company.
