00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.387
With negative signs, reciprocals and exponents you want to be very careful. Math

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.538
requires a keen attention to detail. Let's look at a couple of scenarios when

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.789
we'll be working with negatives, so that way you can see what I mean. We have to

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:16.677
be careful. Here I know it's just 5 squared or 5 times 5, so I get 25. For

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.937
negative 5 squared, I have the whole quantity of negative 5 squared, so I write

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.562
the whole thing in parentheses twice, so I have negative 5 times negative 5. I

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:30.130
know a negative times a negative is a positive, so I get 25. Here I have to

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:34.900
remember back to my order of operations. Do exponents or the subtraction take

00:00:34.912 --> 00:00:39.838
precedence. I know exponents come first. Here I have a choice. I could have the

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.127
5 be negative, and then I can square it or I could square the 5 and then take

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:48.514
the negative. Remember back from the order of operations, we know exponents come

00:00:48.526 --> 00:00:52.454
first. So I'll have 5 squared and then I'll have it multiplied by negative 1.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.639
Oftentimes we don't show the multiplication here, but that's really what we

00:00:56.651 --> 00:01:00.747
mean. It's negative 1 times 5. This is why we have to be really careful about

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:04.879
what we need in math. That's why a lot of times we use parentheses, we want to

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:09.555
know if we're scoring in 5, negative 5, or if we're scoring a number and then

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:14.491
multiplying it by negative 1, they're all different. So for my answer I have

00:01:14.503 --> 00:01:19.549
negative 1 times 25, or negative 25, and finally 5 to the negative 2. Remember,,

00:01:19.658 --> 00:01:24.582
with negative exponents, we really do the reciprocal. So I'm going to have 1

00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:29.355
over 5 and that's going to be squared. So I have 1 5th times 1 5th, or 1 25th.
