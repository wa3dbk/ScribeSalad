00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] The answer is 5.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's step through each statement to see why.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first statement creates a new list.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's elements are 1 and 2, and makes the variable P refer to that list.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The next statement evokes append on P, passing in the value 3.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Append adds an element to the end of the list,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so after this the value that P refers to will include 1 extra element with the value 3.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The next statement uses the plus operator.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The operands to the plus are P, which we already have,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the new list containing the elements 4 and 5,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and remember what happens with plus; it doesn't mutate any of the inputs.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It creates a new list that consists of all the elements concatenated together.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That will be this 5-element list.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We assign that to the variable P, so now P will no longer refer to the list 1, 2, 3.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It will refer to this new list that has 5 elements,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and at the end of this, the len of P is 5, since there are 5 elements in P.
