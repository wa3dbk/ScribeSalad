00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.777
In the last lesson, we learned how to add and subtract polynomials. Let's

00:00:03.777 --> 00:00:07.792
continue building on that knowledge and try to multiply polynomials. You'll

00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:11.906
still need to remember how to work with exponents and the idea of like terms. If

00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:15.838
any of those gave you some trouble, I would go back and do some more review.

00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:19.874
Before we multiply polynomials, let's start with something a little bit more

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:21.715
simple. Let's try an area problem.
