If we are going to be talking about shifting parabolas around, we should

00:00:03.432 --> 00:00:06.966
probably have a sort of point of reference, a standard parabola that we can

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:10.526
compare all the parabolas to. So I'd like you to tell me what the simplest

00:00:10.526 --> 00:00:14.276
equation you can think of for a parabola is. I've already filled in the y equals

00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:16.903
part for you, so just fill in the rest on the right side.
