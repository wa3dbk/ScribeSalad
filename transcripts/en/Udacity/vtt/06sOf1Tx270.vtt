00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.420
Now you'll learn how to run queries to find

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.990
conferences that were created by a specific user. Remember that

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.050
each conference has an ancestor, and that the ancestor

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.300
is the profile entity of the user who created it.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.420
Here's how you creat a query to get all

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.490
the entities that have a particular ancestor. You just add

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.020
the ancestor function to the end of the query

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.640
creation. You need to specify the key of the parent.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.050
That is the key of the ancestor whose descendants

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.350
you want to query for. This kind of query is

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.620
called an ancestor query, but you could also think

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.860
of it as a descendant query that is because it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.850
gets all the descendants of a particular entity. So

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.990
conferences for example. You can get all the conferences that

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.610
were created by a certain user. So go ahead and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.610
add a new function in ConferenceAPI called getConfrencesCreated that returns

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.650
conferences created by the logged in user. So

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.440
again, the HTTP method is going to be post. And

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.700
this time, the user must be logged in because

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.650
you're trying to get the conferences created by the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.020
logged in user and define the function to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.230
return all the conferences that the user created. And

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.570
again test on localhost before you deploy to app

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.950
spot and run your query on local host first,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.810
because if you deploy direct to app spot the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.810
first, and then try to run the query for the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.530
first time, you're going to find it doesn't work. So

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.290
after you've defined and tested your get conferences created method

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.330
take a look at the code and come and answer

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.240
this quiz. What I want you to do is figure

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.670
out which is the right code here to complete this

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.460
statement to get all the conferences created by the user.
