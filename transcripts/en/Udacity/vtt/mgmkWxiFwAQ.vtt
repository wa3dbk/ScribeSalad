00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.154
Now compute the sum of squares for the within group variabilities. That's the

00:00:05.154 --> 00:00:10.704
sum of the squared deviations of each value from its respective mean. Remember

00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:17.184
that's the squared deviation of 2 from 3, 4 from 3, 3 from 3, 6 from 6, 5 from

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:23.423
6, etc. And then you sum all these squared deviations to get some kind of

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.960
measure for the variability for each sample.
