00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.340
LRVM is a classic systems research work.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.280
You understand what is the pain point for

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.558
system developers. Once you understand the pain

00:00:10.558 --> 00:00:13.340
point, then it becomes easy to think about

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.860
what solution you can bring to the

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.980
table to solve it pain point. Managing persistence

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.122
for critical data structures is the pain

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:24.020
point that is identified by the LRVM work.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.310
LRVM proposes using lightweight transactions, that is, a transaction without

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.380
all the heavyweight asset properties

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.600
usually associated with transactions in database

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.240
literature. And this lightweight transaction is going to give the needed

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.490
persistent semantics for designing robust subsystems that can tolerate crashes.
