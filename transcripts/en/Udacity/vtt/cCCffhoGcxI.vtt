00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.780
For example, let's take a look at a hypothetical set

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.240
of situations. Which of the following scenarios on a computer

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.460
with only Wifi can you detect without trying to make

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.690
a network connection? Can you detect if you have no connection

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.330
to the router at all? Can you detect if the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.750
router has no internet connection? Or if the router has an

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.660
internet connection but no DNS service? Can you test that

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.550
the router has a connection, but a proxy server is blocking

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.730
a particular site? And can you test whether the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.390
router has a connection but your web server is down?
