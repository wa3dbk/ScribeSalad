00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.379
We've seen a couple of cases of direct variation, so let's look at inverse

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.816
variation. Earlier we determined that the speed of a vehicle and the driving

00:00:08.816 --> 00:00:13.213
time were inversely related. If we drive really fast, then we don't need as much

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:17.630
time to get to our final destination. If a car takes 20 minutes to travel some

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.280
distance at 45 miles per hour, how long would it take that same car to travel

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.137
the same exact distance driving at 60 miles per hour? We want to be very careful

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:33.194
though. We don't want to use this proportion. This is for direct variation. This

00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:37.738
proportion would say that if we drive faster, then it would take longer to get

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:42.747
somewhere. But we know this is not true. We know if we drive faster, then our

00:00:42.747 --> 00:00:48.640
time spent driving decreases. So instead of doing this, we can flip this second

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.740
fraction over. If we flip the second fraction over, we can see that our speed

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.546
now would be decreasing. If we drive slower, then it should take longer amount

00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:03.585
of time to get there. This also fits with our notion of speed and time. If speed

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:09.362
increases, time decreases. Likewise if speed decreases, as in this case, then we

00:01:09.362 --> 00:01:14.190
know that we should expect to drive longer. Time increases. For inverse

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.877
variation, we always want to put the other quantity in the opposite position.

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:23.380
We'll need to flip the fraction that varies inversely. So what do you think, how

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.353
long would it take us to drive?
