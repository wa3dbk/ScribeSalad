00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.108
You've just seen how to step over each of these lines. But it didn't really

00:00:04.108 --> 00:00:07.126
show us where the program misbehaved. The hard part goes on in this

00:00:07.126 --> 00:00:11.164
countSyllables method. So we want to get inside it. For that we need to use the

00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:15.416
second step button, the step into button. Let me restart the program and do

00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:19.745
just that. Here we are again at the first line of the program, we enter the

00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:23.775
input again, we step over the constructor, and now, going to hit the step into

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:30.010
button, and that opens up the Word class. Then we have to look around a bit to

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.494
find the arrow. We're right now, here. Now we can keep stepping, and that gets

00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:39.480
us through the lines of countSyllables. So the point is, you use step to stay

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.830
within the same method, and step into to go inside a method. Now all that

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.130
stepping can get tedious and sometimes it's better to set more break points and

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.810
run the program at full speed until one of them gets hit. Let's practice that.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.474
You see this line where it says count plus plus? Set a break point by clicking

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:01.618
here and now go ahead and restart the program. You'll hit the first break point

00:01:01.618 --> 00:01:06.004
in main. When you hit it, click the Continue button. So that your program

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:09.660
continues at full speed. Supply the same input, and then your program will wake

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.155
up at this break point. Hit Continue again and keep doing that, and tell me how

00:01:14.155 --> 00:01:17.400
many times you get the this break point.
