00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.564
What we want to do now, is take into
account, these two updates to Grant's

00:00:04.577 --> 00:00:09.312
total future earnings. We know that the
first thing that happens, is that Mr.

00:00:09.418 --> 00:00:14.310
Belvedere will triple the orders that
Grant had initially. And then after that

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:19.195
tripling happens, a school orders one
wiper set and two nozzles for each of its

00:00:19.207 --> 00:00:24.406
150 students. So remember step one here
happens before step two. So taking those

00:00:24.418 --> 00:00:29.005
two things into account what is a new
equation for Grant's future earnings? So,

00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:33.679
in other words, how do we modify the
equation that we had before for his total

00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:38.799
future earnings, 84w+60n, to reflect these
two changes to the number of orders that

00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:43.803
he has, and therefore the amount of money
that he's going to make? Please choose the

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:45.446
best choice from these four.
