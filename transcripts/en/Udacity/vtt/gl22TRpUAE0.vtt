00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.497
So we've already factored out an x minus 2 from our original polynomial, which

00:00:04.497 --> 00:00:10.720
leaves us with this quadratic expression, x squared minus 18 x plus 82. Now to

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.122
find the last two factors of this cubic function we started out with, we need

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:17.146
to find the factors of what we have left over, this new second degree

00:00:17.146 --> 00:00:22.258
expression. Now, it doesn't look like we can just factor this. Considering I

00:00:22.258 --> 00:00:27.786
don't know anything that multiplies to 82, but adds to negative 18. So, I think

00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:33.144
we should use a quadratic formula. Remember that if we label the coefficients

00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:36.554
of a quadratic expression, a, b and c, then we can find zeros of that

00:00:36.554 --> 00:00:40.769
expression using this formula. I'll just leave it down here so you can use it

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.300
in the problem. So please do exactly what we were just discussing. Use the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.784
quadratic formula to find the roots of x squared minus 18 x plus 82. Enter one

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:53.693
of them in this box and one of them in this box.
