00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.847
The answer is 2 plus or minus the square root of 19, all divided by 3, or we

00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:09.511
could list this as 2 3rds plus or minus root 19 divided by 3. Either way we

00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:14.170
write it, these two solutions are correct. We get these answers by first making

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.966
the negative of b, so this will become positive 4. Negative 4 squared is 16,

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:24.580
and these numbers multiplied together are positive 60. We have negative 4 times

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.178
3 times negative 5. Because two of these signs are negative, we wind up with a

00:00:29.178 --> 00:00:33.349
positive product. This is where I mentioned a sign error usually occurs. You

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:36.216
want to watch out to see if you have an even number of negative signs or if you

00:00:36.216 --> 00:00:40.670
have an odd number of negative signs. We add 16 and 60 to get the square root

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.730
of 76, and then, we simplify the square root by breaking it down to 4 times 19.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.682
The square root of 4 equals 2, and then, we can split up 6 into 2 times 3. This

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:56.110
allows us to root a common factor 2 from each of the terms. We know 2 divides

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.296
into 4 two times, and 2 divides into 2 one time. This leaves us with 2 plus or

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:05.929
minus 1 root 19 in our numerator and positive 3 in our denominator.
