00:00:00.093 --> 00:00:01.861
So this first one is pretty easy, right?

00:00:01.861 --> 00:00:07.645
There is a 1-to-1correspondence between the output and the input, so that's clearly an app operation.

00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:10.748
And this next one is also is 1-to-1 operation.

00:00:10.748 --> 00:00:16.213
One value gets written in the output array corresponding to every value that gets read from the input array.

00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:21.406
And you can see that we're writing into an array which is represented in

00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:26.845
I major order here in the output, and in j major order in the input.

00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:31.900
So this is a transpose operation. Now this next code, as I said, I put a guard around.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.292
Only odd the numbered threads are going to execute this.

00:00:34.292 --> 00:00:37.005
So that rules out a map, it's not 1- to-1.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.325
And that also rules out a transpose operation, which is also 1-to-1.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:45.152
And you really couldn't call it a stencil operation either because a stencil operation

00:00:45.152 --> 00:00:50.282
should generate a result for every element in the output array, and this doesn't do that.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:55.034
Now if you look the first one, the thread is taking the input at a given location,

00:00:55.034 --> 00:01:00.442
and multiplying it by pi, and placing that into a couple of different places in the output array.

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:03.450
In fact it's incrementing a couple different places in the output array.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.795
So this would be a scatter operation.

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:09.745
The thread is computing for itself where it needs to write its result.

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:11.599
And this final line would be a gather.

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:15.118
You can see that every thread is writing a single location in the output array

00:01:15.118 --> 00:01:19.734
and it's reading from multiple places in the input array, locations that it computes.

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:21.371
So this would be a gather.

00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:26.656
And again, this looks very much like a stencil operation since it's reading from a local neighborhood,

00:01:26.656 --> 00:01:29.041
and doing some averaging, and writing the result.

00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:33.939
But I wouldn't call it a stencil because it's not writing into every location because of this guard here.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.053
So that's why I refer to this as a gather rather than a stencil.
