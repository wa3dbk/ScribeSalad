00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.680
The reason that this volume doesn't work is because it's giving us a negative

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.565
value. For a quantity that we should be able to touch and feel, it's tangible.

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:13.345
And length and areas and volumes are usually positive. Let's see if we can

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:17.440
figure out why by using a real piece of paper again. After all, this is the

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.480
right size, so maybe if we try to make this box, we'll figure out what's going

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.132
wrong. Here's my ruler and my piece of paper and I'm going to measure in three

00:00:27.132 --> 00:00:31.508
inches from each side and then in the other direction as well. Okay, so there's

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:35.942
one of the squares we should draw. Now let's draw the other three. Two squares,

00:00:35.942 --> 00:00:40.386
and now potentially for the tricky ones. So here's the issue we have when I

00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:44.810
tried to draw my boxes for the corners that I want to cut out. This length right

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.284
here is 3 inches, or x, the length of the square that I want to cut out. But you

00:00:49.284 --> 00:00:53.631
can see that if I started to cut here, and actually cut down the whole length,

00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:57.909
right there, I'm already cutting into an area that's supposed to be part of

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.894
another square that I'm going to, to cut out. This is a major issue. I'm not

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:05.798
going to have enough flaps left, or enough material left if I cut out all of

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:10.977
this. In fact, let's just do it to see what happens. Now I just have this strip

00:01:10.977 --> 00:01:15.212
of paper and I can't make a box out of this.There are no flaps. I guess this has

00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:19.646
something to do with what's going on. So for our 5 inch by 7 inch piece of

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:25.278
paper, what value must x, the cut length, not exceed in order for us to still be

00:01:25.278 --> 00:01:30.670
able to have flaps that we can fold up and make this into a box? Just think back

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.940
on what the problem was before with the 3 in cut length, and use your common

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.044
sense. This is kind of a riddle. So, just think through and take your time.
