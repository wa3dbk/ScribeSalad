00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.926
Factoring the expression on the left gives us x plus 45 plus x minus 10 times x

00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:09.559
minus 10 is less than or equal to 0. So our 2 critical values for x then that

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.636
are going to split up our number line are negative 45 and 10. Our interval then,

00:00:14.636 --> 00:00:19.692
that we get from these critical numbers are x is less than or equal to negative

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:24.527
45. Negative 45 is less than or equal to x, which is less than or equal to 10,

00:00:24.527 --> 00:00:29.409
and 10 is less than or equal to x. Here, we include the critical values in each

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:33.984
of these intervals, because we have a less than or equal to sign, not just a

00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:38.387
less than sign. We know that if x equals either of these critical values, the

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:42.876
expression will actually equal 0 and that means it definitely would satisfy the

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:47.031
inequality. So we want to test these intervals. We want to include those

00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:48.873
critical values in each of them.
