00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.530
So the objectives of this specific lesson is that I'm going to

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.580
introduce you to the concept of point processes.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.410
That is, how do you basically use pixel values themselves and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.090
use them in computations?

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.830
We will use this to do addition and subtraction of images but it can be used to

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.800
doing any other kinds of mathematical operations like multiplication.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.350
I'm going to use this also concept to introduce the concept of alpha values and

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.500
alpha blending.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.710
And how can we use some different types of simple image processing methods.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.910
And while we have talked about image histograms in the previous lecture,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.180
in this lecture I'm going, I'm going to give you a much better handle on how we

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.540
can use image histograms to look at the statistics of images and

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.091
how we can use them in different methods of computer vision and image processing
