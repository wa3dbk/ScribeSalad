5.45 divided by 3 is 1.82. And .836 divided by 16 is .052. The f statistic is

00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:17.763
the ratio between these two. And that gives us 35. This is so large that we

00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:21.930
already know we should reject the null. We know there's a signifigant

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.400
difference in tumor reduction between at least two of these groups.
