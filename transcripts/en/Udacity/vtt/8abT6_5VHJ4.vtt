00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.220
Okay, and the solution is like so. Gets is pretty simple.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.200
First we just call normal get on the cache, and if

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.700
there was a value, return that value plus hash repr v

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.100
which will just return a nice hash to the value for us.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.330
Now, here's the cas function. First we call gets. And if

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.930
the value is actually in the cache. We have our value in

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.058
our unique and then we compare the unique we got from

00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:25.300
our cache to the unique that was passed in and if they

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.200
match, we call set and we return the value of

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.343
set which in our case always returns true. Otherwise, we return

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:34.370
false. Simple enough. Let's go ahead and give this a test.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.350
Okay, first off I'm going to run the basic functions. No, it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.324
should print through one, none, none and then a [UNKNOWN] of

00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:44.730
two and our hash which in this case is this number

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.720
here and then it should print false. Because we tried to

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.380
overwrite x with the value three giving it the wrong hash.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.935
In this case zero. And now that we have our hash.

00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:56.550
Let's go ahead and paste that into here and see if

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.930
these next two statements run. Okay, so I click run again

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.810
and we can see that we're printing all the original command still

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.780
run, the hash is still the same. This cas command here,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.720
set x to three, with cache val, cache unique value zero,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.980
prints false. Because unique doesn't match, what it, what the unique

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.550
should be is this value here. And when we try to set

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.460
x to four we see true. And we get x we can see that it was probably set

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.230
to four. So that's how gets in cas works.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.730
They are built in the mem cache, you won't ever

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.140
have to implement them but now that you know

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.810
how they work. You'll be able to use them

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.040
in production that much better. And you have another

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.580
tool in your toolbox for dealing with complicated caching issues.
