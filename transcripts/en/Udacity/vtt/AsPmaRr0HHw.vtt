00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, in a world where basically that's all you do is you create demand on the left side of the funnel

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and somebody purchases on the right, you could kind of like measure how much it cost to do that

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then we'll talk about customer acquisition cost a little later, but there's a little magic accelerator

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on the bottom of this funnel, and that's called the viral loop.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
A viral loop could be something as simple as somebody bought one of your products in the store

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and could not wait to tell their friends--wow, this was the greatest thing ever,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
you can't wait to get them boom.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You now have kind of a magnifying effect, a viral effect,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
about selling your product based on users loving it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, this happened for a hundreds of years, but now we could sometimes engineer this viral loop

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
by saying--is there anything that we can do, any incentives, any ways to kind of get rebates,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is there a way to turn our customers into sales people to kind of accelerate this purchase

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to help us get new customers.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And Smart Startups think about this loop all the time, so viral loops are something

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that startups want to see if it's possible to create.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Now, just don't feel bad if in your company it's really not possible to do viral--

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
for example, in dating sites.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Not everybody wants to announce to their friends that they are actually visiting a dating site.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So in some cases it might not be possible, but in other you should always keep your eye out--

00:01:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
is it possible to make this funnel more efficient.
