00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.930
We're going to be building this app
in stages across four lessons in

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.170
this course.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.710
And we'll come back to this course map
periodically to track our progress.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.370
In lesson one we're

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.432
going to learn about how to show
multiple screens in your app.

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:14.720
We're going to leave the other screens
blank temporarily and dive into

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.440
the fundamentals of how Android
handles user touch events in your app.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.050
So in lesson two, we're going to
display a list of words in the app.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.310
We'll show the English and
Miwok translations for each word.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.130
And this involves
learning about arrays and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.360
lists, which are Java data
structures to store data in our app.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.200
Then in lesson three,
we're going to improve upon the list, so

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.730
we can show images in
the lists alongside each word.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.790
Once this functionality works,
we're going to make visual changes.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.580
Color, font style, spacing so

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.708
that the app looks more like
the design marks we are given.

00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:49.420
In Lesson four, we're going to add
the play icon to each list item and

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.760
learn about the media player in Android.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.910
So we had Andrew record audio files
on how to pronounce each MiWok word.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.780
So we'll play each MP3 file when
the user clicks on a list item.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.980
And at this point,
we have a fully functioning app.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.730
As we mentioned earlier,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.240
there are many ways to build this MiWok
language app, so we want to show you

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.070
another way to modify the app to
have a different navigation flow.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.380
In lesson five, we'll integrate all four
lists of vocabulary words into a single

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.380
activity, made of four different
fragments that you can swipe through.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.300
There are also tabs across the top, and

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.120
this is a common pattern in Android apps
that we thought you might find useful.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.620
For example,
the Google Play store uses this design

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.080
when allowing users to
browse through apps.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.710
So while the focus of this course is
on building a MiWok language app,

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.750
the skills you learn here can easily
be transferred to any other app.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.782
By the end of this course, you'll know
how to create a app with multiple

00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:45.010
screens, display lists of data,
play audio files, and

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.050
you'll become more comfortable with
Java oriented programming concepts.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.340
These fundamentals will help you
build more complex Android apps

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.990
with even better user experiences.
