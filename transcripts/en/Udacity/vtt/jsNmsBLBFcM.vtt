00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.770
The answer is 4. Let's think about this for a second. Let's say, for a moment,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.640
that our function had five linear factors, then we would have five linear

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.698
factors. Five factors of x minus some number all multiplied together. Now, when

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:18.640
we expand this multiplication, in other words, when we distribute all of these

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.175
factors to one another, we're going to end up with some term that has an x to

00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:27.436
the fifth power. That's no good. This is a fifth degree polynomial, not a

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:32.180
fourth degree. Considering this, you know that one of these factors have to go

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.914
away, in order for us to only have the polynomial of degree 4.
