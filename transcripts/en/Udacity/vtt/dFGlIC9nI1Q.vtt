00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.730
Okay, one last thing I'd like to look at before

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.440
we move on to some more advanced query topics. Is the

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.270
ability to specify a projection document in addition to our query

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.370
document for calls to find. Now, what projection does is it

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.370
essentially describes the shape we would like documents to take in

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.850
the result set. I'm also going to break this out a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.580
little bit here with the query and projection variable, and pass

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.140
those to find, instead of directly passing the dictionary that we

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.260
constructed to find. I point this out merely because we'll

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.360
see this later on in the lesson, and I don't want

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.850
anyone to be confused. Now, let's imagine that instead of getting

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.030
back all of the documents for our query specifying constraints on

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.730
manufacture and class, we actually are only interested in getting the

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.130
name of the document back. Well, we could simply print out

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.000
the name down here. But another way we can do that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.060
is by specifying a projection as a second parameter to find.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.180
And what that's going to do is say, all of the result

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.510
documents that come back, instead of having their full contents, I only

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.530
want to see name. No, by default, unless we explicitly say, I

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.209
don't want to see the ID field, we'll also get ID. So

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.590
that's why I've got ID set to zero here. Okay? So the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.960
way we do this, is, essentially, we specify all the fields for

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.880
the documents in this collection. And then specify whether or not we

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.580
want them to occur in a result set. Alright? Let's run this.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.720
Alright and here we can see that the documents

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.430
we get back simply have the name field in them.
