00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's look at a famous NP-complete problem that we didn't cover in the unit,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
called Hamiltonian paths.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now a Hamiltonian path involves visiting every vertex of a graph exactly once,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and here's an example.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's say we have the very simple graph shown right here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Well, in that case, a Hamiltonian path, if we start it here--let's say we'll

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
go to this vertex, then this vertex, then that vertex.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And that is a Hamiltonian path.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We visited each vertex exactly once.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now there is another NP-complete problem called a Hamiltonian cycle

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which is the same thing, but you have to start and end on the same vertex.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And that's actually impossible on this graph.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We can kind of start off here, but then, once we get here, there's no way

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to get back to our starting vertex.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So now let's take a look at a slightly more complicated example.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And what I'd like to know is whether this graph has a Hamiltonian path

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and, similarly, whether it has a Hamiltonian cycle.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Please check the corresponding box if it has either a Hamiltonian path,

00:01:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
a Hamiltonian cycle, or both.
