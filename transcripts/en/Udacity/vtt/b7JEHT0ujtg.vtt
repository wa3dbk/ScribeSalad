Let's see what actually got printed. Here's our terminal, and we can see the

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:12.100
first number, which was the original X value, is 5. The original width is 60,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.600
the next X value is 30, and the next width is 60. Since the X value changed

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.465
from 5 to 30. We know that translate is a mutator.
