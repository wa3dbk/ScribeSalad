The start symbol is S. It's the first one to appear in our grammar.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One possibility is s goes to ee which goes to ei using rule 2 and rule 4

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so this string is definitely in the language of our grammar.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I could also have picked rule 2 followed by rule 3, and then eventually this will boil down to ei plus i.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This string is also in the language of the grammar.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now, we have aib. Well, I can get the a and the b from this rule 1 here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But then if I don't want to make more a's and b's, I have to use this rule 2 to get rid of the s

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and that requires that I bring in this e, and there's no e in this string so that's not looking good.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
All right. How about this, aa, bb?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I can get that by looping around the first rule twice and then ei.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Yeah, this string is in language of the grammar.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Over here, I've got the a and the b around it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We'll note that these a's and b's follows the same balanced parentheses pattern

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we've been doing a few times.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The real question is whether ie plus can be generated from s.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We can get the e, we can get the i, but if we use the plus rule

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
it has to have an e on both sides so you know we really need another i in here

00:01:09.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but we don't have it so this string is not in language of the grammar.
