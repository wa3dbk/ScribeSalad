00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.370
So let's think about risks in managing partners.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.470
Well, the biggest one is what I call impedance mismatch,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.100
and again I've been talking about this a couple of times in this lecture.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.780
In a startup, you barely register on a large company's radar.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.360
In fact, you're entire company's staff is probably less than the administrative staff

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.450
of the CEOs of some of these companies,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.070
and the longest of the partners schedules become your longest item, and what does that mean?

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.640
I've seen many types, large companies say, well,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.660
we'll make that decision when we get to our plan and meeting

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.490
and any less, but when is the plan and meeting?

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.780
Oh we have that quarterly.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.250
Well quarterly 90 days to startup is like we make decisions in an hour and a half.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.140
And so now all of a sudden, the longest of their meeting

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.450
and decision schedules becomes your longest item and if you're working like startups should

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.830
on an intense speed and tempo, they are now slowing you down.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.370
The third thing is when you're using strategic alliances or joint ventures,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.760
there is no clear ownership of the customer, and in fact, if there is any owner

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.480
at all the large companies will say, oh you know, we have a thousand people in the field.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.560
Don't worry. We'll take care of this.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.200
But when you typically never realizes, your product to those thousand people in the field,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.880
might put a little asterisk on page 49 of their sells price list and again when you do joint ventures,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.830
that will make you sure who owns the vision because products by committee

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.140
are probably the worse thing that could happen to a star-up and your objectives tend to differ.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.900
You need to understand what happens in a large company when you become part of the partnership.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.070
Were you there as a check list item that someone said, oh we need one of this in our catalog?

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.100
Were you there for someone to career to look with or you absolutely essential for their success?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.670
Don't confuse big name company being interested in you with a potential liquidity event.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.930
Most of these partnerships fail, and one that isn't intuitively obvious is that a great person

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.160
who you are dealing with in that large company--

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.120
the odds are in 15 months, they're no longer in that job.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.980
Because if their career is heading in the right direction,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.800
they're going to be promoted or moved to another job or another division or another location,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800
and therefore, the person who is passionate about your relationship is now gone.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.690
So if there is no underlying rationale. If there's no real what's in it for them?

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.550
The turn in partners and strategies or personnel might put your company out of business

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.380
and then never notice the difference.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.300
You were just a short-term play for whoever was in the job

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.500
and if this was an important to their company though it might have been essential to yours,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.510
that deal is over even though you might have a contract.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.790
The other thing startups worry about is intellectual property issues

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.920
typically not much of an issue in the United States, typically a very, very, very--

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.600
more very's inserted to your important issue in dealing with China.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.800
Intellectual property and the rule of laws or trait, and trademarks, and IP

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.910
is not quite the same in the US as it is in China, Russia, India and other developing nations.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.100
You should make sure that you're not dealing with IP issues in these countries as you would in the US.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.730
Finally, these deals are difficult to unwind or end.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.100
This might've looked like a great idea when you were struggling startup.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.050
Eighteen months later, when you're revenues rolling in, you realized that you gave these large companies

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.420
or these joint ventures or the strategic partners resources or assets or other things,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.080
you never would've done two years later, and so we really think through,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.020
what happens 2 years from now?
