00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.831
Oftentimes you will want to gather input from a user and you'll give the user

00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:08.996
instructions such as, please enter a value less than 100. The user then may do

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:13.664
something wrong, as users sometimes do. So, here we have someone disregarding

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:19.000
the instruction and now what do you do? often times what you do is you simply,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.950
politely ask again and the user might still get it wrong not understanding that

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.593
less than 100 means less than 100. So, you'd ask again. And now finally, the

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:33.928
user gets it right. This is a very common situation, and it turns out to be

00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:38.635
surprisingly difficult to program. Here are two possible solutions to this, the

00:00:38.635 --> 00:00:44.274
blue one and the black one. And, I'd like you to look at both of them and see

00:00:44.274 --> 00:00:49.202
which one would work. Take your time, and tell me, is the blue one the right

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:53.719
one? The black one, do both work? Or does neither of them work?
