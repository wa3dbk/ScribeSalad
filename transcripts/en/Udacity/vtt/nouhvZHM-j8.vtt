00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now we have four questions about bipartite graphs.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The first question asked, what is the minimum number of edges needed to make B

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
have a single reachable component consisting of all the nodes where B is a five by three bipartite graph.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We know that trees are connected and that they have n-1 edges.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In fact, it takes at least n-1 edges to connect any graph within nodes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The question is, can we make B a tree?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And yes, they are lots of ways that we can make B into a tree. This is just one example.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
By this reasoning, we can see that it would take at least seven edges

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
needed to make B have a single reachable component consisting of all the nodes.
