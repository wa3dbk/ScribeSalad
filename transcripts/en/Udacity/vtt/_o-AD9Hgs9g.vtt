00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.820
So an important consideration
in what we're doing here

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.050
is that our state is a single number.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.850
It's an integer.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.660
That way we can address
it in our cue table.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.620
It is certainly the case that some
reinforcement learning methods

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.300
are able to treat the state
as a continuous value.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.970
But just to get started here,
let's use state as an integer so

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.560
we can work more easily with the data.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.220
Now we have to do a little bit of work
to get our state to an integer and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.380
here is the general way to do it.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.060
Our first step is to
discretize each factor.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.240
It's a weird word,
I'll explain it in a moment.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.696
But it essentially means convert
that real number into an integer.

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:48.021
Next is combine all of those integers
together into a single number.

00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:51.632
We're assuming that we're using
a discrete state space and

00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:55.948
that means more or less that our overall
state is going to be this one integer

00:00:55.948 --> 00:00:59.390
that represents at once
all of our factors.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.760
So consider that we have four factors
and each one is a real number.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.500
Now we have separately beforehand

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.610
figured out how to discretize
each one of these factors.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.530
So we run each of these factors through
their individual discretizers and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.600
we get an integer.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.620
Now I've happened to select
integers between 0 and 9 but

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:31.160
you can have larger ranges, for
instance 0 to 20 or 0 to 100 even.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.390
It's easy if we just go from 0
to 9 because then we can stack

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.420
them together into a number.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.500
But it's not too hard to think of
algorithms will enable you to combine

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.650
larger ranges of integers together.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.310
In this case we're just able to
stack them one after the other

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.630
into our overall discretized state.
