00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's a function "move" as a class function of the class robot

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that implements where I get my motion vector,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and the motion vector is defined to be steering first, then distance.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I have a few error checks here to make sure the steering doesn't exceed

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the max steering angle, and the same is true for distance.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I want it to be non-negative.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
As I go down, I now implement the motion model.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's just look a little bit more.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I make a new robot copy as in my sample code in class.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I copy all the narrowing parameters--length, bearing noise, steering noise, and distance noise.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Nothing surprising here.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Here I'll apply the noise, which you don't need it for the first implementation,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but later on as we go on, you need it to actually add noise.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I just add Gaussian noise with the corresponding steering noise and distance noise parameters.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If I set the mean of the Gaussian to be the steering command

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and the distance command then this adds noise.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I could have equally written steering plus random.gauss,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
zero, comma, and then the noise parameter.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
As I go down further, here is my execution of motion.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
My turning angle, I called "turn."

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is the tangents of the noisy steering

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
times the distance moved divided by the robot length.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
As in my explanation of this question, I'm going to branch and see if my turn is significant enough.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It's smaller than tolerance, and tolerance was set about to 0.001.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Then I just model a straight motion.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I get my new robot coordinates by the old robot coordinates,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
moving in the orientation of the robot--cosine for x and sine for y.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I increase my orientation by turn, which is likely essentially zero.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In case I go beyond 0 or 2π,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I do the modal operation here just to make sure my angles are nicely between 0 and 2π.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The more interesting case--as we go down

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
in this program you can see that I now calculate the radius

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
as the noise distance divided by turning.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Then I find the center of the circle around which I'm turning,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
using the exact same math I just gave you.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I now first change the orientation to be the new orientation

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
by adding turn to the old orientation, modal, or 2π.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Then I plug the new orientation into the sine and cosine argument,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
multiply by radius, add to the center of the circle to get my result.

00:02:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This routine over here gives me exactly what I wanted.
