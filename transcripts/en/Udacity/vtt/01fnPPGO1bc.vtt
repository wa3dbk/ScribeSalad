00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.730
What did you get, David?

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.440
&gt;&gt; So like before, because this is
an or, as soon as we see that A is true,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.189
we can go ahead and
write down true for all of these.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.090
When A is false,
we just need to evaluate B or C.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.490
When B is true,
we know it's already true.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.490
And then if B is false
we need to look at C.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.210
If C is true, then it's still true,
and if C is false,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.480
then all three are false and
that's the only time it's false.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Over here,
we've moved the parentheses but really,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.050
we're not changing what we do.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.860
We can think of it as stating
at the bottom with C being true.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.910
Anytime C is true,
the entire thing is true.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.600
So C is true here, here, here, and here.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.870
If that evaluates to false,
we need to look at A or B, and so on.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.050
So we end up doing
the exact same process.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.807
&gt;&gt; That's good, David.

00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:42.496
And this property is called
the associative property.

00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:46.614
The associative property
simply says that we can change

00:00:46.614 --> 00:00:51.255
the location of the parentheses here,
A or parentheses B or C,

00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:56.526
parenthesis close, has the same value
as A or B parenthesis close or C.

00:00:56.526 --> 00:00:59.330
So that we can change
the location of the parentheses.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.410
The same would have been true
if these were both conjunctions.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.355
So if it was A conjunction
parentheses B conjunction C or

00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:13.120
A conjunction B, conjunction C,
it would have had the same values.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.790
&gt;&gt; The difference between
these formulas and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.040
the ones we were doing before
are the values of these operators.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.996
Associative property works when
it's both ors or both ands.

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:27.280
Distributive property worked when
there was a mixture of operators.
