Let's begin with a discussion of the World Wide

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.240
Web. The World Wide Web is a collection of

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.400
HTML documents. These documents are made up of something

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.720
called HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language. This

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.180
is the basis for almost every webpage. Even though

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.240
there can be, you know, documents, images, videos, and

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.550
you know, all sorts of things online. HTML is

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.220
what glues everything together, and the links between these

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.840
pages called hyperlinks or links for short, is what makes the web, web-like.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.390
The web was invented in the early 1990s, and has something on the order of

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.700
30 billion pages. Time for the first quiz. What is the main type of document on

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.120
the web? Is it HTML, Microsoft Word documents, PDFs, or Plain Text?
