00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.770
In our next algorithm, we want to find the largest element in an array list.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.770
Again, let's look at the example of our pictures. We might want to know the

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.074
largest one, to know how much vertical space we need on the wall. Or maybe we

00:00:13.074 --> 00:00:16.546
want to center them all with respect to the largest one, then we need to know

00:00:16.546 --> 00:00:21.960
the largest one first. In this algorithm, we start assuming. That, the first

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.949
element, or rather the element at index 0, is the largest one. Then we look at

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.792
all other elements, and if an element is larger, by some measure, than the

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:34.824
largest element, then we change our mind, and now say the largest element, is

00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:40.847
the one that we've just seen. So in this example, for example, we would start

00:00:40.847 --> 00:00:45.530
off by saying, oh, the first one that we've seen, that's the tallest picture.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.602
Then we move onto the next one, and say that one is taller so I'm changing my

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:52.623
mind, and now this one is now the tallest. this one is even a bit taller, so

00:00:52.623 --> 00:00:56.477
that one must be the tallest. Now this one here is not as tall so we no longer

00:00:56.477 --> 00:01:00.590
change our mind. And the last one that was considered to be the tallest is in

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.465
fact, the one. Just like we've done before, I now leave it to you to implement

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:09.235
this code in Java, and this time I want you to actually draw the tallest

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.319
picture. Go ahead.
