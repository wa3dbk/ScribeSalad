00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, x equals three is certainly a statement.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We've seen examples like this before.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You might have thought that a statement has to end in a semicolon,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but if we scroll back to our grammar a bit,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we see, no, a statement can be identifier equals expression,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and those semicolons come in when we have multiple statements,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
like in a compound statement block.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Similarly, x equals 3 divided by 2.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Any expression can go on the right-hand side of the equal sign,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and we saw that our grammar for expression earlier included binary operators like division.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This totally works.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This series of tokens, if x is less than 5 then open curly brace x equals x plus 1 curly brace

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
looks very convincing.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's almost right, but it's missing a semicolon.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Inside these compound blocks we really need those. This one doesn't work.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The one right below it has that semicolon, so it can be derived from "stmt" in our grammar.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Over here inside our compound statement we have two smaller statements--

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
x is x plus 1 and y is 3.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Each one of which is an individual statement,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and each one of which is terminated by a semicolon.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That's the rule we established earlier.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Finally over here we have an if-then-else statement.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This was a little tricky.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In Python conceptually this might work out, but in JavaScript we explicitly need the else token.

00:01:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This one is not derivable from stmt, even though the rest of it is well-formed.
