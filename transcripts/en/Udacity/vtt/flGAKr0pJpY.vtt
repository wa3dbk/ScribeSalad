00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.570
Okay, the next value algorithm we're going to look at

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.930
is what is called the Tournament Barrier. The barrier

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.210
is organized in the form of the tournament with

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.580
N players and since it's a tournament with N players

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.200
and two players playing as, against each other. In

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.900
every match there are going to be log N rounds, log

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.650
N with a base 2. So here is the

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.540
setup for with [INAUDIBLE], they're going to be, they're going to be,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.940
three rounds corresponding to login. And being

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.770
eight we get three rounds. The first round,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.360
second round and the third round. So in

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.430
the first round, they're going to be four matches.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.090
P0 and P1 is one match. P2, P3. P4, P5. P6,

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.270
P7. And the only catch is that we're going to rig this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.540
tournament. In other words what's going to happen is that we're

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.270
going to predetermine who is going to be the winner in

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.560
this round. And, and particularly, we're going to say P0

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.910
is the winner for this match, P2 for this

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.360
one, P4 for this one, and P6 for this one.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.019
So in other words, the matches are rigged. In

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.670
this day and age, when we hear about international scandals

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.180
about match fixing. I guess this is not too

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.600
far fetched. But what is the rational for match fixing?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.220
The key rational is the fact, that if the

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.156
processes are executing on a shared memory machine. Then

00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:26.538
the winner can basically sit on his bumper and

00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:29.208
wait for a process of P1 to come over

00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:34.993
and let him know that he has won the match, P2 can wait until P3 comes over and

00:01:34.993 --> 00:01:37.635
so on and so forth. And what that means

00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:40.627
in a shared memory multiprocessor, is that the spin

00:01:40.627 --> 00:01:42.871
location where P0 is waiting for P1 to

00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:45.387
come and inform him that he's lost the match

00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:49.290
is fixed. The static. And, and so this is

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.790
the idea behind match fixing, that the, the spin

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.920
location for each of these processes, P0, P2,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.260
and P4, and P6, the winners in the first

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.100
round, is predetermined. And that is very, very useful,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.870
especially if you don't have a cache coherent multiprocessor.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.810
If you have NCC [UNKNOWN] machine, In that

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.050
case it is possible to locate the spin location,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.700
in the memory that is very to P0 P2 P4 and P si, P 6 respectively. That's

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.404
the idea behind this this match fixing. So

00:02:21.404 --> 00:02:24.756
the result of matches. Of course P0 will advance

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:27.200
to the next round. P2 will advance to

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.777
the, next round. P4 and P6. And once again,

00:02:30.777 --> 00:02:35.020
in the second drawing we're going to fix the matches. And the winner is going to

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.763
be P0 for round 2. P4 for in this bracket for round 2. And so

00:02:40.763 --> 00:02:45.747
essentially what that means again, is that P0 and P4 can spin on a

00:02:45.747 --> 00:02:51.170
statically determined location. In various processors

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.310
and P2 and P6 respectively will come over and let

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.630
the other guy know that when the match [UNKNOWN] for this

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.680
round. So that is the end of the second round. And, and,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.070
and, of course, if you have you know, with N equal

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.260
to eight, there are only three rounds but, if, for arbitrary N,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.740
we're going to have more levels in the tree and the and

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.340
the, and, and, and [INAUDIBLE] level. We're going to fix the the winners

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.400
and, so it'll propagate up this tree in this fashion, in

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.520
terms of determining statically, who are going to be the winners for

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.140
each round of the tournament. And this will go

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.600
on, all the way up to determining who the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.140
tournament champion is. So in this case, P0 is

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.640
our luck guy, who wins the tournament and so he's

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.000
the champion. And so P0's going to be waiting on

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.390
a statically determined location, where P4 can come and signal

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.250
that P0 has one determinant. So again, the important

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.810
thing that I want you to get out of this

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.720
this particular arrangement that I've mentioned is the fact that the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.630
spin location for each of the processors that are waiting on the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.970
other guy are statically determined. At every level. So this the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.680
first round, the second round, and

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.030
finally the championship, the championship round.
