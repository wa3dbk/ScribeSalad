00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.630
Exponential growth is shown with graph C here. You can see that as x increases,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:14.232
y is also increasing. Exponential decay is shown by graph A. Here, as x

00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:19.944
increases, y decreases. And logarithmic growth is shown by graph B. Our

00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:23.772
function is also increasing everywhere it's domain, but this is not happening

00:00:23.772 --> 00:00:29.251
in an exponential way, as it was over here. Remember also that exponential

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:34.633
functions have horizontal asymptotes, and logarithmic functions have vertical

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:36.133
ones.
