00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.529
It turns out for this graph, it's impossible to tell. We can see that the

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.482
intersection occurs somewhere in this region and it looks like it's about right

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:11.196
here. We're not on a grid line or a certain point, so it's really hard to tell

00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:15.121
or determine just from the graph. So we need some sort of other method to figure

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:15.636
this out.
