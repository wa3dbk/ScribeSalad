00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.090
Now that you've conducted
some user testing,

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.430
you probably have a nice list
of bugs that you need to fix.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.060
So go ahead and squash them.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.290
Then once you've squashed all
those bugs it's a good idea to do

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.940
another round of user testing, and
then you might find some more bugs and

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.260
then you'll squash those, and maybe
you'll have some more users test and

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.980
the cycle will repeat until
your app isn't crashing and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.390
you're ready to either submit
it to the App Store, or,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.030
if you're a nano degree student,
to submit it for grading.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.020
So if you'd like to submit to
the App Store, we have instructions for

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.040
what you need to know,
what you need to prepare, and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.110
what you can expect in
the next few reading notes.
