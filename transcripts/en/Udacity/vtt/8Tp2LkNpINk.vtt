Well, good answers would
be that they may not

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.330
be able to afford their medications so
they don't fill them.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.490
Or they fill them and
try to stretch out the supply.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.610
They may not understand
how to take them properly.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.490
They may not understand
the benefits of taking them.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.370
Or they may not like the side
effects of the medications.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.230
So they don't take them.
