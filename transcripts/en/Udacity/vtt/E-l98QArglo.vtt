This is similar to what Piaget did. He took a toy from a six to seven month old

00:00:04.502 --> 00:00:09.191
infant, and then covered it up with a blanket or towel. And found that infants

00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:12.656
would look at this and be really confused, but then just go on to do something

00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:17.594
else, because they totally that the toy even exists. This is what Piaget called

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:22.024
object permanence. The abilitiy to understand an object is permemant even if

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:27.153
you can't sense it. This is why babies think pee a boo is so much fun. The

00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:31.564
adult keeps appearing and disappearing behind their hands. But notice that

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:35.102
infants grow out of enjoying pee a boo when they develop the cognitive

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:38.740
capability to understand object permanence.
