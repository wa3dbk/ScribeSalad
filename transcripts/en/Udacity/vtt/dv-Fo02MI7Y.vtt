00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Testing just means checking a program to gain confidence that it's correct.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
More formally, in a software engineering class we'd say that we want to gain confidence

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that the implementation adheres to the specification as refined from the requirements.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm not going to spend much time on these words in this class.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You may have a chance to learn about them later.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But the implementation is your source code and the specification and requirements

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
come from the problem statements--whatever you were told to do in the quiz

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or in the homework or by your boss or some such.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is a bit of a personal aside, but in my mind,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
one of the most important things about testing is noticing that it only gains you confidence.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's not a proof.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If you have a big program like a web browser and you try it on 10 web pages

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and it seems good, that is not a proof that it's always going to work perfectly in the future,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but it does give you more confidence than only trying it on 1 web page.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Probably. It depends on how cool that web page is.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So typically, programs are very big and accept an infinite set of inputs.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
There are an infinite number of possible web pages out there.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We know that because the grammar for web pages is recursive

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and allows for infinite creativity.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We could write down any work of literature and have it be a web page.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So we're not going to test them all in finite time;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
we're only going to gain confidence by testing a few.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And because we can't test everything, we have to pick the things to test well.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Just like in the previous quiz, we don't want to waste time on test cases

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that aren't going to get us a debug.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In the real world, in commercial software engineering

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
testing is a huge cost.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In fact, maintenance often accounts for 90% of the life cycle cost of software.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We spend very little time writing a program originally

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and a huge amount of time maintaining it, refactoring it,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
making it better in the face of changing ideas of what the users want,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
all that sort of thing.

00:01:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So testing is massive.
