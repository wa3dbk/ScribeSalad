00:00:00.158 --> 00:00:04.283
Well, server-side rendering is
normally the fastest way to go.

00:00:04.283 --> 00:00:07.616
It introduces a number
of extra challenges for

00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:11.803
a progressive web app that uses
the app shell model because

00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:15.960
the data is already embedded
in the user interface.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.460
If the app caches the data as it was
served, including the embedded data,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.076
it can quickly become stale and
instead of the dreaded flash of

00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:30.800
unstyled content,
you'll have a flash of outdated content.
