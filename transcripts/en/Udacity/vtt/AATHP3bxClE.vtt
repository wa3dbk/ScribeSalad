00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.610
We will not talk about RAID 3
because it's very rarely used today.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.560
So we will go to RAID 4,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.160
which is actually not very often used,
but it helps understand how it works,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.670
to understand how RAID 5,
which is more often used, works.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.110
Raid 4 uses a technique called
block interleaved parity.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.310
It uses N disks and N minus 1, all but
1 of these disks contain data,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.560
which is right across these disks just
like in RAID 0 and then the last disk

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.080
has the parity blocks that protects all
of the blocks of the N minus 1 disks.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.379
So let's look at an example
with four disks.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.580
So we said that three of
the disks contain data, so

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.710
this would be stripe zero.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.840
Then here we have stripe three,
four, and five, and so on.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.700
So we just distribute out
data across all but one disk.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.055
And then we take
the date of stripe zero,

00:00:57.055 --> 00:01:01.410
xor the whole stripe bit
by bit with stripe one.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.730
Xor the whole thing with stripe two and
what we get will be as long as a stripe.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.660
And that gives us the parity stripe for
zero, one,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.600
and two and
we put that on the fourth disc.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.780
Then we go to the next stripe
on each disc, xor them and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.460
that gives us the parity stripe,
for these three stripes and so on.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.880
So the idea here is that if,
let's say one disk fails,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.910
we have the data of the two disks here,
and we have the parity.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.990
We can reconstruct what was on the first
disk by exporting these three.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.460
Or if there is an error in just for
example this one stripe gets too damaged

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.420
to reconstruct by using the error
correction code of this disk

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.890
in that case again, we can read this
stripe, this stripe and the parity.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.930
And then reconstruct what should
have been the bits of this.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.980
So effectively, now we can tolerate
the failure of any one disk.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.080
But the cost is not two times as many
disk as we need to store the data.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.080
Here for example, we are paying only one
quarter of the whole system is spent on

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.980
parity, and three quarters on the data.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.040
Whereas with mirroring,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.840
we would've spent half of the overall
capacity of the system on the mirroring.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.220
You can think of Raid 4 as kind of
a more general technique than mirroring,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.700
because in reality using two discs for
RAID 4,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.520
it's very similar to mirroring because
here we will store the bits of the data,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.820
and here we will store the same bits.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.670
Because a bit, when you don't export
it with anything, you just put it here.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.930
So mirroring is just an extreme
case of RAID 4 when N is just two,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.870
but you want to go to more than two with
RAID 4 because that allows you to have

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.870
lower costs while still being able
to recover from losing one disc.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.920
So now, what does a write do?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.960
It must write one of the data disc and
it must read and write the parity disc.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.290
To update the parity.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.800
Because one of the stripes have changed.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.070
A read, however, only needs to read the
data from the disk where the data is.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.660
We will only reconstruct
the data if that read fails.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.390
But in the normal scenario,
where we get the data we want,

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.780
we don't even have to consult
the parity bit for reads.
