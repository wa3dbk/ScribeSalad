00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:09.070
Earlier, we rewrote Grant's balance after one year as 10,000 times 1 plus 0.03.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.760
Here, we can clearly see those two quantities we were just talking about. The

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:22.494
principle 10,000 right here, and the interest rate, 0.03 right here. So, what

00:00:22.494 --> 00:00:25.718
would happen if we kept our expressions in this form, but found the balance

00:00:25.718 --> 00:00:31.087
after year two? First things first, though, let's remember how we found this

00:00:31.087 --> 00:00:37.763
quantity here. We took the principle, and then, since this is the amount of

00:00:37.763 --> 00:00:41.582
money in the account at the start of this year, we multiplied it by the

00:00:41.582 --> 00:00:48.764
interest rate. That's how we got this quantity. Now, we know that to find this

00:00:48.764 --> 00:00:51.708
balance after two years, we're going to need to start with the amount of money

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:54.652
that's in the account at the beginning of year 2, which is this quantity right

00:00:54.652 --> 00:01:00.729
here. So, this amount is going to sneak around and end up as our starting

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.750
point. Now, I'm about to give you a bunch of boxes to fill in, but please don't

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.755
be overwhelmed. You're very well-prepared to do what I'm about ask you to do.

00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:16.624
It's not a big deal. What I would like you to do is to substitute into these

00:01:16.624 --> 00:01:22.545
green boxes a certain quantity. And I'll give you a hint, the same quantity

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:27.120
belongs in each of these boxes. Think using this equation right here what

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.220
quantity that is. Then, based on what you end up with right here, I'd like you

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.019
to write this in a more compact form right here. However, keep 1 plus 0.03

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:46.023
written as is. Don't change it to 1.03.
