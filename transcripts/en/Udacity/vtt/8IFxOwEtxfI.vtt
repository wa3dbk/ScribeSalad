00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.843
The first cube has a side length of 2, since 2 times 2 times 2 equals 8. The

00:00:04.843 --> 00:00:08.869
second cube has a side length of 5, since these three factors multiply together

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:14.154
to give us 125. And finally, this last one has a side length of 7, since 7

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:16.430
cubed equals 343.
