00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.888
Let's put our new understanding of transforming functions to use, and try to

00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:08.693
graph some interesting equations. If we take the function f of x equals

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:12.937
negative x minus one cubed. We can compare it to the function f of x equals x

00:00:12.937 --> 00:00:16.528
cubed, to help us figure out how this function might look when it's graphed,

00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:22.460
since we already know what this one looks like. So, first things first. What is

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.590
the minus 1 right here doing? Please fill in this sentence properly to tell me

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.799
about this transformation. Which direction does this replacement shift the

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:34.229
graph and by how many units.
