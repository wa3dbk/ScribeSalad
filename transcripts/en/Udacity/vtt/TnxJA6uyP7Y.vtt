00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.280
Now that we know that we need the reorder buffer to hold the results of

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.100
instructions until they're, ready to finish in program order,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.070
let's see what it looks like. The Reorder Buffer is a table of entries.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.090
In each entry we keep at least three fields. One says,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.910
what the value produced by the instruction is. This is the value that we are.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.875
Not writing to the register. When the instruction finishes, it will now write

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:31.480
it's value to the reorder buffer when it broadcasts. We need a bit here to

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.270
tell us whether we actually have a valid value here or not. Because we will give

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.430
a Reorder Buffer entry to the instruction before. It actually writes the result.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.740
And finally in the end we have to write this value to an actual register, and

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.760
for that we need to know when we do such a write, when we move this value from

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.050
the Reordered Buffer to our register, what register are we going to write to? .

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.190
This is a Reordered Buffer that can hold up to eight instructions. And we keep

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.480
instructions in the Reorder Buffer in program order. So we need two pointers,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.070
one pointer tells us when we issue the next instruction where does it go.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.220
Another one tells us when we finally complete in program order the next

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.970
instructions. Which instruction is it going to be? So in this particular

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.320
Reorder Buffer, the instructions that are actually valid are starting

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.420
from the oldest one, to the newest one. This, the even newer instructions,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.980
are going to be added here. And the oldest one will complete from here.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.230
So, these five instructions are actually in program order in the Reorder Buffer.
