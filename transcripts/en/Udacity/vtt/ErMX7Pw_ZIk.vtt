So, I'm going to start by marking the

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.920
relationships that actually hold in the system.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.860
Which are these ones. And then what I'm going to do, I'm going to explain this

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.480
answers. Not here but in the next part of this lesson. By looking at the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.860
different relationships in the context of our

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.240
example. Which will make the explanation much clearer.
