00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.627
When it comes to solving equations, we've learned a lot of different techniques

00:00:03.627 --> 00:00:07.636
to solve the quadratic ones. We saw the square root method, where we could take

00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:11.457
the square root of both sides of the equation. We used plus or minus to

00:00:11.457 --> 00:00:17.064
indicate the positive and negative root for this side. So here, x could equal

00:00:17.064 --> 00:00:21.540
positive or negative 3. We also could set the equation equal to 0 by

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.827
subtracting 9 from both sides. This led us to factor. We could factor x squared

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:35.239
minus 9 as the difference of 2 squares. So we have x minus 3 times x plus 3.

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.705
Setting each factor equal to 0, we would get x could equal positive 3 or

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:44.536
negative 3. So the square root method and factoring were two of the tools in

00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:49.452
our arsenal to solve this type of equation. We could even use the quadratic

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:54.519
formula. If we subtract 9 from both sides. We'll have x squared minus 9 equals

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:02.450
0. This equation has an a value of 1. A b value of 0. And a c value of negative

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.458
9. If we plug in 0 for b in the quadratic formula. And a value of 1 and a c

00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:14.720
value of negative 9. This evaluates to plus or minus 3. Notice that any way we

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.070
solve the original equation, we still get the same answers. Plus or minus 3

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.140
each time.
