00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
There's 2 correct answers here. The first one is very obvious. It's this one here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Because the algorithm, of course, returns the vertex cover and the vertex cover

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
can never get smaller than K. But the really useful answer is this one here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The algorithm has chosen at most 2 K vertices where K would have been the

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
optimum number. Because each time this loop is run, it chooses at least 1 vertex

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
from the optimum solution. What that also means is that it chooses at most 1

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
useless vertex that didn't have to be part of that solution. So the error that it makes

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
is at most 1 extra vertex, but it can make that error at most K times.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And for that reason, the algorithm chooses at most 2K vertices

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
which means that although the Take 2 algorithm doesn't look very smart,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
it's actually a factor 2 approximation algorithm. It guarantees that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the solution that it gives you is at most twice as big as an optimum solution.

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So let's now have a look at the algorithm that seems so sophisticated.
