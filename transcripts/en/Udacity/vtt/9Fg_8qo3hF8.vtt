00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.884
Looking back at our work, we can simplify a complex fraction by following these

00:00:04.884 --> 00:00:10.547
steps. First we want to find the LCD of the internal fractions, each of these.

00:00:10.548 --> 00:00:16.210
Then we multiply our complex fraction by the LCD divided by the LCD. We can do

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.094
this since this is really a form of 1. We'll change what this fraction looks

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:25.840
like, but we won't change its value. Then we'll distribute the LCD to each term,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.910
like we did here, and then we'll simplify to get our final answer. Let's see if

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.333
you can do the next one in a couple of steps.
