Use a variable to store value that you need later. Every variable has a name.

00:00:06.232 --> 00:00:12.327
Here's how I like to think about variables. A parking space is a great example

00:00:12.327 --> 00:00:18.280
of a variable. That's where you can store a value here, the car, so that it's

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:27.440
there when you need it later. This particular variable has the name JO53. We

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.280
want to remember that name. And you need that name if you want to find your car

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.560
later. Now, look at this variable. That's a real Java variable. It also has a

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.750
name. And when you later want to use use the object. That when you use the name

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.649
again. So the name is one of the important aspects of declaring a variable.
