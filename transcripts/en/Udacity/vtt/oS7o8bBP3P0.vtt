00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.175
The vertex of this parabola is at the point 1 comma 2. Great work if you found

00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:10.696
this point. Keep in mind that this parabola is in the form x equals, so we know

00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:16.122
that it's going to open either to the left or to the right. Since the a value

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:21.900
is a positive 1, we know that the graph opens to the right. Now this number is

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.132
important for the vertex its really these 2 numbers. Since this is a horizontal

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:32.290
parabola in the form x equals this number is the x coodinate of our vertex its

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.880
positive 1. To find the y coordinate of our vertex, we simply take our

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.528
binomial, and we set it equal to 0. So we'll have y minus 2 equals 0. Adding

00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:50.660
two to both sides, we get y equals positive 2. This is the y-coordinate of our

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.061
vertex. And notice again how it matches the vertex form for a horizontal

00:00:55.061 --> 00:01:04.239
parabola. This is h and this is k, 1 comma 2. Our vertex.
