00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.830
Okay. So we now come to the part where

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.090
we will create a new project for App Engine. You

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.180
create new projects using the developer console, which can be

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.630
accessed at this URL. This is a console that allows

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.420
you to configure many different Google services. But in

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.450
this course we will focus on the App Engine specific

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.620
parts. Go there and create a new project. We will

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.740
talk about installing the development environment a bit later on,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.950
so don't worry about that right now. While creating

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.630
the project, you will be presented with the following dialog

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.360
box. Pay special attention to the project ID. The project

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.800
ID must be unique and it has certain naming restrictions.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.150
Having a project ID you're happy with, though, can

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.630
be quite handy, since you can access your application through

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.893
a URL containing it. After you've created your project, this

00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:50.696
is the URL that you can use to access it.

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:55.028
So in this example, the final URL will become

00:00:55.028 --> 00:01:01.312
http://apt-octagon-533.appspot.com. See, that's the

00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:06.990
project ID was this. So it's now time for you to go and create your new project.
