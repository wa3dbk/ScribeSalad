00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.930
Okay now we want to connect up our
button the way we did for the label.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.640
First let's make a little room for the
button by moving this label up a bit.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.039
And we'll need to open up our utilities
pane so we can drag in the button.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.990
There we go while we have this
utilities pain on the right open

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.770
let's go ahead and
set the titles on this button and label.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.910
To do that you're going to want to
go to the attributes inspector and

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.460
then you can see here's
where our Title gets set.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.670
We'll just say Click.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.450
And then for the label let's just
set its original text to zero.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.440
Let's close our Utilities pane for
now and move this back to the center.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.730
And next up we're going to set
the target action on this button.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.380
First up, let's open up our
View Controller file for

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.960
a little review on target actions.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.060
Recall that the target action
that we added programmatically

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.760
had three key components.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.890
Its target which was self, the action
which was the method increment count,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.280
and the event that would trigger
that action touch up inside.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.240
So now we're going to use
storyboard to tie together these

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.920
same three pieces of information.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.140
But first, we need to mark this method
as a IB action, so that it actually

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.760
shows up in storyboard, similar to
how we did with the label property.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.690
And we can close our assistant editor
for now and focus on story board.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.430
And then move this over a bit.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.280
And to set our target action,
first we bring up the buttons

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.680
pop up connections menu,
go down to touch up inside,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.010
drag to our View Controller, and choose
the method we want to be our action.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.730
I'm just going to remove that
target action really quick so

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.570
I can show you how to
make it one other way.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.210
Using the canvass view you can still
get to this menu, go from touch up

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.480
inside to the view controller and
then the method increment count and

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.230
you can see the three key
components of the target action.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.650
Let's go ahead and run it so
we can see it in action and

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.479
if we click on the button we
can see our count incrementing.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.240
So that ought to take
care of click counter.
