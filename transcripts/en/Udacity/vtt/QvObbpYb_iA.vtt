00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.574
Let's talk more about the general shape of a logarithmic function. Now, it's a

00:00:04.574 --> 00:00:09.800
bit hard to tell, but none of these graphs here have a horizontal asymptote.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.616
This is similar to how it was hard to tell if that exponential function didn't

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:16.908
have a vertical asymptote. It was just growing so fast and getting steeper and

00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:21.835
steeper. In the same way, since logs are the inverses of exponential functions,

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:27.619
they start to grow more and more slowly as x increases. f of x equals log base

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.162
a of x does however have a vertical asymptote and it's the same for all of

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:35.599
these graphs. What is it?
