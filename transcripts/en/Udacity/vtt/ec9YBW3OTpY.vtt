00:00:00.122 --> 00:00:04.170
So I know there are a lot of steps in
that quiz and it was a lot to process.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.340
So let's start off by looking
at the Android flavor app and

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.350
understanding that code
base first because it has

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.310
all these pieces working
together in a single project.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.700
Remember, you can always download
a simple version of the project, import

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.360
app, and enter studio and it be easier
to navigate through all these files.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.860
So if we scroll down to the bottom,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.630
we see the ReadMe which is
the explanation of what this app is.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.330
So this example uses a list view and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.970
a custom array adapter called
Flavor Adapter to display a custom list

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.780
item view that contains that image and
two text views.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.930
And so all this information is used to
display the Android flavor names and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.300
version names.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.900
So this item layout pattern and

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.360
custom adapter sound very similar
to what we need for the Miwok app.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.910
So as a note, whenever the comments
in the app refer to the adapter view

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.100
it means a view such as the list view or
grid view.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.230
Which are common adapter views.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.780
So here we are again in Android Studio.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.720
So I downloaded a zipped
version of the project and

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.650
opened it here in Android Studio
to explore it some more.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.340
So to see how this project looks,
let's first explore the Java files.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.840
So opening up, we see that there
are three Java files here.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.720
And the first one to take
a look at is the MainActivity.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.043
So given its name, it's probably
the main screen of the app.

00:01:22.043 --> 00:01:27.472
So when we first open the app the main
activity is created by the onCreate

00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:32.736
method and then we set the content
view to be activity_mainlayout.

00:01:32.736 --> 00:01:37.600
So following that, we see there is
an array list call Android flavors that

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.440
contains objects of
the type Android flavor.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.160
So Andrew flavor doesn't
sound like a standard class.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.420
So it's most likely a custom class.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.670
Now to check this out, we'll use
the declaration function in Android.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.750
So to use this, iIll right
click on the name of the class,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.570
go to Go To and then Declaration.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.428
Nice so notice the jumps us
to the Android flavor class.

00:02:02.428 --> 00:02:06.530
So the AndroidFlavor.java is
a custom class that we created.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.356
Notice here that the objects of
this class have three properties,

00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:16.880
version name version number,
and image resource ID.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.845
So values for these are signed in
the constructor which we find down

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:26.250
here and this class also
contains some getter methods.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.750
So what we've done is
we've created an array

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.580
containing these AndroidFlavor objects.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.770
So here we have an example of
a single AndroidFlavor object.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.150
So, with the knowledge of the box and
the states and sign, and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.220
we've taken each of these objects and
put them inside an AndroidFlavors array.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.460
So, many AndroidFlavor objects
are stored in an androidFlavors array.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.900
So, let's go back to the MainActivity.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.360
So, we just saw the array
list getting created up here.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.840
So next are the array adapter calls.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.190
So here's the line where we
instantiate a custom adapter that

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.510
is stored in a variable
called flavorAdapter.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.026
Now to create this AndroidFlavorAdapter,

00:03:10.026 --> 00:03:14.410
we call the constructor and
pass in two inputs.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.500
So this one likely refers to the context
and the second one AndroidFlavors.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.480
It sounds like we're passing in our
AndroidFlavors array so let's see more

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.490
of a host adapters to find by going to
where AndroidFlavorAdapters to find.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.620
So right click, go to Declaration.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.540
So here's
the AndroidFlavorAdapter Java file.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.440
So notice at the top,
AndroidFlavorAdapter extends

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.880
ArrayAdapter, meaning that it
inherits from the ArrayAdapter.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.280
So ArrayAdapter is a superclass and
AndroidFlavorAdapterr is a subclass.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.260
So in addition to just inheriting from
ArrayAdapter, we also customize our

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.960
adapter class to expect the data source
to be a list of AndroidFlavor objects.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.280
So let's take a look at its constructor.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.650
Notice here that we called
the superclasses constructor, so

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.230
we're calling ArrayAdapters
constructor here.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.190
And pass in three inputs.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.704
Now if you remember back to
the discussion about inheritance,

00:04:16.704 --> 00:04:20.480
because AndroidFlavorAdapter
extends ArrayAdapter.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.270
We can use the constructor
from ArrayAdapter so

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.039
that we get all the logic to initialize
the state of the ArrayAdapter for

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.640
free without needing to
write that ourselves.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.710
So this means we can take a look
into ArrayAdapter documentation

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.260
to find out more about its constructor.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.760
So I'm back here in the ArrayAdapter
developer documentation.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.410
I'm going to scroll down to
the public constructor section.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.720
Now out of all of these public
constructors, the second to last one is

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.480
the one that we're using for
our AndroidFlavorAdapter.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.306
So what we call the supercross
class constructor, AKA the array

00:04:56.306 --> 00:05:01.440
adapters contractor,
we need to pass in three inputs.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.920
So the context,
the list item layout resource ID, and

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.760
a list of AndroidFlavor objects.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.130
So I want to copy this code and
paste it over here so

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.930
that we can have it to refer to
when we look back at our code.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.440
Now we're back in Android
studio looking at the code for

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.230
the AndroidFlavorAdapter and
here's the constructor code for

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.600
the array adapter
the superclass in this case.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.110
So notice here that we pass in
zero as the layout resource ID

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.150
because we don't need to rely on the
superclass array adapter inflating or

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.960
creating a list item view for us.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.630
Instead, our Get view method will
mentally handle the inflating of

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.920
the layout from the layout
resource ID ourselves.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.290
So moving down a little bit further,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.190
we'll see more about
what I was talking about.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.310
So, down here, we have the getView
method, and we're overriding the getView

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.360
method from the superclass and adding in
our own logic for a specific use case.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.220
So, the comment above mentions that our
getView provides a list item view for

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.499
an AdapterView of some sorts.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.410
An AdapterView like we mentioned
before could be either a ListView or

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.220
a GridView or
some other type of AdapterView.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.820
So the getView method should
take in three parameters.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.750
So the first is the position
which is the position in the list

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.470
of data this layout should represent,
the convert view

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.620
which is the RecycleView that needs to
be populated and the parent ViewGroup.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.450
So the list items will be added to
this parent ViewGroup as children.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.800
So the first step inside the GetView
method is the getItem method

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.980
which is originally defined in
the superclass ArrayAdapter.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.631
So this method returns the item in
the list at the given index position and

00:06:51.631 --> 00:06:56.130
note that the return value of this
method is an object with the datatype

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.287
AndroidFlavor.

00:06:57.287 --> 00:07:00.779
And this is because in
the class declaration,

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:06.520
we specified an ArrayAdapter will
expect a list of AndroidFlavor objects.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.766
So as a list a few calls
the getView method for

00:07:08.766 --> 00:07:11.210
different positions in the list.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.550
The adapter will go get the items
at the different positions,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.878
in the list of androidFlavor objects.

00:07:16.878 --> 00:07:20.560
So this androidFlavor object contains
the information though populate the list

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.720
item and
will read out that data from it shortly.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:28.140
So the second input parameter of
the getView method is convertView,

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.710
which we said earlier is
an existing view that we can reuse.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.310
However sometimes this view
will be equal to null.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.240
Meaning that there is no
view that we can reuse.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.800
So the view being null is common when
you first open up the activity, and

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.590
you're creating items in the list for
the first time to fill up the screen.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.090
Now once the screen is filled up,

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.510
then it's likely that there will be
a valid view that we can we reuse.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.400
Now in our case,

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.060
because we know that we're working with
list items, I'll assign convertView

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.960
to listItemView to make it clear what
type of view we're working with.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.490
First, we check there's
an existing view that we can reuse

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.310
using this if statement.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.050
If the list item view is dull,

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.800
then we execute this line of code inside
the if statement and this inflates all

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.810
new list item view from the XML
layout file called list item.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.030
And in case you're wondering,
we're using a LayoutInflater which turns

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.190
the XML layout file into
actual view objects.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.270
So we're manually inflating the view
which is why we don't need to pass

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.789
the layout resource ID to
the superclass in the constructor,

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.440
because remember here we passed in zero.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.150
So once we know
the listItemView was valid and

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.840
not null, then we can start
update the text views and

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.480
image views within the list item
based on the AndroidFlavor object.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.380
So notice that we're using the fine
view by ID calls to find the view within

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:56.580
the ID list_item_icon or
list_item_name or list_item_number.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.530
So once we find ImageView and
TextViews, we can call methods like

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:07.112
setImageResource or setText and
pass in the value from the AndroidFlavor

00:09:07.112 --> 00:09:11.984
object to change the data displaying
displayed on these views.

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:15.534
So to summarize,
from the current Android flavor object,

00:09:15.534 --> 00:09:19.368
we can get the different states
from it such as the version name,

00:09:19.368 --> 00:09:22.074
the version number,
and image resource ID.

00:09:22.074 --> 00:09:26.776
So knowing that information from
the specific AndroidFlavor object,

00:09:26.776 --> 00:09:29.828
we can set either the image of or
the text view,

00:09:29.828 --> 00:09:34.720
to be the information that we've
gotten from the AndroidFlavor object.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.190
So at the very end,
we return a list item view.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.250
Which is the list item view
with updated information

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.870
from the current Android flavor object.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.760
So this ListItemView will be added
as a child to the AdapterView.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.520
All right so that's an overview
of how the AndroidFlavorAdapter

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:59.310
is a custom adapter the takes as its
input a list of AndroidFlavor objects.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.900
So, when a list of items uses requested,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:07.450
the AndroidFlavorAdapter will find the
Android view at the correct position and

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.590
then create or reuse a list item layout.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.540
So the views will be updated based on
the information in the AndroidFlavor

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.450
object and then the list item view
is returned to the list view.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:19.460
So back to the main activity.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.899
So the last two lines are related
to implementing the list view and

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:25.370
array adapter.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.110
So one that we've seen before
when modifying them you walk up.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.520
So here we get to
reference the listView and

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.025
we're calling that reference listView.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.163
And then finally we attach
the flavorAdapter to the listView so

00:10:37.163 --> 00:10:38.900
we can populate it with data.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.760
All right so we just unpacked
a rather complex structure.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.840
So let's recap all of it.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.540
So first off we created a way
to store custom objects.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.550
And in this case we use
the androidFlavors array

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.630
which contains AndroidFlavor objects.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:00.740
Next we create a custom adapter that
extends from the ArrayAdapter and

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.000
takes a custom object.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.600
So in this case,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.610
we created AndroidFlavorAdapter
which extends from the ArrayAdapter.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.660
And it took in the custom
object AndroidFlavor.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.650
Also for the last step,
we modified the getView method

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.110
in the custom adapter to provide
a list item view for your ListView.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.790
So we modify the getView method
to get AndroidFlavor objects

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.500
from the ArrayAdapter.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.020
So those at the appropriate position and
then to use that information to populate

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.990
either recycled View or
to populate a newly created View.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.600
So I highly recommend you to walk
through this project on your own and

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.770
see if you can move through how
all these pieces fit together.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.350
So it's well documented.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.520
If you do ever get lost,
refer back to the walkthrough above.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.790
If it helps,
draw out a diagram of the connections.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.870
So understand that the custom
ArrayAdapter pattern is a very powerful

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.170
concept for displaying list in Android.
