00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.650
I'm going to step through this answer and narrate my thoughts. So, you can

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.530
pause my answer at any time and go back and try again if you got stuck

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.820
somewhere. First, I thought about when I want to draw the line. I want to draw

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.570
it when I add a friend. So, I'm going to need to update the addFriend method.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.010
First, I want to draw a circle for the beginning of the line. So, I'll make a

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.865
small circle and draw it at the top left corner of the picture. But in the

00:00:19.865 --> 00:00:25.320
addFriend method, I don't have access to that right now. I lost track of the x

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.520
and y coordinates when the constructor ended. Never saved the top left corner

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.160
before. Maybe this is something the person needs to remember about it, so I'll

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.490
create instance variables for x and y. There they are. But I haven't

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.865
initialized them. Where do I initialize them? I initialize them in the

00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:46.610
constructor, x starts out as x coord and y starts out as y coord. Now I can

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.260
draw my circle. It'll just be a new small circle with x and y, and I'll fill

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.930
it. Now, I want to draw the line. It will start at my upper left coordinate,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.640
but where does it end? It ends at the friend I'm adding. If I want to access

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:08.170
their instance variables, for x and y, I need to use friend.x and friend.y. So,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.483
my line will look like this. Line line is a new line, starts at my , xy

00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:18.720
coordinates and goes to my friend's x, y coordinates. Last, I need to actually

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.930
draw the line. And let's see if I did this right. Looks like it compiled and if

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.800
I run person demo 2, it prints out the picture we wanted. Good work on that

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.840
quiz. That was really good practice. The next time you see something like this,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.580
it'll feel a lot easier than it did this time.
