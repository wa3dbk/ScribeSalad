00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.490
So let's look at these two representations again a little carefully.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.440
Now, typically to do any kinds of processing we would actually require us to

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.030
be able to create a discrete representation of a matrix like this.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.440
So something like this can be converted into a matrix, as I've shown before.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.320
Of course I'm just showing you a six by six part of this.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.660
But basically this entire thing would be represented as a matrix.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.870
And what we would be doing is,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.630
basically we're trying to sample the two dimensional space into a regular grid.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.030
In this, the regular grid are basically columns and rows.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.500
And that allows us to be able to now look for

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.580
values that we can actually start looking at as we traverse through.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.870
So I can start counting down in raster scan format,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.530
going down the axes this way, and wrapping around.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.960
And basically, in essence, what it means is now we have a matrix,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.030
just like I showed before, of integer values ranging from 0 to 255.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.600
Now my goal is to give you a bit of an intuition of what this image looks like.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.800
And what are the kinds of things within it.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.910
Again, let's take of this black and white or grayscale image.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.730
And I'm going to now both again zoom into right box here, but

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.800
also kind of show you this image in few different ways.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.100
So the first video I'm going to show here is basically the height map

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.770
of this image.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.340
If you look at it as it's being rotated around,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.610
you can actually see the pixel values that I was referring to earlier.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.410
And these peaks and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.540
valleys kind of show again that the intensity values of the image

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.680
have various types of statistics associated with it, and by playing around with

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.650
those statistics we can actually do a lot of interesting things to images.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.640
Now I'm going to show the same thing, for this sub-image, again zooming in.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.574
Now here again you notice the, gray and

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.660
the white regions which we have seen before.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.810
And now in this video which you see basically,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.550
as I rotate around that basically see some of the details.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.040
And also the, the ridge, that shows up between the, the hill and

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.190
as we go towards the value which is again the lower values of gray here.
