00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.850
Before you continue to the next lesson, I'd like to encourage you to

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.250
take a minute to set up a Git workspace that will work well for you.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.660
If you take the time to configure a few things about Git,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.540
it can be much easier and more pleasant to use.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.630
My configuration includes this custom prompt,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.060
which shows my user name in purple and what directory I'm in in blue.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.090
Having it more colorful like this just makes it stand out more from

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.650
the other commands.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.150
Now, if I cd into a directory with a Git repository, I also have this in green,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.250
which shows which commit I currently have checked out.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.160
Right now, it's just showing the commit ID, but in lesson two,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.110
you'll see how to give commits names and this will become more useful.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.010
This prompt will also show a star if I've made any changes since committing.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.220
So if I were to open up game.js and add another line, then you see a star here,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.390
which indicates that I have changes that haven't been committed.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.430
I'm just going to undo that, so now the star is gone.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.287
I also have tab completion set up so

00:00:57.287 --> 00:01:01.386
I can type just the first few characters of a Git command, for example, git l

00:01:01.386 --> 00:01:05.572
and press Tab, and the rest of the command will be completed automatically.

00:01:05.572 --> 00:01:08.950
There are also some situations where Git will open up a text editor.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.440
For example, as you'll see in the next lesson, when you make a submit,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.398
Git opens an editor for you to write a commit message.

00:01:15.398 --> 00:01:18.280
You want to just set this editor to whatever you prefer to use.
