00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
Let's build off this a little bit.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:08.890
Let's do that by taking all of these vertices that have k+1 edges or more and actually putting them

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.430
in the cover and that's because we already said it has to be in the cover.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.610
Now, what we can do is actually remove these vertices from the graph and any edges

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.420
connected to them because those edges are automatically covered

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.450
so we don't have to worry about them anymore.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.250
We automatically are dealing with a much smaller graph or potentially much smaller graph.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.530
What this tells us is that after removing these vertices, each remaining vertex can cover

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.780
at most a certain number of edges if it's put in a cover, and this could either be--

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.320
k-1, k, k+1, 2k, or k² edges.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.150
What this would then mean is that the remaining graph can't have no more than a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.520
certain number of edges if G is a "Yes" instance of the vertex cover decision problem,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:08.010
which is the original assumption that we made, and this can either be k-1, k, k+1, 2k, or k².

00:01:08.010 --> 99:59:59.000
So please check whichever is appropriate for both of these questions.
