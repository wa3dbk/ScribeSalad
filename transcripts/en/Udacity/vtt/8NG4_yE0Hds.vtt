00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.440
What we're going to do is,
we're going to talk about segmentation.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.510
I want to motivate this using a toy
problem, a very simple problem, and

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.700
then we'll move to slightly
more sophisticated examples.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.030
So here's our toy example problem.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.010
So we have an image on the left, and
you can see that there not that many

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.330
gray levels present and in fact there's
a histogram of them on the right.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.640
And on the histogram, you can see that
there's this big collection of black

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.650
pixels, another collection of gray
pixels, even a little bit bigger and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.840
what's this thing on the right?

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.250
That's this huge collection
of white pixels.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.970
And they're exact.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.820
They're black, gray and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.400
white which leads to thinking that okay
in this image there are three regions.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.405
And I would label them 1 for the black.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:42.170
2 for the gray and 3 for the white.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.930
So the idea is that we went from
the groups in this histogram

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.940
to these segments in the picture.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.180
But of course that's on
this trivial picture.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.910
Here we have that, that clean image.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.720
What if you have a noisier image, right?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.900
So here I've just added
a little bit of noise.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.620
And now our histogram is not just
these straight lines anymore.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.940
But we get these
distributions of intensity.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.550
So the question of how
do we break things up.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.140
And the question is you know,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.570
how do we carve this histogram
into these different groups?

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.730
In particular,
we refer to this as clustering.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.680
So there's a fundamental relationship
between segmentation which is carving

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.150
an image up and this notion of
clustering which pixels belong together.
