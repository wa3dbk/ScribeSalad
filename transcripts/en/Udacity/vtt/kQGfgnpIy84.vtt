00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.974
We learn the words monomial, binomial, and trinomial. So that way, we could talk

00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:07.707
about polynomials. I'll be saying those words a lot. So I wanted to make sure

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:11.122
you're clear on them. For example, here we have a trinomial and another

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:14.936
trinomial. And we're going to try and add these together. Before we get started,

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:19.006
I'm going to show you some algebra tiles to help us think through this. Here's a

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:24.231
square, and each side of this square is x units in length. I don't know it. But

00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:29.498
I do know that the area of the square is x times x, or x squared. This rectangle

00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:34.107
has a legnth of one on one side, and x on the other. So the area of this

00:00:34.107 --> 00:00:39.806
rectangle would just be x. And finally, this last tiny square, has an area of 1,

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:45.401
it's a 1 by 1 square. I drew these shapes out to help us think about like terms.

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:50.850
So let me show you what this problem would like, using these shapes. For this

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.341
first trinomial, I would have three x squared's, four x's, and 3, or three 1's.

00:00:56.341 --> 00:01:01.599
You can see a similar representation for the second trinomial. So if you want to

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:06.762
add these two polynomials together, we want to combine the like terms. To add

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:11.917
like terms together, we simply add up the coefficients of the same term. So 3x

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:17.824
squared and 2x squared would make 5x squared. 4 x and 2 x would make 6 x's, and

00:01:17.824 --> 00:01:24.960
3 and 1 would make 4. I can rearrange my terms in the first polynomial and the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.189
second polynomial to get my like terms. Now that we have this, we're ready to

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.120
combine like terms. Here was the original problem, and if we're just adding we

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.272
can drop the parentheses and rearrange to find our like terms. So we have 5x

00:01:43.272 --> 00:01:48.046
squared plus 6x plus 4. This is the trinomial we get when we add these two

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:48.771
together.
