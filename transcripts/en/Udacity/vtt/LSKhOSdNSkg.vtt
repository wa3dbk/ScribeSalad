00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.910
Let's motivate the graph partitioning
problem through a different problem.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.050
Suppose I want to multiply a sparse
matrix A times a vector X.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.320
Remember the duality between
matrices and graphs.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.200
Meaning this sparse matrix has this
equivalent graph representation.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.680
The rows and corresponding columns
of the matrix are vertices and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.570
the non-zeros are edges.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.890
One way to do a distributed breadth
first search is to use a computational

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.350
primitive that looks like this
linear algebra operation.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.581
Now, suppose you decide to distribute
the work by first dividing the matrix

00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:33.340
row-wise.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.680
You would then assign
block rows to processes.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.780
Note that this assignment corresponds
to a partitioning of the graph.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.710
This example is a vertex based or
just vertex partition.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.450
Observe that this partitioning
usually also implies

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.580
a partitioning of the vectors x and y.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.910
That's because there's a one to one
mapping of vector entries to graph

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.140
vertices.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.580
Now the amount of work in a sparse
matrix vector multiply is proportional

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.814
to the number of non-zeroes.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.430
So, when you divide up the rows,
you might want to do so

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.810
in a way that balances the number
matrix non-zeroes per partition.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.330
So that's one goal.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.960
Now, you have another goal
in choosing a partition.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.160
Hm, what is that goal?

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.240
Recall that the vertex x is partitioned.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.430
Now suppose you want to
update the first block of Y.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.629
Because of these non-zeros you're
going to need these corresponding

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:25.190
elements of x.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.820
That requires communication with the
processes that own these elements of x.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.100
In the language of graphs,
these communication exchanges happen

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.020
anytime an edge crosses
a process boundary.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.810
For instance, these two non zeros,
correspond to this edge.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.940
The two processes that own the endpoints
of the edge, will need to communicate.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.600
This observation suggests a second goal.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.300
To minimize communication volume,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.310
you prefer to reduce
the number of edge cuts.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.380
This example motivates the classic
graph partitioning problem.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.840
You're given a graph and
a target number of partitions as input.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.600
Your goal is to divide the vertices
into, say, P partitions.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.920
You'd like this partitioning to
have the following properties.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.820
First, these partitions should cover all
the vertices but should be disjoint.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.960
The partition should also
be about equal in size.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.230
And the number of cut
edges should be minimized.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.430
That is the graph partitioning
problem in a nutshell.
