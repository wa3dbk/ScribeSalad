00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.780
Having defined the variables,

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.000
we're now ready to move on to
building the boolean formula.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.830
We're going to start with
the clauses needed so

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.210
that given a satisfying assignment,
it's clear how to fill out the table.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:11.730
Nevermind for

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.730
now about whether the corresponding
sequence has valid transitions.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.900
For now, we just want the individual
configurations to be well-defined.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.500
First, we have to enforce that at each
step, the machine is in some state.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.440
Hence, for all steps i,
at least one of the state variables for

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.910
that step has to be true.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.360
Note that r denotes
the number of states here.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.320
In this context, it's just a constant.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.930
The input to our reduction is just
the string that we need to transform

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.880
into a boolean formula.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.180
The machine also can't be
in two states at once.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.450
So we need to enforce that constraint
as well by saying that for every pair

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.240
of state variables for a given turn
step, one of the two has to be false.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.750
Together, these sets of clauses
enforce that the machine corresponding

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.720
to a satisfying tooth assignment.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.410
Is in exactly one state after each step.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.129
For the position of the head,
we have a similar set of clauses.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.140
The head has to be over some
square on the tape, but

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.360
it can't be in two places at once.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.480
And lastly, each square on the tape
has to have exactly one symbol.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.490
Thus, for all steps I and squares J,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.780
there has to be some symbol on
the square, but there can't be two.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.430
The other clauses related to individual
configurations come from the start and

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.480
end states.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.240
The machine must be in the initial
configuration at step zero.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.852
This means that the initial state must
be q0, that the head be over the first

00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:41.486
position on the tape, and that the first
part of the tape contained input w.

00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:44.750
The rest of the tape must
be set to blank to start.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.930
And finally, the computation
must end in an accepting state.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.420
This we can enforce
with the single clause

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.660
that the state after step
p(n) be the accepting state.
