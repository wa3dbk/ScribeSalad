00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.520
So far in this final exam we've written a lexer, a

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.500
parser and now in this problem we're going to write an

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.330
interpreter. However, we're mixing it up a bit and we're not

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.410
going to write an interpreter for a programming language per se,

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.630
but rather for a market. We're going to be given a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.230
list of how much money people have, things that they want

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.660
to buy, and things they're willing to sell. And we're going

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.560
to simulate the market and the result is going to be

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.790
the amount of money that people have left over. So

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.580
let's take a look at an example input into our interpreter.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.830
So here I have our abstract syntax tree for our

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.610
market. At the beginning we declare how much money Klaus and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.170
Andreas, are two participants in the marketplace, have. And then

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.630
we talk about what are they willing to buy and sell.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.300
Within each element, we generally say, who is the person

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.660
that this element applies to. The what, this element is dealing

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.570
with, and then some amount of money. So for the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.530
has elements, we're saying Klaus has 100 coins. And we're saying

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.386
Andreas has 50 coins. Down here we're saying Klaus wants

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:04.690
to buy a sheep for 50. He also wants to buy

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.470
another sheep for 50, you can have more than 1. Andreas

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.360
wants to sell a sheep for 50, and he wants to sell

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.310
another sheep for 50. So Klaus wants to buy two sheep, each

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.670
for 50. Andreas wants to sell two sheep, each for 50. We

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.470
should probably be able to make a deal here. Note that

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.010
after the has elements, the buys and sells can be in any

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.610
order. So let's step through this by hand and see if we

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.460
can come up with an algorithm for which to write our interpreter.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.010
So here we're saying Klaus has 100 coins. We should probably

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.960
keep track of that since the output of the entire interpretation

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.460
is going to be a list, of how much money each

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.440
person has. Or actually, we're going to store it as a dictionary, but,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.700
so let's do that. I just wrote Klaus for short. So,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.250
we say Klaus has 100, okay. We are done with this,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.480
we don't need it anymore. This next line says Andreas has

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.380
50, so let's update our dictionary. All right, we're done with this.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.500
Now that we see Klaus wants to buy a sheep for 50.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.320
Let's see if anyone is willing to sell a sheep. So, let's

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.160
go through the rest of them one by one. So we, in

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.350
this next line it's about Klaus buying. We don't really care about

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.150
buying, we're looking for selling. Okay, here we have a sell, it

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.800
happens to be for a sheep, and it also happens to be

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.490
for the exact amount that we want. So, these three elements match

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.380
perfectly for what we're looking for. One more thing that we have

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.580
to check is to make sure that Klaus has at least

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.690
50 coins to make the transaction. So, we look up here,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.010
Klaus has 100, that's more than 50, he's able to afford

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.890
it. So, now we do the transaction, Klaus now only has

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.960
50 and Andreas now has 100. We should cross off the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.870
elements that we used. Now let's continue the process from the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.470
top again. So, we only have two things left. So, the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.540
next one is Klaus wants to buy a sheep for 50.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.990
We do the same look up, go to the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.150
next element, see sell sheep 50. Yay. Klaus has

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.630
at least 50, we're all good. Let's make the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.814
transaction. Okay. We've gone through everything in our parse

00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:07.020
tree. There's nothing left to do because there's nothing

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.780
left. So, our output is just going to be

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.700
this dictionary. So, we went through that algorithm, it's

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.760
pretty straightforward, it's a matter of just stepping through what

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.970
is available, and doing what we can until there's

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.105
nothing left. So, now you're probably thinking, where's the code?

00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:24.190
Well, let me show you. So here I have the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.830
solution. It may look a bit messy, but it's actually

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.200
pretty straightforward. The first thing we do, is declare the

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.180
dictionary that we store how much money that each person

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.010
has. And the basic strategy like I went over is

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.460
to continue going through elements in the parse tree until

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.690
there's nothing left to do, until we didn't do anything and

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.330
so nothing's changed and we should just stop. In the case

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.570
of the example that I went over, that just meant that

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.380
we were out of elements, but it could also be the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.090
case that no one can afford to buy anything, so we

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.570
should just stop. So let's assume that there's nothing left to

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.700
do, and then only change it once we do something. We're

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.870
going to go through each element in our abstract syntax tree.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.270
We're going to pull out who is involved in

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.300
the element. That's always the zero index, the first element

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.230
in the tuple. We're going to do what kind of type it is, okay. If it's a has. So

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.290
those are going to go first. We're going to

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.510
put that person in our environment. And then what I'm

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.650
doing right here, is we're just marking off it

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.090
as skip. We're changing the type to skip. Skip isn't

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.350
has, buy or sell, so we're just going to ignore

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.290
it. This is equivalent to me crossing it off. An alternative

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.440
way of doing a similar process would be, to recursing onto

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.360
the parse tree and removing parse tree elements, as we use

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.480
them. But this is, just as easy. If we're in

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.740
a buy scenario, if we find an element for which we

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.520
want to buy, we're going to take out what we want

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.160
to buy and how much it's for. And then we're going to

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.430
go through the abstract syntax tree again. If

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.110
we find an element in the abstract syntax tree

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.990
that is a sell, it's what we're looking for.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.430
I can afford it for that price, and it's

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.860
the price that I want to pay for

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.460
it. We're going to do the transaction. This involves skipping,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.680
crossing off. Both elements in the parse tree that

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.460
are involved in the transaction. Subtracting off the new

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.410
cost, and adding that amount of money to the person that sold

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.340
it. And we're also here putting finished equals false, because we did

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.280
something. The state has changed and we should do another pass. And

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.950
once we're done, we just return the dictionary that we started with.
