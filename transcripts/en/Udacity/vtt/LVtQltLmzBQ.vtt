00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.960
When you change the DIV tag to an H1 tag, the text should have changed in size,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.000
and also the box around the text should have changed.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.050
Looking at this in the browser, when we change this DIV tag to H1,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.410
save the file, and refresh our browser, we see that the text got bigger,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.750
and we also have extra space above and below the text.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.690
We can verify this in Developer tools by mousing over H1,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.280
and you'll see that we have a rectangle around the My App title.
