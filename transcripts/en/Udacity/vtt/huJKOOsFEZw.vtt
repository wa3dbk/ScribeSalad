00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.622
For this lesson, we're going to try our hand at adding rational expressions.

00:00:03.623 --> 00:00:06.660
We're going to draw upon our knowledge of adding fractions to figure that out.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.952
For example, if we wanted to add 3 11ths to 2 11ths, we would just add the

00:00:10.952 --> 00:00:15.958
numerators and keep the denominators the same. We would get a total of 5 11ths.

00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:20.849
Keep in mind we can only add or subtract two fractions whenever the denominators

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.900
are like. Keeping this in mind, I want you to try and add these rational

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.340
expressions together. This last one isn't addition though, it's subtraction. So

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.970
you want to make sure you subtract the numerator. You'll also need to use your

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.127
knowledge of simplifying rational expressions for these two problems. Try your

00:00:37.127 --> 00:00:40.143
best, and don't worry if they're not right on the first try.
