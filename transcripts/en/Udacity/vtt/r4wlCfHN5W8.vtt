00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.820
Now that you're experts on properties,
let's go back to methods for a moment

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.620
and think a little more carefully about
the syntax of how methods are called.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.170
I've initialized the movies here, so

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.900
we can have a movie archive object
devoted to Rob Reiner movies.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.520
You've already seen
a call to filterByYear.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.200
Here it is one more time.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.580
We just use .syntax on an instance
of the MovieArchive class, and

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.540
then we call filterByYear and
pass in the year we want to filter by.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.371
Let's go with 1986.

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:30.352
And then, we'll want to grab
the first item from our movies array,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.545
Print out the title and
we can see that it's Stand By Me.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:39.690
filterByYear is an instance method.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.410
You may also have occasion to call
type methods or class methods.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.380
Type methods, like type properties,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.080
belong to the class, not to any
particular instance of the class.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.870
And so, they're called on the class
instead of being called on

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.270
an instance of the class.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.750
You're going to run into a number of
type methods when you start working with

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.475
the iOs user interface library.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.390
UIKit.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.430
For example,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.970
here's a class method that you'll use
when you build the second portfolio app.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.970
Me me.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.150
This method belongs to
the UIImagePickerController class.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.400
It's called is SourceTypeAvailable.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.180
It takes in a source type as an argument
and returns a bool indicating whether

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.850
that source type is available
on the current device.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.470
A source type, in this case, is
the source of an image, like a camera or

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.720
a photo album.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.000
In the playground,
there's no camera available.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.340
So in the playground environment,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.270
if you pass in source type camera,
this method returns false.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.030
The playground does have access
to the photo library, so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.200
if you pass in source type photo
library, the method returns true.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.620
If you are running this code
on a phone with a camera,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.160
this method would return true for
both source types.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.050
Let's take a look at the class
definition for UIImagePickerController.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.630
I can access it from the playground by
command clicking on the class name.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.990
Now, this might look intimidating.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.000
But all it is a list of properties and
methods.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.605
Right here is the method
isSourceTypeAvailable.

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:00.805
Notice that it has the word
class before func.

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:02.327
Just like type properties.

00:02:02.327 --> 00:02:06.005
Type method definitions begin
with the word class or static.

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:08.955
Otherwise, they're defined
just like instance methods.

00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:11.585
And if you use the word
class instead of static,

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:13.715
subclasses will be able
to override the method.
