00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.440
So now that we have seen what storage devices

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.210
look like, let's talk about how they and other I/O

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.945
devices can be connected to the system. We usually connect

00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:12.900
I/O devices using some sort of a standardized I/O bus.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.564
It needs to have a standard because we want to

00:00:15.564 --> 00:00:18.732
be able to connect for example, hard drives from one

00:00:18.732 --> 00:00:22.252
manufacturer to a computer built by another one. And then

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:25.241
possibly even replace the hard drive with another one from

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.295
another manufacturer. Or even move our existing hard

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.267
drive from one system to a new one we

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:34.551
are buying so that we can access our data without having to spend a lot of time

00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:39.868
copying it. Because these buses have standards they have a limited

00:00:39.868 --> 00:00:44.905
rate of improvement, and often this improvement goes in steps. So

00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:49.900
all of the technology might go up in a relatively smooth fashion.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.750
This is where a new standard gets adopted

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.170
by manufacturers so things suddenly improve. But then for

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.051
a while you just have the same buses even

00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:07.371
though the technology is actually improving. And instead of

00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.261
having just one type of bus that connects

00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:13.916
to all I/O devices, typically we have a hierarchy

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:17.790
of buses. You have a mezzanine bus such as

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.442
PCI Express. It will be pretty fast and short

00:01:21.442 --> 00:01:26.198
so that it can be this fast, and it can be used to directly connect fast

00:01:26.198 --> 00:01:31.320
devices to the processor such as for example graphics. Then we will

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.350
connect storages buses to it. For example, the SATA or

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.730
SCSI for hard drives, both of these are used usually to connect storages

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.454
devices. These are somewhat specialized for storage.

00:01:47.454 --> 00:01:55.830
And a SATA controller will act as a PCI Express device on the mezzanine bus.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.440
But the controller itself actually controls a SATA bus to which we

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.918
now connect devices. So the reason why we have these and don't directly

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:12.798
connect our hard drives to the PCI Express, is that although these, for example,

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:15.822
serial ATA buses are slower, there is also

00:02:15.822 --> 00:02:19.305
less change in their standards. And there need

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.725
not be that much change because these devices

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:26.055
are much slower than what the PCI Express can

00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:28.890
provide. So, we don't really need all the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.931
speed of PCI Express. In exchange, we get

00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:34.504
to keep our hard drive standards for a

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:38.073
while longer while PCI Express can improve a little

00:02:38.073 --> 00:02:43.818
bit more rapidly. All we have to do is devise new controllers that connect

00:02:43.818 --> 00:02:49.773
these storage busses to the newest PCI Express that we have. And then we can

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:56.134
have a USB hub for example, also attached to a PCI Express bus. The USB hub

00:02:56.134 --> 00:03:03.414
itself provides a USB bus connection for USB devices that are even slower than

00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:09.715
for example, SATA. But again, their standard lives for a lot longer, so we can

00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:15.443
use a lot of different devices relatively cheaply and connect them to this. So

00:03:15.443 --> 00:03:22.163
overall we can have is a PCI Express bus to which we can attach the processor,

00:03:22.163 --> 00:03:28.480
the graphics, the I/O bus control for disks, for USB. And these in turn

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.330
provide buses to which we can attach disks

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.370
here, and also some devices here. So the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.682
closer we get to the processor, the more

00:03:37.682 --> 00:03:41.218
important it is to keep improving speeds, because, because

00:03:41.218 --> 00:03:43.938
some of the devices, like graphics, need that

00:03:43.938 --> 00:03:46.722
speed. But for storage, and for many of the

00:03:46.722 --> 00:03:49.608
standard USB devices, we really are much more

00:03:49.608 --> 00:03:53.567
interested in standardization so that we can exchange these.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.583
So that we can interchange these devices and not have them tied

00:03:56.583 --> 00:04:00.050
to a particular technology and have to change them every year or two.
