00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
By the way just as on the side, I've been talking about problem or need as part of the product.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And I just want you to remember it's kind of interesting to differentiate between

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
solving a problem or if somebody who has an accounting problem or a word processor

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or they can now use Google docs versus Microsoft Word versus a need.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What's a need? Well, a need might be a need to be entertained or a need to communicate.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Needs are something that are universal across all 7 billion people on the planet.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Your total available market plus or minus a couple of billion.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Maybe kids 0-5 don't have those needs but eventually you will find market sizes

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
for needs to be multiples by orders of magnitude above solving problems.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And so, I'm not suggesting that you don't solve problems.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm not suggesting that you try to turn every problem into a need.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But let me suggest the one company in the 21st century that did this better

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
than anybody else in the planet was Apple and the iPhone.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
They took a communications device and made it a status symbol, and they transitioned

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
from a product that solved a problem, integrated web browser, e-mail, and phone

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
into something that people now every year obsolete their own products by wanting to get

00:01:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the next one because it's now a need rather than a product.
