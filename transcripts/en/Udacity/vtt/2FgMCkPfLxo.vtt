00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.190
Thanks very much for coming in and
sitting down with me, Parema.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.670
We're building a new app here for
our company.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.100
We're looking specifically at the to-do
and calendar management space.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.350
And so based on the flow that I've
laid out here, I'd like to talk

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.540
to you about a couple of different
things that we're seeing with it.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.860
So obviously over here,
we have a very clear screen for

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.810
creating and editing new events.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.390
But I'm kind of curious
to understand initially,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.820
coming from the home screen or the data
glance screen, do you see an easy and

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.500
clear way to create new entries?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.117
&gt;&gt; Yeah, is that using
the floating action buttons?

00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:34.460
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.630
So the floating action button is
a pattern that we've established across

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.160
our application here.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.576
So we have fabs in a couple
of different places.

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:46.000
Fab placement has been a thing
that we've dealt with in the past,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.620
so I'm kind of curious to understand.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.760
On these two screens, we have fabs up
near the hero section of the page.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.280
But over here, we've got our
fab at the bottom of the page.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.340
Does the location of the fab changing,
does that cause any issues for

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.379
you or are you comfortable with that?

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.205
&gt;&gt; I personally like it with
the hero by the hero banner.

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:15.146
I don't know why, because I'm able
to see all the events down below, so

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:19.682
and then looking over that, and
then I have to go over and search for

00:01:19.682 --> 00:01:21.722
the floating action button.

00:01:21.722 --> 00:01:23.476
So, which is why I feel,

00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:27.747
it's actually kind of nice when
it's with the hero banner.

00:01:27.747 --> 00:01:28.443
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:32.381
You know even with such a strong
affordance associated with the hero

00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:36.160
banner, we can still get at it
here on this screen, as well.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.280
But there is no hero
element to associate with.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.220
And so we still end up
having to roll with it at

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.910
the bottom of the screen here.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.940
One of the things too is that,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.660
one of our concerns is that with a fab
of this size, right, that potentially

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.160
it could obscure some of the information
that we're looking at here.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.300
Now in this case,
if we're just looking at that,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.990
it's just avatars of the people, but
as you're showing through the list,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.370
there could be more valuable
bits of information.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.010
Do you feel that that would be a real
strong problem for our users, or

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.500
they would be able to work
around that with scrolling?

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.467
&gt;&gt; I think they would be
able to work around that,

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:13.664
although it does look a little
like blocking some of the content.

00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:14.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.910
&gt;&gt; That might happen, but I think once
you get a hang of it and once you're

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.530
comfortable with the app, I think
eventually users will get a hang of it.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.680
&gt;&gt; Okay, interesting, so
I have one big question.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.830
Given that this is sort of a to-do
in an event management system,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.980
do you see a clear way to actually say,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.160
I'm done with this particular event?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.791
&gt;&gt; Do you mean to say by just crossing
it off, clearing it from the list?

00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:45.680
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; And just marking.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.240
So I think it's these check buttons.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.875
&gt;&gt; Very cool, okay so you picked
up that affordance quite quickly,

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:55.090
whereas other participants we've
had come through our study

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.670
have maybe struggled with
that just a little bit

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.410
Why do you feel that that affordance
jumped out for you so quickly?

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.550
You picked up on it really.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.935
&gt;&gt; I think it's sort of like
the distinguishing factor between,

00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:10.522
one of them was checked, and
the other was not checked.

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:11.149
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:15.830
&gt;&gt; So, I figured okay, this event
is probably over, or it's done.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.040
So you move on and
check the rest of them.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting
though that in this case,

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.800
the affordance is just a gray dot.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.300
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.080
&gt;&gt; So if you were to see three gray
dots here and perhaps not the checkbox,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.080
do you think that that would
stand out as much for you?

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.988
&gt;&gt; I think that would be
a little confusing to-

00:03:33.988 --> 00:03:34.590
&gt;&gt; Little confusing?

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what does this button do?

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.354
Maybe I would be curious to try
it out and see what happens then.

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:42.042
&gt;&gt; Interesting, okay.

00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:44.909
So you're willing to be a little
bit forgiving with the application,

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.767
try some things to learn
what the pattern is.

00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:47.347
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:47.347 --> 00:03:49.020
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.550
One other big question that's
come up in previous feedback,

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.270
is that we can only manage those
events from this particular screen.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.060
Do you feel strongly that we
would want to able to manage them

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.950
from something like the home screen?

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.980
The home screen is much more of
an at a glance screen, and so

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.520
we did not strongly associate
event management there.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.950
Do you still feel that that's valuable,
do we need to go that direction?

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it definitely
will be convenient,

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.040
since it's listing out the details of
the event, to be able to check it off.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.330
Or are you talking with respect
to details that particularly need

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.880
to be in the home screen, or just about
having to manipulate, edit events?

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.636
&gt;&gt; It's really solely just about
manipulating or editing the events.

00:04:35.636 --> 00:04:40.505
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we could add something
like just swiping the event and

00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:44.693
giving the user more options
on what they can actually do,

00:04:44.693 --> 00:04:49.916
like what editing options they actually
get while doing that function.

00:04:49.916 --> 00:04:51.523
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:53.470
So if we were to add
some sort of swiper or

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.184
some other gesture of support
to one of these screens,

00:04:56.184 --> 00:04:59.140
what would your expectation be
that that gesture would do?

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.510
If we were to, for instance,
swipe across one of these things?

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.770
&gt;&gt; From most of the apps that I've used,
probably have a delete.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.575
As well as maybe a more that
would take you to a list

00:05:13.575 --> 00:05:18.161
of functionality, like you know.

00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:21.500
&gt;&gt; Would you want to reveal like
a hidden panel behind that thing?

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.160
Or go with something that's
a little more like Google's inbox,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.760
where it's just task completion?

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.550
&gt;&gt; I think I would want more of a panel.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.085
&gt;&gt; I see, okay.

00:05:32.085 --> 00:05:33.663
&gt;&gt; That gives options, more options.

00:05:33.663 --> 00:05:34.545
&gt;&gt; You'd would want to see more options?

00:05:34.545 --> 00:05:35.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.904
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:05:35.904 --> 00:05:41.334
If we did support something like just
a gesture to mark a task complete,

00:05:41.334 --> 00:05:43.390
not a revealed panel.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.800
Would you want that particular
entry to disappear,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.970
would you want it to
remain on the screen?

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.360
What would be a clear indication,,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.770
aside from just the blue
checkbox that this event is done?

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.753
&gt;&gt; I think that any event that's
done does not need to appear on

00:06:02.753 --> 00:06:07.438
the home screen, so
I'm just thinking why it would have

00:06:07.438 --> 00:06:11.541
to be on their home screen
once the event is over.

00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:15.092
So I would only have checking it off,

00:06:15.092 --> 00:06:20.220
would mean it's going to
disappear from the list.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.800
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.480
Would you have that expectation
of the daily at a glance screen?

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.480
Would you want to see things
that have been completed there?

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.050
&gt;&gt; Because it sounds to me like in
your heads up in our landing page,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.940
you don't want to see that.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.171
But you do want to see it here?

00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:38.707
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the daily calendar,
daily event list,

00:06:38.707 --> 00:06:43.495
I would want to see all the events
that have been completed.

00:06:43.495 --> 00:06:45.735
And events that are coming up.

00:06:45.735 --> 00:06:50.649
&gt;&gt; Yeah,, I think in previous feedback
we got an indicator that we would want

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:53.464
to see that stuff in
case we made a mistake.

00:06:53.464 --> 00:06:57.730
We accidentally swiped something
that we didn't intend to.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.810
Okay, one last question for you, and
then I'll let you get back to your work.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.230
So the one thing that we haven't talked
a whole lot about is how we delete

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.920
events, right?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.160
It's one thing to say an event is done,
but I've just made a mistake and

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.085
I've created one.

00:07:11.085 --> 00:07:16.070
Where would you expect to see
delete come out in this UI?

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.452
&gt;&gt; So I think delete would
be when you swipe the event.

00:07:20.452 --> 00:07:23.608
Just have a red delete in there.

00:07:23.608 --> 00:07:24.491
&gt;&gt; Oh I see.

00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:25.884
So you'd want to reveal a panel?

00:07:25.884 --> 00:07:30.990
&gt;&gt; Reveal a panel that says delete and
other options, potentially.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.760
&gt;&gt; But if we were to create
an edit UI like this,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.480
where when you tap on one of these
things you come to an edit UI,

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.570
you would see the title of the text,
the people.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.150
Would you expect to see a delete
button on that edit screen as well?

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.225
I would expect something like
a console to say that oh oops,

00:07:47.225 --> 00:07:50.331
I clicked on the new
event button by mistake.

00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:53.240
So I don't want to create a new event.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.030
Of course I know that the up
navigation takes you one page back.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:03.180
But I think a console button to just go
back to the home screen would be useful.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.240
&gt;&gt; Interesting,
you want a stronger affordance there.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.880
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.930
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.990
Well I really appreciate all
the feedback that you've given us.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.348
This is really helpful in setting
the direction and the tone for

00:08:11.348 --> 00:08:12.157
the next iteration.

00:08:12.157 --> 00:08:13.769
&gt;&gt; No problem
&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming out and helping.
