00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.630
I think you can see how to write
the algorithm at this point, but

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.560
just to be complete,
let me formalize it.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.080
First, my algorithm maintains two
copies of the rank and next buffers.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.355
You need two copies because the
interfaces to update ranks subroutines,

00:00:16.355 --> 00:00:18.125
always wrote their outputs
to a separate copy.

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:21.835
Remember that the extra copies
ensure that rights can happen

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:22.955
in parallels safely.

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:29.135
The algorithm itself basically just
does a sequence of sealing of log m

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:31.295
update and jump steps.

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:32.585
You can see the two copies here.

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:37.880
After we do the simultaneous update and
jump steps, we do a swap.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.000
There's one last step you need,
which is to return either R1 or

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.290
R2 depending on which was
the last copy updated.
