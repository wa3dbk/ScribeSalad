00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.550
Moving upstream, the boat would go at x minus 5 miles per hour, and moving

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.745
downstream, the boat would travel at x plus 5 miles per hour. Great thinking

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:12.526
for finding these two. Now, this one was pretty tough, so don't worry if you

00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:17.010
didn't get it right. The key lies in the speed of the current. We know the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.436
speed is five miles per hour. So, if the boat travels at x miles per hour, then

00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:25.404
with the current, it can go five miles per hour faster, that would be moving

00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:30.799
downstream. But against the current, we know the boat travels slower, so it

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:35.850
would lose the five miles per hour, since it's working against the current.
