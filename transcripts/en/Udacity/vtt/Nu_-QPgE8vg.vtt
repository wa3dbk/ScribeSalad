00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:04.132
Turns out that the lifetime is larger than the half-life.

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:13.832
One way to see this is the following: Look at this part of the exponential decay, and now rotate it by 180 degrees

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:22.466
to get this curve. If our decay looked like that, the lifetime would be equal to the given half-life.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:33.432
This and this average to the half-life. This and this average to the half-life, and this and this average to the half-life.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:39.132
And so on. But you see, the exponential decay extends far more to the right.

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:48.667
Actually, it goes to infinity. Some particles live really long, and this pushes up the value of the lifetime in comparison to the half-life.
