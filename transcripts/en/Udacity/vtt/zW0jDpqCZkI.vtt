00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.070
So, the Python Standard Library suggests that the

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.670
function open returns an object of the file

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.400
type. Now this word object is really interesting

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.930
because we have seen it before. Remember the time

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.980
when we were drawing squares using the class

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.490
Turtle? We were writing lines of code like this.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.630
This meant that Brad was an object or

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.340
instance of the class Turtle. Similarly, when we write

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.900
lines like this, which is quotes equal to open

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.680
file location, and the file, in our case, was

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.990
a movie quotes file. We are saying that quotes

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.560
is an object or an instance of file. Now let's

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.150
think for a moment, what happens when we run

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.590
this line of code. When we do run this

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.050
line of code, a function called _init_ is called

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.590
from inside the class Turtle. And what that does is

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.280
that it creates space in memory for the object Brad. Now in the case of open,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.350
even though on surface it looks like we

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.000
are merely calling a function, and that there

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.480
is no class involved. If you look deep down inside the code for how open was

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.910
actually implemented inside Python. We will find that

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.370
open, in turn, is calling some init-like function

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.410
to create an object of file. All right, that's enough

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.100
jargon for now. We will talk about instances and objects a

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.410
little bit later in the course. For now, we can rejoice

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.450
in the fact that part one of profanity checker is done.
