00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.570
Let's take a very simple
robot sensing problem, right?

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.058
So let's assume that a robot knows
the 3D map of its world, okay?

00:00:09.058 --> 00:00:09.578
And for now,

00:00:09.578 --> 00:00:12.240
we're just going to worry about
a robot running around on the floor.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.370
So it's not climbing stairs,
instead it's just running around.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.830
And let's assume also that it
has noisy depth sensors, so

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.510
it can measure depth in a lot
of different directions.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.140
And they're noisy, so the,
the measurement is uncertain, but

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.990
we know about the uncertainty.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.950
That is we have a sensor model.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.620
Okay?

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.910
And it moves between frames, and
it takes a, a set of readings, and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.960
then it moves again and takes a set
of readings, and it moves again.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.880
But the idea is it keeps
taking all these readings, and

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.100
the question is,
how well can it know its state?

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.740
So, what is its state?

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.280
Montana?.
No.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.790
Its state is three values, x,
y and theta, its orientation.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.350
Okay?
That's why we're just doing a,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.620
a multiple robot on
the ground three dimensions.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.460
All right?

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.540
So, just to remind you, on a Ba,
Bayesian filter framework,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.560
we need four things.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.000
We need some sort of the prior,
remember that trip to Delphi, so

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.160
you unpack your next prior.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.266
We need a dynamical system model and
that's the likelihood of landing in some

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:16.140
new place, given that you're in an old
place plus whatever action was taken.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.210
We need a sensor model, remember,
a likelihood that's the,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.910
not the probability of being
someplace given a measurement.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.580
The likelihood is the probability
of getting the measurement given

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.280
what your state was, and then we
need this stream of observations and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.570
the action data, the Zs and the Us.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.750
For that robot that I described,
the state is obvious.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.230
The map will be easy, et cetera.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.490
The thing that's tricky, not tricky,
the thing we have to define,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.060
is the sensor model.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.090
So here's a picture of a sensor model,
and what this is is,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.760
this is the probability of getting
a particular measurement if,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.380
let's say, the actual state was
here on this black line, okay?

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.200
And, what was nice is when
your using a real robot,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.420
you can actually measure the likelihood,
so

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.980
you, you, you stick the sensor,
you know, three meters away, or,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.170
let's see, it's at centimeters, so 200,
so 2.3 centimeters away from the wall.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.680
You turn it on,
you turn it on, you turn.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.630
You collect a whole bunch of
measurements and you see what you get.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.300
That distribution would
be this distribution.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.180
Okay?

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.570
And in fact,
the blue is what was measured.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.920
All right?
So that's why the blue's got

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.300
the noisy stuff.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.920
And the red is how they approximated it.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.900
And you can see they basically had
some sort of a Gaussian function or

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.970
something like that.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.970
In fact, you can see that the laser
has a less noise than the sonar, okay?

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.030
So, this is, this is actually
a relatively noisy laser.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.390
A modern laser would be,
you know, very precise.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.880
Except that you might have some
specular problem, et cetera.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.520
So all of that would be fine, except,
you'll notice there's this thing here

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.580
and this thing there, and the question
is, what's going on when, you know,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.950
the thing is 2.3 meters away and
here it says 500.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.510
But, the astute observer will notice
you're just using the very last value.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.070
Well what that really is,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.630
is that's the probability
that you get no return, okay?

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.280
So you're some distance from the wall,
you send out your sonar chirp, or

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.120
you send out your laser,
and it just goes away.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.460
Gets on a train, never comes back.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.110
This happens you guys know what
specular reflections are, right?

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.870
So when light bounces off to,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.280
turns out that sheet rock
is very specular to sonar.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.020
So when you send out a sonar chirp,
often it doesn't come back, it skips

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.010
like it reflects off, in which case,
you don't ever hear the chirp come back.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.360
Or it comes back after having
gone through a long echo path.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.130
Likewise, if you're looking at something
that's shiny, like a glass wall.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.340
When you point at it,
you can see the laser beam.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.870
But when you point it on the side, okay?

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.040
It'll be reflective.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.500
It'll be a specular.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.360
So what these values are,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.010
is the probability of getting no return
given that you're at some distance.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.850
And in fact, that probability stays
the same pretty much no matter what your

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.880
distance is.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.530
All right?

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.269
So remember, this is not the probability
that your distance is actually 500.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.579
It's the probability that
you would get this no return

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.350
at any given point in time, okay?

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.760
So we need to incorporate
that noisy model.
