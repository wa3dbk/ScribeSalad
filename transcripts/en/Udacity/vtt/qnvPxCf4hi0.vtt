00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.949
The greatest common factor, or the GCF is 1. These would be the prime factors

00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:09.641
for X squared, 5 X and 6. Notice how I have it listed all three of them don't

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:14.568
share a common factor, but we really know that we can multiply each of these by

00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:19.433
1. So, 1 is the only common factor shared between these 3 terms. If you ever

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:24.425
think that a group of terms doesn't have a common factor they actually do, and

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:25.283
it would be 1.
