00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.619
We can see here that the binomial we have is y minus z, which down here is going

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:11.436
to mean x minus 2. So that's what belongs in this first set of parantheses. Then

00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:16.954
the trinomial is y squared which is x squared why don't you substitute in x,

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:22.436
plus y c which is really x times 2, but I'm going to write that as 2x. And then

00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:26.706
plus z squared. Which is just plus 4. Awesome! I know it might feel a little bit

00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:30.600
silly to find a factorization that's so much more complicated than the initial

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.267
expression. But once we talk more about higher order polynomials, you'll

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:38.330
understand what the importance of writing out factorizations like this is. I'll

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.697
give you a hint that we've already talked about. Each linear factor is showing

00:00:42.697 --> 00:00:47.165
us an x-intercept of a graph. There's a ton of exciting stuff ahead. So just get

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:47.587
ready.
