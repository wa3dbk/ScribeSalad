00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.098
There are many variations of using textures to modify the surface's parameters

00:00:03.098 --> 00:00:06.700
in the lighting equation. Another way to vary the surface while calculating

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.262
illumination is to apply textures as light sources. We've seen how a skybox can

00:00:11.262 --> 00:00:15.314
be made to surround a scene. An extremely clever technique is to have surfaces

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:19.020
reflect the skybox. This technique is called reflection mapping, or sometimes

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.198
environment mapping. The basic idea is to make one object surrounding the world

00:00:23.198 --> 00:00:28.060
something that other objects can reflect. This is called the environment map.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.021
The illumination process is a bit like ray tracing, where a ray is reflected

00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:34.993
off a shiny surface and picks up color of any reflected objects. This

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:38.425
difference is that there is only one simple object to reflect, typically a cube

00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:42.166
map. Unlike a skybox, the environment map is only used when a shiny surface

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:46.156
needs a reflected color. You can certainly also put a skybox in a scene using

00:00:46.156 --> 00:00:49.600
the same cube map. This is commonly done in order to produce a convincing

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.491
effect. However, the environment map is a separate object that is part of the

00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:57.914
shiny object's material description. That said, skyboxes and reflection maps

00:00:57.914 --> 00:01:01.996
work using the same idea. You can think of a skybox as a physical object which

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:06.670
is what we usually do, or you can think of it as a texture function. What is

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.149
the color of the skybox in the direction the eye is looking? An environment map

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.804
is exactly the same only for reflected rays. What is the color of the

00:01:13.804 --> 00:01:18.655
environment map in the reflected direction? How it works is this. We render a

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:22.052
fragment on a reflective surface such as a sphere. We compute the usual

00:01:22.052 --> 00:01:26.657
elements as desired such as diffuse ambient and so on. For the environment map,

00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:30.520
we also need the direction to the eye and the shading normal at the fragment.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.592
These two vectors are used to compute the reflection direction which is then

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:37.564
used to find the texel on our environment map. This texel color can then be

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:41.100
blended in to the final color of the fragment. The color from the reflection

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.125
map makes the surface appear mirror like. The very simplest cube map to reflect

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:48.706
is one that's at infinity. Remember how a directional light came from a certain

00:01:48.706 --> 00:01:52.440
direction but was considered infinitely far away? Directional lights are

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.002
inexpensive to use because their direction vector never changes for any

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:58.745
surface. Similarly if you define an environment map as being at infinity,

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:01.695
you're saying that no matter where I am in my virtual world, when I look a

00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:04.945
certain direction I want to always get the same color back from my environment

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:10.704
map. To sum up, the reflection direction is computed for a reflective surface,

00:02:10.704 --> 00:02:14.891
and this direction is then used to access the environment map. This algorithm

00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:18.564
has limitations somewhat the reverse of the skybox. The reflected objects are

00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:22.544
always seen as being infinitely far away. For example, say you have a

00:02:22.544 --> 00:02:26.426
reflective sphere in a room represented by an environment map in a skybox. If

00:02:26.426 --> 00:02:28.820
you move the sphere from the center of the room to near a wall, the reflection

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.970
of the wall will not look closer. That said, reflection mapping is an

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.940
inexpensive way to add convincing visual detail to a model. Our eyes are

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.586
usually not very good at reversing the process of reflection. We see something

00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:43.776
reflected and our brains interpret the object we're viewing as being shiny. We

00:02:43.776 --> 00:02:46.571
don't waste brainpower trying to figure out if the reflections are perfectly

00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:49.280
correct, since in the real world they always are.
