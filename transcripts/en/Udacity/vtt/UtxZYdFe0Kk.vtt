00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
US cash definitely has universally recognized value.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
At least in the US, essentially everyone accepts it,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but even in other parts of the world, many people accept US cash.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It is easy to transfer.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You don't need to go to a bank or even interact with a bank in order to be able

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to transfer cash between individuals.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's sort of anonymous and untraceable--and I didn't check this one.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's definitely not designed to be untraceable.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Each bill has a unique number in it, and you could trace that number.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's untraceable in practice, because people don't tend to record those bill numbers,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but it's not untraceable technically.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's certainly the case when banks are robbed, and there's a sequence of bills

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that were marked in the same order,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that's one of the ways those bills might be detected.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's not light and portable. The largest currency in the US is a $100.00 bill.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That weighs the same as a $1.00 bill, which weighs about a third of a gram.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That means if you can carry 1 kilogram, that's only 2740 bills,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which would be over a quarter million dollars--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
not a bad amount of money for an individual to carry around,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but it certainly could become a factor if you're talking about large corporate transactions

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
where 1 kilogram weighs a quarter of a million dollars.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is one of many reasons why very few large cash transactions are done

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and you see scenes in movies were someone needs a whole briefcase full of money

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in order to do things.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The last question is whether it's hard to copy or forge,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and I think the answer to this is also really no. It's just paper.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The reason that it works is that the penalties for getting caught copying or forging are high.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The real answer is that it is hard to copy or forge in large quantities without getting caught.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Enforcement of counterfeiting is taken very seriously.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's done by the Secret Service that's also responsible for protecting the president.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The only people who can get away with forging US currency in large quantities,

00:01:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
are hostile countries where US law doesn't reach.
