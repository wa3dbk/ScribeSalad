00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.858
So we can also talk about near, total unconsciousness, coma for instance. In

00:00:05.858 --> 00:00:10.594
fact, a coma is brain activity so you're not dead.but its just one step up from

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:17.376
being dead. For instance, my brother back in the 90s was involved in a very

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:22.617
serious accident. He was riding his bike home from work. And the woman who was

00:00:22.617 --> 00:00:26.033
driving the car turned right into him, didn't see him, and he hit the

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:33.375
windshield. He went into a serious coma, very deep coma, for two weeks. And

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:37.297
then for about six months, he was vegetative. His eyes were open but he was

00:00:37.297 --> 00:00:42.734
still really quite non-responsive. So during this time, he went from near death

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:48.285
to a very gradual awakening in consciousness. In fact, I kept wondering what

00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:53.025
was he aware of? Was he aware of anything? Could he hear us? Could he think?

00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:56.140
Could he remember? We just didn't know.
