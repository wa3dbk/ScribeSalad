00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.705
The answer we get when we carry out this long division and rewrite the function

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:06.885
in this new way, is definitely different than what we would get if we had a

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:12.550
horizontal asymptote. But once again, we have a fraction as one of our terms.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.552
What value does this fraction 7 over x minus 2 get very close to as x heads to

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:19.779
infinity.
