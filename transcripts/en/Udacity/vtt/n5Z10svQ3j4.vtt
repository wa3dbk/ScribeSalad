00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's finish it off together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The variable_name or identifier name--they mean mostly the same thing--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is just the oneth component of this tuple.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The zeroth part was "identifier",

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so the oneth part is "x".

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So to get out the final value,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we're just going to call env_lookup,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
using our existing environment and the variable_name.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And whatever that gives us back, we'll just return.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And that's it. Now we can handle expressions

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
like (X + 2), assuming that we know what the value of (x) is

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
in our environment.
