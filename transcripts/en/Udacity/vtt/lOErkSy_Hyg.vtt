00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.710
&gt;&gt; Now of course, some of us do see this as a 3D shape.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.560
You can think of this as a paper folded here. One plane of the paper and

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.530
another plane of the paper. This looks kind of like an open book.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.900
This particular line here then can be ignored, just being a line of these two

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.620
planes, not signifying a surface by itself. If you view this only as a line,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.390
and not signifying a surface then it adverses David's first problem.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.070
But how do we address David's second problem of this being a fold or

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.440
a blade depending upon where we started constraint propagation from? The answer

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.160
is that we actually have a much more complex ontology of disconnections.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.120
The answer lies in the fact that we have so far used a very simple ontology,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.510
just to demonstrate the constraint propagation process. In reality the ontology

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.250
risk constraints is more complicated. Let's do Y-constraint may not just fold,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.718
fold and fold, but it might also be blade, blade and blade.

00:01:44.718 --> 00:01:49.160
And the L-constraint is not always blade and blade and fold and fold.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.648
It could also be blade and fold and fold and blade. Now we can see

00:01:52.648 --> 00:01:57.050
David's second problem disappearing, because the Y junction may have a blade and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.320
the L junction may also suggest a blade. And there is then no conflict. Let me

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.610
know that what we have shown here, is still not a full anthology of the Y, W,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.449
L and T constraints. T constraints in particular, may have additional

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:14.020
complexity. The advantage of having a more complete ontology is, that we can

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.060
use that ontology to interpret more complex scenes like this one, where there

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.040
are two rectangular objects, one being partially occluded by the other one.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.040
Of course, the more complicated ontology is not without its own problems.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.010
It now introduces ambiguities of a different kind. This particular junction.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.970
Is it now a blade, blade, blade, or is it a fold, fold,

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.620
fold? Both of them are permissible in the new complete ontology. In order to

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.650
resolve some of these ambiguities, we can come up with additional conventions.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.270
One convention is, that all of these edges that are next to the background,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.480
we'll consider them to be blades. So we'll make this a blade,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.940
blade, blade, blade. Once you make all these blades, then it's easy to

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.370
propagate the constraints. Notice this W junction could have been a fold, blade,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.620
fold, or a blade, fold, blade. But if we adopt the convention of labeling

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.300
all of these lines as blades, then, this W junction can only be blade, fold,

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.770
blade. But if this is a fold, this Y junction can only be fold, fold, fold, and

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.050
so on. And yet, helps us resolve the ambiguity of what this junction could be.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.150
This task of image interpretation is an instance of the abduction task.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.620
In abduction, we try to come up with the best explanation for the data.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.250
This is the data, we're trying to interpret it in terms of an explanation.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.400
We'll discuss abduction in more detail when we come to diagnosis. Well

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.080
now notice that, we start with what we know. Blade, blade, blade. And that we

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.550
propagate the constraints, so that we can disambiguate between other junctions.
