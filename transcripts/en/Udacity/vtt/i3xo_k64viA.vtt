00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.499
So welcome to the Lean Launchpad class.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.232
If you're interested in the logistics on how to take this class,

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:08.599
this lecture zero will describe it. But if you want to just get started,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.166
click on lecture one. So the good news is there's actually

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:14.499
four ways to watch these lectures:

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.566
So a good way is to kind of watch them and use the Udacity

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:21.832
discussion forums to interact with other people watching these lectures.

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:24.799
Something that's better is, these lectures are free and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.832
they don't really require any books or text.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.666
But there are books or texts, and I would feel a little guilty

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:34.366
not telling you that Alexander Osterwalder's "Business Model Generation"

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:38.066
book is kind of the standard for understanding the business model canvas,

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:40.832
and The Startup Owner's Manual, written by yours truly

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:44.732
and my co-author, Bob Dorf, is kind of the standard for customer development.

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.066
But let me emphasize again, these are not required,

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:49.799
and you could understand the lectures just fine without them.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.832
But they certainly help explain a lot of the detail in the

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:57.599
617 pages, because it's almost an encyclopedia for startups.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.832
Enough of the ad--that's the last time I'll mention buying

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:03.866
the texts or books. Almost best is to actually watch these

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:06.732
lectures, but this time form a startup team and actually

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.766
think about--instead of just sitting in your office or on your

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:14.232
computer--actually be watching these as you start your company.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:17.166
Now, the best way to actually watch these lectures

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:20.199
is with facilitators and coaches and mentors.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.632
and the way you can do that is by physically taking the

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:27.432
class with Startup Weekend Next. If you go to the website,

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:31.866
swnext.org, you could find out how to sign up in your city

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:36.099
and town, and participate as a team, with groups of other teams

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.132
physically, week to week.

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.766
and one of the reasons we kind of suggest that you,

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:44.232
instead of just watching the lectures, actually get out of

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:48.032
the building and do it--either by yourself or with your team,

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:52.332
or with Startup Weekend--is startups are not about lectures.

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:55.066
And entrepreneurship is not about your grades,

00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:59.399
and this class is about the work you do outside the building

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.266
after you watch the lectures, not how much of the lectures you watch.

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:07.999
Entrepreneurship is experiential, it's hands-on,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.167
and it's immediate and intense feedback.
