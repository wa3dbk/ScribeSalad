This is part two of our one cycle quiz. We are back to what is the state

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.200
of the processor at the beginning of this cycle. The question for you is,

at the end of this cycle, what is in reservation stations? In particular,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.120
is this reservation station still busy? Is this one still busy? Is this one

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.400
going to be used? What is in the three fields and what is in these two fields?
