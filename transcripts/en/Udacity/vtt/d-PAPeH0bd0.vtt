00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.830
And the answer is, because n is a str but we're

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.950
treating it like an int. Let's look at our code again. So

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.050
on our code here, we're getting from the request and we're

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.814
just storing on th, in the variable n here. Now the problem

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:15.800
is, when things come out of the requests there're always strings.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.590
So if we want a, if we want to be an integer,

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.830
we need to make it an integer. Let's go ahead and do

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.420
that. So basically, if n was specified, convert it into an integer.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.630
Now let's see if it works in our browser.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.860
Okay, here we are, N equals 1. I'm going

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.000
to hit Enter, and N indeed equals 1. And if we set it to something else, N does

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.500
not equal 1. And if I set it to

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.080
a string, we don't get anything. And actually what

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.620
really happened, is we got an error because we

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.140
tried to convert the string Steve into an integer and

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.920
Python did not like that. We're not going to go ahead and fix that,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.160
but what I wanted to show you, was that when you expect an

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.880
integer as a parameter from user, you need to actually convert it. because

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.750
the web application, or the browsers, or the HTTP has no idea what's an

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.680
integer and what's a string, so you have to actually do that check

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.190
yourself. And if we want to make that previous example work, we would have to

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.520
check to see is the string all digits first, and then, only then

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.240
convert it to an integer. So, it's a common mistake, I actually, I made

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.563
it when I was doing this lesson in the first place,

00:01:18.563 --> 00:01:20.990
and so I thought I would let you see it as well.
