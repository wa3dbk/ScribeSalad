00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay--onto a new concept: this is the concept of Validation.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Validation basically means

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
verifying, on the Server side, that what we received

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is what we expected to receive.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So we have you, and we have our Servers--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and you're submitting to our form certain values.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's say you're sending the "q" parameter.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's a checkbox that we've put on our form

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and its value equals "on".

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And the Server receives that and knows what to do if "q" equals "on",

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and it knows what to do if "q" is not present--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you know--that means the checkbox wasn't checked.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But what if there's a bad guy

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and he's wearing a hat, and he submits to our Server

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the "q" parameter--but instead of equaling "on" or not being present,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
he submits the word, "broken"?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, depending on how our Server is programmed--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you know--it can just say

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
oh, well I don't know what "broken" means

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
so I'm just going to assume it's unchecked,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which is probably the smart thing to do.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And that's great.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The point I'm trying to make, however,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is that just because we have a form with a checkbox on it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that limits what a user can send us--through the form--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
it doesn't mean that somebody can't send, directly to our Server,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
parameters with arbitrary junk in them.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And it's up to our Server to make sure that we handle it safely.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Always remember that your Server can receive junk

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and it needs to be smart enough

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to deal with somebody sending completely broken data.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And it doesn't necessarily have to be the string, "broken", right?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This could be a megabyte of trash,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and you don't want to just blindly do something with it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So make sure you're always validating your parameters,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and that's what we're going to talk about now.
