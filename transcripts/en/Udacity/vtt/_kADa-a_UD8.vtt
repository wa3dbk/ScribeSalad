00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.428
So, influential people have high Klout scores like the president and Justin

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:09.210
Bieber. Now, let's say we looked up the Klout scores of 35 people who use the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.280
app Bieber Tweeter, which automatically retweets Justin Bieber whenever he

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.268
tweets anything. If you don't know, a tweet is a message that people write on

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:22.752
the social networking site Twitter. And the Klout score is partly based off of

00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:27.676
people's Twitter activity. So, let's say that the average Klout score of these

00:00:27.676 --> 00:00:33.872
people is 40. Where does this mean fall on the distribution of sample means for

00:00:33.872 --> 00:00:39.714
other samples of size 35? So, just to recap, you found that the standard

00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:46.288
deviation of this distribution is 2.71. So, how many standard deviations above

00:00:46.288 --> 00:00:50.258
the mean of this distribution does this mean lie?
