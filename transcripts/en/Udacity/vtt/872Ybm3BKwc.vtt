I'm here with Kevin Mayo.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.010
He is a graduate of the Frontend
nano degree program, and

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.850
he is now a Frontend
engineer here at Udacity.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.070
So Kevin, I wanted you to
talk to our students about

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.250
what you do when you
are learning a new technology.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.070
Where do you go?

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.850
What sort of resources
do you find helpful?

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.595
So I guess that's one of the skills that
I picked up from the nano degree is,

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:32.240
when you're trying to learn something
new, I usually go right to the official

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.470
documentation or official site,
whatever the technology has set up.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.190
Pretty good nowadays about giving you
a little tutorial, code example, and

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.780
like, good documentation,
because basically, there's so

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.680
many new things coming out that if
you don't provide good documentation,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.910
nobody's going to use your technology.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.710
So, that's like,
the best place to start, and

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.360
just get some kind of a feel for it.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.510
And then obviously you're going to
have questions, or I always do.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.700
So then that's when you can
go to the Udacity forums.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.790
You can go to Stack Overflow,
just Google things.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.720
But usually I like to jump as
quickly as possible into a project,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.930
so it can be a simple to do app.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.200
Everybody does those.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.580
Or like a Udacity project.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.020
That's a great starting point too.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.284
And just kind of go,
trying to actually build something,

00:01:30.284 --> 00:01:33.640
that's where you'll
start to have questions.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.300
And you're kind of forced to learn.
