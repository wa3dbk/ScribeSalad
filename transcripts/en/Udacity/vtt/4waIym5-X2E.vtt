Hi! I'm Miriam and I'll be the assistant instructor for CS222.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, I personally think that Math matters a lot but I know there's some skeptics out there

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so hopefully by the end of this course you'll know better.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is the first course that I'm working at Udacity and I'm really, really excited to be part of it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Aside from the fact that I really love Math and Physics and learning about pretty much anything,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm a yoga teacher and I really love to bake anything. I'm not really into cooking though.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I really only like baking sweet things like pie and cake and brownies and cheesecake

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and kind of anything that taste good.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In terms of this course, I'll be helping you guys out on the forums

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and by filming to explain the problem sets.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So now that you know a little bit more about me, I'm looking forward to seeing you in the forums

00:00:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and good luck in the class.
