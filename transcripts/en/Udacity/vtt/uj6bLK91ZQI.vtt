00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.960
What we will do first is make a

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.350
variable called logged price, the log of diamond price.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.920
And then we will build our model similarly to

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.610
the way that we did for the small diamond

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.140
status set. Notice that we're setting price by diamonds

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.300
who's price is less than $10,000 and who's certificate

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.010
is G.I.A.. Thankfully our models look quite a bit

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.050
like they did for the smaller diamond status set.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.620
Although our r squared values are just a touch weaker.
