00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.876
We've already seen the number negative i, so presumably we can put different

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:09.842
real coefficients in front of i. 3i for example, is equal to just i plus i plus

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:14.894
i, or 3 i added together. So again imaginary numbers operate in pretty much the

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:19.692
same way as real numbers. Thinking about this, what do you think we get if we

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:24.540
square 3i, apply the same rules that you know worked for real numbers. Real

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.293
numbers, and simplify this answer as much as you can.
