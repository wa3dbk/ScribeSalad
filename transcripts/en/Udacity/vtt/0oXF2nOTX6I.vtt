00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.553
So student Lisa asks, what would be different in

00:00:02.553 --> 00:00:04.277
world where almost everyone was programming

00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:07.451
literate. So this is the core question and obviously

00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:09.577
I feel that it would be great to have such a world

00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:11.571
thatÃ¢Â€Â™s why we are trying to encourage as many

00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:13.651
people as possible to take this class and hope

00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:16.364
youÃ¢Â€Â™ll encourage any non programming literate

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:19.254
people that you know to take the next version in

00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:21.438
this class starting in April.

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:23.272
There are lots of things that understanding

00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:27.087
programming even at just a basic level and I think

00:00:27.087 --> 00:00:29.522
many of you are beyond the basic level now if

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:32.377
youÃ¢Â€Â™ve made it this far in CS101, but in terms of

00:00:32.377 --> 00:00:34.337
the things that you interact with and the things that

00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:36.438
you see in the world, almost all of them are

00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:38.608
controlled by programs these days and people

00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:41.309
who understand programming can relate to those

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.635
things and have better way than people who donÃ¢Â€Â™t.

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:46.016
And some of this can be sort of fairly obvious

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:48.172
things when you interact with a website and you

00:00:48.172 --> 00:00:50.472
can tell, well theyÃ¢Â€Â™ve got some bugging it because

00:00:50.472 --> 00:00:52.787
the programmer didnÃ¢Â€Â™t think of that both branches

00:00:52.787 --> 00:00:56.279
of the NIFT test and if you are a programmer or

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:59.486
you at least understand about programming that

00:00:59.486 --> 00:01:01.414
you maybe have a better sense of what is going

00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:03.957
on but you also can get a lot more familiar by it

00:01:03.957 --> 00:01:05.782
because you know well this is something any

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:06.986
programmer who knows what they are doing

00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:08.599
should have test before and understand whatÃ¢Â€Â™s

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:10.975
going on and itÃ¢Â€Â™s really annoying that you have to

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:13.243
deal with their mistake.

00:01:13.243 --> 00:01:14.611
Other things you probably have a better

00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:16.363
understanding of how complicated it is and how

00:01:16.363 --> 00:01:19.567
hard it is to get things right that you might be a

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:21.678
little more forgiving when things break and have

00:01:21.678 --> 00:01:24.122
better ideas about well this is probably why itÃ¢Â€Â™s

00:01:24.122 --> 00:01:26.682
breaking, letÃ¢Â€Â™s try to use this tool or use this

00:01:26.682 --> 00:01:29.000
product in some slightly different way. So thatÃ¢Â€Â™s

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.151
one of the reasons. The other reason I think is

00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:33.179
there are lots of things that people encounter

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.450
every day that if you know a little bit about

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.309
programming instead of doing a lot of tedious work

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:41.399
as a human you can find a way to automate that

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:42.822
and save yourself a lot ofÃ¢Â€Â¦

00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:44.546
There is a good example of this right here in our

00:01:44.546 --> 00:01:46.775
office. So when recording these video we generate

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:48.928
hundreds every week to get the classes out for all

00:01:48.928 --> 00:01:52.312
these courses and they are all named kind of

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:55.741
default things by the video camera and video X, X,

00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.443
X, 1, 2, 4 and whatever but what we need to do

00:01:58.443 --> 00:02:00.389
that is that organize them like date and time and

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:02.504
course and what not. And so whenever video

00:02:02.504 --> 00:02:04.437
editors wrote script, weÃ¢Â€Â™d just kind of the

00:02:04.437 --> 00:02:06.232
programming that you got from here and a little bit

00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:08.512
previously to do this automatically. Whenever we

00:02:08.512 --> 00:02:10.955
record videos we just give it to her and she sorts it

00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:13.171
automatically and saves the video editors hours of

00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:14.586
time.

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:17.700
Okay, thatÃ¢Â€Â™s great and I think people once you get

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.147
a little experience with programming youÃ¢Â€Â™ll see

00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:22.293
things like that every day that youÃ¢Â€Â™re seeing people

00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:23.975
could be yourself but itÃ¢Â€Â™ll less often be yourself

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:26.783
spending their time doing tedious things that are

00:02:26.783 --> 00:02:28.645
not fun for humans. That you could write a few

00:02:28.645 --> 00:02:32.647
lines of python code to solve and so I hope, at the

00:02:32.647 --> 00:02:34.053
end of this class and I think by this point in the

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.872
class many of you really should be at a level

00:02:35.872 --> 00:02:37.788
where youÃ¢Â€Â™re instead of just solving the problems

00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:39.688
that weÃ¢Â€Â™re giving you in the homeworks, youÃ¢Â€Â™re

00:02:39.688 --> 00:02:41.307
finding real problems in your life and in your

00:02:41.307 --> 00:02:43.750
friends lives that you can solve by writing a little bit

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.507
of code. So, I hope everyone will be doing that and

00:02:47.507 --> 00:02:50.918
spreading the value of programming literacy

00:02:50.918 --> 00:02:52.506
beyond that, beyond just yourself.
