00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.590
All right. 
And here's the solution.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.220
To start off, let's look 
at our forecast fragment query.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.480
Since it's a join between two tables,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.240
it's really easy for us to add 
additional parameters to our query.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.870
Now we make sure we keep 
the column indices consistent.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.776
Now we've grabbed the latitude 
and longitude at the same time

00:00:17.776 --> 00:00:19.462
we're grabbing our weather entries.

00:00:19.462 --> 00:00:22.740
The next thing to do is to move 
the function open preferred location

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.640
in map over to forecast fragment.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.230
Instead of using shared preferences 
to get these values, we can actually

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.870
get the cursor from the forecast adapter.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.950
We can get our cursor moved 
to a reasonable position,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.160
and then build our new string 
which is just latitude colon longitude.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.340
We'll leave our comment where it was.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.720
Finally, we just have to fix up 
a few things in the code and that's it.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.483
Well, at least for the code. 
We still need to do some work

00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:49.366
in the XML.

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.150
Let's move this R.ID.action map

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.850
now over to forecast fragment inside

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.360
of it on options item selected.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.420
And now we've got 
to do some XML work.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.260
Let's look at our main menu. 
We'll just pull this action map item out,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.620
and we'll place it right 
into forecast fragment.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.030
All right. 
One more thing to do while we're here.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.960
One of the things Raito talked about

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.780
was wanting to get rid of 
the refresh menu item.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.850
So, let's just comment it out.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.510
When we remove that action refresh item, 
we should probably comment it out

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.170
from our source code too. 
After all, you never know

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.263
when you'll want to use that 
for debugging.

00:01:24.263 --> 00:01:27.036
So, there we have it, our final app.

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:29.200
No longer having a refresh button.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.510
With new exciting setting 
to turn off and on weather notifications.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.180
Details are taken care of. 
I hope you've enjoyed building Sunshine.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.080
There's still lots of things left 
to do in Sunshine.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.390
For example, we could also add 
a lot more intelligent things

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.200
to its user interface. 
And of course, we could make it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.300
a lot smarter about syncing data.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.200
And I hope the practices 
you've learned building Sunshine

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.533
will help you in all 
of your future applications
