00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.192
Your task was to write the average method that computes the average of a bunch

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:09.060
of fuel efficiencies. Now, of course that's almost exactly the same as

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.140
computing the average of a bunch of areas. So let's copy and paste this code.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.409
And there are only two spots where I need to fix it up. Over here instead of

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:23.226
country, it should say car. And over here instead of calling getArea, I should

00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:28.678
call getFuelEfficiency. And that's all. This is, of course, intensely boring,

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:31.363
and there ought to be a better way.
