00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.170
In this lesson,

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.240
I'm going to introduce you to another
great framework called AVFoundation.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.180
The AV stands for audio and video.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.480
It is the audio part we're going
to look at in more detail.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.740
In particular, we're going to use
a class called AVAudioEngine.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.350
That'll let us record audio,
mix and alter it, and play it back.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.560
Here, we can see our application,
Pitch Perfect, on the top of the stack.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.710
On the bottom is the Audio Hardware,
that's going to record and

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.160
play back the audio.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.050
To use it, we're going to go through
the AVFoundation framework, and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.480
in particular, the AVAudioEngine class.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.240
Ready?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.400
Let's get to recording some audio.
