00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:06.260
So, now we're in a good position to finally define this notion

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.159
of NP-completeness that I mentioned in the beginning of the unit.

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:10.626
We can say some problem X is NP-complete if it satisfies two properties.

00:00:10.626 --> 00:00:15.893
First, it has to be NP-hard, meaning that nothing

00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:19.524
in NP is harder then X. Which is to say that if you could

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:24.376
solve X in polynomial time, you could use it to solve everything in NP in polynomial time.

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:27.675
And the second important property is that X

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:33.492
itself is in NP. So its in the set and its as hard as anything in the set.

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:37.042
So, it is in fact the hardest in this set.

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:39.675
And though it may seem a little weird to satisfy

00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:43.942
both of these at the same time, there are actually tons of problems known to be NP-complete.

00:00:43.942 --> 00:00:49.044
Very often when you go to solve some, to develop some kind of algorithm to solve

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:53.125
a problem and there just doesn't feel like there is anyway to get a foothold

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:58.075
on it, uh, its a good idea to check: is NP-hard and is it in NP?

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:03.292
If so, its NP-complete. And, uh, at this point now, tons of problems are known to be NP-complete.

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:06.742
There is lists, there are online websites that list lots of problems.

00:01:06.742 --> 00:01:13.439
There's wonderfully written books that layout problem after problem after problem.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.721
And sometimes they are really natural extensions of each other and

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:20.522
sometimes its really quite interesting to see how they are connected to each other.

00:01:20.522 --> 00:01:24.273
Saying that some problem is NP-complete tells us an awful lot about that problem.

00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:28.607
So, let's imagine there is some problem called graph partitioning - which is a real problem.

00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:31.890
And it is related to social networks.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.489
But, I'm not going to tell you what it is, but I will tell you that its NP-complete.

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:39.907
Even if you don't know what it is, there are some things that you do know by the virtue of the fact

00:01:39.907 --> 00:01:44.057
that is is NP-complete, assuming that you believe me, you'd know the following:

00:01:44.057 --> 00:01:47.522
which of these, check all that apply, which of these do you know?

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:50.922
if I tell you that graph-partitioning is NP-complete does that mean its

00:01:50.922 --> 00:01:55.590
NP-hard and therefore a polynomial time solution for that problem

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.657
solves everything in NP.

00:01:57.657 --> 00:02:01.622
Do we know that the problem clique can be reduced to it?

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:04.889
Given what we've said so far about what we've said so far about clique.

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:12.706
Do we know that graph partitioning is in NP, and therefore an exponential time solution would exist?

00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:22.240
Do we know that it can be reduced to SAT, based on the things I've told you about SAT in this unit?

00:02:22.240 --> 99:59:59.999
Check all that apply.
