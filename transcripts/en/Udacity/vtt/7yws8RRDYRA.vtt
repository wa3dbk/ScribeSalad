00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.530
Looking at the figure, I can see I'm going to need to go to the right somehow

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.090
to get to the R vector. The V vector looks like a good place to start negated.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.798
I put a negative 1 for this V vector. That got me going to the right. Now I

00:00:10.798 --> 00:00:14.236
need to go upwards. I could add the vector N twice, but this would take me too

00:00:14.236 --> 00:00:18.730
high. After adding N just once, I can see that I'm above the mirror surface. So

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.814
another N would take me beyond my goal of R. The vector dN looks like a winner

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:27.283
as this is essentially just the Y component of the V vector. Adding it to the

00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:31.268
negated V vector is the same as simply moving to the right. Adding dN twice

00:00:31.268 --> 00:00:35.887
gets us to the R vector, so two dN vectors are needed. The final formula then

00:00:35.887 --> 00:00:39.902
is R equals 2 times dN minus V or to expand out R equals 2 times the dot

00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:44.183
product of V and N, times N minus V.
