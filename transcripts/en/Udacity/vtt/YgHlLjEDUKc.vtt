00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.859
In the section on error handling,

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:07.610
we used the @objc attribute to expose an
enum of type ErrorType to Objective-C.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.460
When I place that modifier in
front of this particular enum,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.950
the compiler doesn't like it very much.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.653
Okay, let's see what
the compiler has to say here.

00:00:17.653 --> 00:00:22.670
@objc enum raw type 'String'
is not an integer type.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.490
So I'm reminded to change
this to an integer.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.600
And of course I have to change
the values to integers, too, and

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.271
the error goes away.

00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:36.807
And now I'm able to access these
error codes from the parts of my

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:39.310
project that are written in Objective-C.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.810
These compiler errors
can be really helpful

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.900
because they flag code that would
otherwise be silently ignored.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.367
For example, let's say we're
back in our house class and

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:52.430
we've added a Swift struct
to represent a hot tub.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.615
If I mark this HotTub struct with
an @objc attribute, I see an error.

00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:01.660
@objc can't be applied
to this declaration.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.160
And of course I'm reminded that
Objective-C can't consume structs.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.990
So I edit my HotTub to be a class.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.120
I make sure it inherits from NSObject.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.830
I edit these functions a little bit.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.110
And now when I add the @objc attribute,
I don't see that error any more.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.080
I can see that there's no problem.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.120
Although, now that HotTub
inherits from NSObject,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.140
I actually don't need
the @objc attribute any more.
