00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.834
What did you come up with for your answers? Hopefully, you had zero major

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:10.067
decisions that you had to make today. As for the number of minor decisions, I

00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:16.149
started counting and lost track well after 35. In addition to decisions, we

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.770
also have judgments that we make throughout the day. So when we say things

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.820
like, it is unlikely, or chances are, or even I decided, we are judging how

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.410
likely something is to happen. That is, its probability.
