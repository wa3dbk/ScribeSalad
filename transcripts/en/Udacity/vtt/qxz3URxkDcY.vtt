00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So here we have the remove min heap function.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There's different ways to implement this, but this is just a simple two-line way.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So, first what we do is we pop the last element from the list,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and then we replace that by putting it in the position of the first element.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This effectively removes the minimum element.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And then the only other thing we have to do is run down-heapify on the first element

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to make sure we maintain the heap property.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, as a simple example, if we just wrote

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
apply or remove min heap function to this heap,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
what it will do is it will take the last element here

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and move it up to the top, removing the minimum element.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Then all we have to do is apply the down-heapify function.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So what we do is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
we swap the 4 and the 1 here, and then we swap the 4 and the 3.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That's the remove min heap function.
