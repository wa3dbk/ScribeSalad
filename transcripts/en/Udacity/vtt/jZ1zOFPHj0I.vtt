00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.370
Let's talk about the project you'll
be working on in this course.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.860
You'll be using some common development,
packaging, deployment, and

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.160
monitoring tools to build a smooth
work flow for building and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.980
launching changes to a web application.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.660
Although you'll be working by yourself,
we'll talk about how you'll be able to

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.160
apply the ideas you learned here to
your own work place or future projects.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.270
You'll start with fixing
a common problem,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.260
difference between development and
production environment, by

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.890
creating golden images that can be used
by developers and on production alike.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.740
Then you'll step into the shoes of a
developer and use the golden image from

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.590
the previous step to launch a local
development server for a web app.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.860
After that you'll build out
a continuous integration service.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.045
A system that will watch for

00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:46.910
check-ins of new code and automatically
run tests and package it up.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.680
Then you go back to the developer role
and see how pushing your changes to your

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.900
team repository automatically makes
changes to the integration environment.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.400
And since you can't improve what you
can't measure, you'll configure a simple

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.350
monitoring system that will allow you
to see how your system is performing.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.180
You'll also see how the perspective
of what important things to monitor,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.340
depends on the role you're playing.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.670
This, of course, is not the only way to
implement some of the DevOps principles

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880
in an organization or a project.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.465
But, it will give you
a practical overview and

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:18.290
let you walk in the shoes of
different people for awhile.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.365
Will help you better understand some
of challenges other teams faced,

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:24.465
teach you how to communicate with them
better and how to work together to solve

00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:26.285
the problems you're facing
in your everyday work.
