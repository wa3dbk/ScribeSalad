00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.000
So I approach adding new features in

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.260
a way that I try to be very
specific about what I'm adding.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.840
Because, of course,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.220
you could have a redesign of an
application that has a number of things.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.230
But, I think it's important to
focus on one item at a time.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.900
So if you're adding an image to a view
or you're adding several buttons or

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.220
a layout, it's good to accomplish those
individual pieces first and then,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.880
kind of, just get something that
works and then evolve that over time.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.710
The general thing I'm trying to avoid
is you can get into a rabbit hole of

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.590
everything needs to be refactored.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.040
And you refactor one thing and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.160
you start to pull other threads because
you start to change something else, and

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.170
then at the of the day you
don't have anything done.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.300
So it's important to stay very focused
on improving one area of the code base

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.740
and then just finishing that.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.200
Even if there's things that you kind of
use as scaffolding, like you know it's

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.890
going to tear down later as you improve
other features, that's okay, it's okay

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.595
to tear that out later, but it's
good to just focus on that one item.

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:58.165
When I plan out
implementing new features,

00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:00.435
it depends on how large that feature is.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.995
If it's a large feature then
I'll generally do some amount of

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:03.725
project planning.

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:07.415
Like you'll say, okay, well this might
take me weeks so I'll schedule it into

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:11.635
sprints, and start to get an idea of
what I'll tackle for those weeks.

00:01:11.635 --> 00:01:13.385
If it's a smaller item,
I kind of do that in my head.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:15.706
I'll say, I know,
I need to do this one activity first and

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:18.435
then transition to the other one and
kind of build those over time.
