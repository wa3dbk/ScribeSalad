00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:07.111
In Problem Set number 6, you will be implementing a fast parallel algorithm for seamless image cloning.

00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:14.216
Seamless image cloning is a modern algorithm for pasting one image into another in a very subtle way.

00:00:14.216 --> 00:00:17.227
Here is an example of seamless image cloning.

00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:20.019
For example, you have a bear, a swimming pool.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.891
With seamless image cloning, you now have a polar bear in a swimming pool.

00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:26.928
Our algorithm for seamless image cloning uses

00:00:26.928 --> 00:00:32.503
a technique called "double buffering" to iteratively compute a solution.

00:00:32.503 --> 00:00:37.008
The main idea behind double buffering in the context of this homework

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:42.834
is that we store an approximate solution to a problem in one buffer.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:50.959
Then we use that approximate solution to compute a better solution which we will store in another buffer.

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:53.695
Then we go in the other direction,

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:56.005
computing an even better solution,

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.228
and store that solution in the first buffer.

00:00:59.228 --> 00:01:06.335
After going back and forth many times, we will arrive at an ideal solution to our problem.

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:10.840
This style of computation arises in many parallel algorithms,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.843
which is why we think it will make a really interesting homework assignment.

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:21.748
Before we implement seamless image cloning, let's take a closer look at our inputs.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:27.956
We are given as inputs a source image, a target image, and a mask.

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:34.704
We want to copy the masked value from the source image into the target image in a subtle way.

00:01:34.704 --> 00:01:42.367
To do this, we hard code the values on the inside border of the masked region to be the same as the target image,

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:51.210
then what we do is to solve for the unknown pixel values in the strict interior of the masked region.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.687
How do we find these unknown pixel values in the strict interior portion of the masked image?

00:01:57.687 --> 00:01:59.022
We can do that as follows.

00:01:59.022 --> 00:02:05.762
First step, we will make a guess for the unknown pixel values, and that's called our initial guess I0.

00:02:05.762 --> 00:02:08.517
I0 doesn't have to be a very good guess,

00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:16.026
so we can set I0 to be all zeros in the strict interior portion of our masked image.

00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:22.865
But note that 0 will be a very bad guess, because it would not be very subtle

00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:26.309
and it also would not conform to the source image very well.

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:31.113
Now suppose we are given a guess solution IK to our problem,

00:02:31.113 --> 00:02:35.846
we can compute a better guess IK + 1 as follows.

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:44.319
For some pixel i(k + 1) in I(k + 1) in the strict interior region of the mask,

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.894
we can compute the value of i of K + 1 as A + B + C divided by D.

00:02:51.894 --> 00:02:57.440
And let's go through each of A and B and C and D one at a time.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.103
A is the sum of iK's neighbors.

00:03:01.103 --> 00:03:05.707
We don't include iK in the sum, and we only include iK's neighbors

00:03:05.707 --> 00:03:10.087
if they are in the strict interior portion of the masked region.

00:03:10.087 --> 00:03:15.584
B is the sum of t's neighbors where t is the corresponding pixel value in the target image,

00:03:15.584 --> 00:03:18.387
and the target image in our case is the swimming pool.

00:03:18.387 --> 00:03:24.058
And we only include t's neighbors if they are in the inside border of the masked region.

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:30.337
And C is the sum of the difference between S and S's neighbors

00:03:30.337 --> 00:03:34.806
where S in this case is the corresponding pixel value in the source image

00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:38.174
and the source image in our case is the polar bear.

00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:43.479
Finally, D is the number of iK's neighbors,

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.479
and iK's neighbors can be less than 4 if iK is on the border of the image.
