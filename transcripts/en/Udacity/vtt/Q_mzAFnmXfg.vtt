00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.204
Sum of squares for between group variability, and within group variability, add

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:10.769
to the total sum of squares, 54 plus 6 equals 60. You learned this is the last

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.740
lesson, but I just wanted to remind you. And remember that the total sum of

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.150
squares is the sum of each square deviation of each value and all the samples

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.210
from the grand mean.
