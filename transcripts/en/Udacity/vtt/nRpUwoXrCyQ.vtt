00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.359
In the last quiz, we started off by multiplying both sides by x, since that's

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.931
the denominator of this first fraction. But what if instead we picked 5x? That

00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:13.351
was after all the common denominator that we used the first time around that we

00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:18.076
tried this problem. So please, in these two boxes, fill in what the left-hand

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:22.684
side and the right-hand side of this equation will be if we multiply each side

00:00:22.684 --> 00:00:27.240
by 5x. Again, you can simplify within either side as much as you want to.
