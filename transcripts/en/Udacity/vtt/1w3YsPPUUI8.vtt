00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.520
Inherent in any component technology is that technology's component model,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.810
also called the component's framework.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.470
A component model is a set of shared assumptions about the component syntax,

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.640
semantics and composition.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.740
Component syntax includes how components are specified,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.848
which need not be in the same language as the one in which they are implemented.

00:00:21.848 --> 00:00:26.360
The semantics prescribes what information is in the component's contract and

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.810
what is the nature of the environment in which the component runs.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.360
Component composition specifies how components work with other components.
