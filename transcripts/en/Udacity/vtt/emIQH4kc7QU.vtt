00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.250
So what I'm now going to do is--I'm going to take the structure here, make it a bit smaller like this

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.710
and take away the NP here, and we are going to reappear in a minute.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.250
What I'm now going to do is I'm going to put a bunch of these structures together.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.430
So connect this one edge, connect this one edge, and we're also going to do one here

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.990
and now call this one A and this one B.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.050
Now, what you see here is that I have taken three structures like these

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.550
and put them between A and B.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.020
I'm going to do this more generally now.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.190
Imagine that instead of an edge here, I could have more of these structures.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.160
I'll just write three dots here and these will represent

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.030
additional copies of this structure being in between here.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.760
So in total, I will have n copies of the structure--n times this structure here appears between A and B.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.020
And now my question is, how many shortest paths between A and B

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.780
can you have that visit all of the vertices here.

00:00:53.780 --> 99:59:59.000
If you have n copies of that structure, is that n², is that 2^n, or is that 2n.
