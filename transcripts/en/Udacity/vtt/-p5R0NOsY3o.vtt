00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The first part of our return value is just the word function.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is to separate it from a number like 3 or 4

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and to allow us to tell if the user mistakenly tries to call something

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that's not a function later.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We then list the parameters which we got right from the abstract syntax tree,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the body of the function, which we also got right from the abstract syntax tree,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the environment in which it was defined--this one, env.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And we're passing in env here instead of some global environment or whatnot

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and this is what's going to allow local functions to see local variables.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is why things like makegreeter work.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
They can refer back to variables that were currently in scope

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
when they were defined.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Many of you may notice a striking similarity between this and our previous code

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
for handling function declarations.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
In fact, our previous code just had 1 more step

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
where we added this value to the environment.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
For an anonymous function, we don't add it to the environment

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
unless the user assigns it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But this code should look really, really familiar.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We have something almost exactly like it for handling functions at the top level

00:01:05.000 --> 09:59:59.000
as JavaScript elements.
