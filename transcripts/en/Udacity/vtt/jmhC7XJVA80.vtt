00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This example is actually maybe a little bit easier

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and probably a little bit more useful and interesting.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What we'd like to do is count the number of steps that it takes to run

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
naive as a function of a.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Just as before, I'd like you to write your answer as a function time

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that we can run, give different inputs to, and evaluate it that way.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Function time should take as input a, and it should return the number of steps.

00:00:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
it takes to execute naive(a, b) as a function of a.
