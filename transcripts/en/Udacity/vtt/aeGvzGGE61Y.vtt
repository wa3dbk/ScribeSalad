00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.050
Now Sunshine is dependent on the open
weather map service for its weather

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.029
data, and we don't have control over
how we communicate with their servers.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.020
And I already said that I wasn't going
to teach you about servers today.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.720
But I will teach you about GCM,
and to do that,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm going to fake a few
severe weather alerts.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.540
In the United States, the National
Weather Service issues severe weather

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.070
alerts when a hurricane, tornado,
tropical storm, blizzard or

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.050
a similarly severe weather
pattern is likely in an area.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.350
This weather does not happen
daily in most places.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.150
I'm looking at you, tornado alley.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.270
But when it does happen, it's vital
that your users be aware of the danger.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.980
And that means that these would
be time-sensitive alerts and

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.230
not nice-to-know facts tomorrow morning.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.180
So let's dive in.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.860
So normally we would have a shiny server
that subscribes to weather alerts.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.070
So then when a new alert happens,
the server will see it first.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.150
Then it can take that alert and
use it to make a push notification.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.225
And then it can send that
notification to each affected device.

00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:03.785
In this case, devices that are in the
region that we're concerned about for

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:04.495
the weather alert.

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:06.235
But, of course,

00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:09.755
before we begin you need to take
a trip to the Google API console.
