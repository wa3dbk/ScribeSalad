00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.340
Now let's review treatments from the Biological Approach. First, we have drug

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.959
therapy. Remember that with the development of the Neuroleptics or

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:12.370
Antipsychotics, we found effective treatments for people with Schizophrenia.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.289
Recall that the drugs were the Phenothiazines, including Chlorpromazine. And

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.711
that Chlorpromazine reduced the positive symptoms associated with

00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:26.426
Schizophrenia. Such as the delusions, and the hallucinations. We call also that

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:30.723
we have three classes of drugs that have been used to treat depression. And

00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:36.231
those are the MAO Inhibitors, the tricylics, and the SSRIs, Selective Serotonin

00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:41.980
Reuptake Inhibitors. These have all been proven to be effective in the

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.742
treatment of depression, And we also discussed that the SSRIs are used to treat

00:00:45.742 --> 00:00:51.751
anxiety as well. We also mentioned briefly that the tricyclics are sometimes

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:56.437
used for treating chronic pain, and for bedwetting, and also for the treatment

00:00:56.437 --> 00:01:01.974
of ADHD. In addition, we discussed the use of both the benzodiazepines, and the

00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:06.596
barbiturates, in the treatment of anxiety. But that the benzodiazepines are

00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:11.568
preferred over the barbiturates, because they are safer. We also discussed the

00:01:11.568 --> 00:01:15.040
long term negative consequences of using the benzodiazapines as they are

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.485
cognitive inhibitors. Also, you read about Lithium and that it's been

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:23.205
prescribed for a long time, because of it's ability to stabilize the mania

00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:28.724
associated with Bipolar Disorder. And we also have the stimulants. The

00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:33.376
stimulants help improve a person's ability to concentrate. And recall that,

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:37.765
also, from the biological approach are the pyschosurgeries that we discussed.

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:41.919
Briefly, you'll recall that we talked about the Prefrontal Lobotomy and that it

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:47.790
produce tragic effects and is no longer in use today. So this material here is

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.300
for a historical perspective, to see how far we've actually come in the area of

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.295
psychology. So lobotomy, remember, is not used today. We also discussed

00:01:57.295 --> 00:02:02.398
Electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, and it's used in the treatment of major

00:02:02.398 --> 00:02:08.505
depressive disorder. Recall here that an electric current is passed through the

00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:12.971
persons brain in order to induce a seizure. And afterwards, people report an

00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:18.239
absence of their depression symptoms. And finally we discussed Repetitive

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.760
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, also for the treatment of depression. So

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.050
together, for the biological approach, we had our drug therapies as well as our

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.150
psychosurgeries.
