00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.027
Since we know how much money we're starting with the beginning of year 2. We

00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:08.597
need to figure out the interest that amount is going to earn. Since your

00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:15.496
interest rate is 3%, we need to multiply 10,300 by 0.03. Since this is how we

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:25.580
convert three percent into a decimal. 10,300 times 0.03 is just 309. And this

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:33.216
added to our original balance gives grant 10,609 at the end of year 2. We know

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:37.888
that this is the amount that he starts with at the beginning of year 3. So we

00:00:37.888 --> 00:00:47.868
can write that in here as well. Now, 10,609 times 0.03 gives us $318.27. Adding

00:00:47.868 --> 00:00:58.874
these together, Grant has a total of $10,927.27, by the end of the third year.
