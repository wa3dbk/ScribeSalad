00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.977
When the word texture is used in the real world it is usually used to mean the

00:00:02.977 --> 00:00:07.202
feel of cloth or perhaps the roughness of a material. In computer graphics the

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:10.530
word texture refers to any pattern or image applied to a surface to change its

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.500
color, shininess or just about any other part of its appearance. In one sense

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.327
adding a texture to a surface is another form of modeling. You're specifying

00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:22.267
the color, roughness or reflectivity of the object based on its surface

00:00:22.267 --> 00:00:27.130
location. The most popular way to add a texture to a surface is to use images.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.920
Any 2D image can be applied to a surface. In these lessons, we'll delve into

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.592
how these images are attached to objects. And the various ways to control their

00:00:34.592 --> 00:00:38.090
display. Another important use for textures is to act as surrounding

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.620
environments. While it can be expensive to attempt to have objects reflect

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.322
other objects in a scene. It turns out to be extremely fast to reflect textures

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:49.889
representing a whole environment. There are some limiations, but surfaces can

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:54.010
be made to look much more realistic and visually rich by this simple addition.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.372
Even an approximation of refraction can be done with this type of technique. In

00:00:58.372 --> 00:01:01.270
this unit I'll provide you with the basics of how various forms of texturing

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.319
works. I'll also be taking you on a tour of some of the major effects

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.395
achievable with textures. I won't be explaining all of these in detail. The

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:12.660
good news is, the code for almost all the demos you'll see are part of 3JS.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.243
This gives you the ability to easily prod and poke at these various effects,

00:01:15.243 --> 00:01:19.774
and see what makes them tick. I strongly encourage you to do so. I did this

00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:24.182
myself in creating some of these lessons, and it was a lot of fun.
