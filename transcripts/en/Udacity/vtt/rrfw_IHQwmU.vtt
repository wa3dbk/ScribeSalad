00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The correct answer is that no persons are lost. Let's look into the reason for that.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
These are the creations of the SIR Model again.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If we form the sum of these three derivatives and see that this term minus coefficient times I times S

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
plus the same coefficient times I times S, cancelled in the sum

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and the same happens with this term, minus coefficient times I plus the same coefficient times I.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So the sum of these derivatives is zero. For simple interpretation of that left-hand side here.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If you look at this number, the number of susceptible persons

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
plus the number of infectious persons plus the number of recovered persons

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
form the derivative with respect to time, we get this expression.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The rate of change of the sum is the sum of the rates of change.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You see, in this case, I'm switching to the d/t notation

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because it's hard to place the dots on top of the sum.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So what we learned is, that the rate of change of the sum is zero.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If the rate of change is zero, there is no change and if there is no change,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the sum is constant which means nobody is lost.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Persons move from susceptible to infectious and from infectious to recovered

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
but never move out of that system.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We could see the same equation also if there was immigration, or births and deaths

00:01:27.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that compensate each other precisely.
