00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.990
In the previous exercise, the vertex shader was modified to change the surface

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.380
locations so that a part of a sphere was formed. However, the illumination

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.480
looks pretty bad. It doesn't look very curved. As we rotate around, there are

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.660
lighting computations going on. The shading changes but somethings not right.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.960
Why is the illumination incorrect? Is it that the vertex shader revserved the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.230
triangles loops? The fragment shader is now wrong and must be modified. The

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.590
vertex shader did not modify the shading normals or the geometric normals have

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.373
been warped by the vertex shader.
