00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.447
Try factoring these four terms. Notice that the first two terms are positive,

00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:08.909
but the second two terms are negative. This means that for these two terms, you

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:13.497
should have a negative greatest common factor. Try using our same approach, and

00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:17.933
just be careful with the negative sign. Factor this expression and write your

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:18.711
answer here.
