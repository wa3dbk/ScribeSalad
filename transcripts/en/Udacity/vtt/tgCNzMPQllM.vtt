00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.318
ESP stands for
Encapsulated Security Payload.

00:00:03.318 --> 00:00:06.630
ESP can encrypt and
authenticate packets.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.510
When ESP is applied,
the packet data portion, or

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.830
the payload, is encrypted for
confidentiality protection.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.290
In addition, message authentication is
applied to the encrypted payload and

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.187
the IPSec header.
