00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We'll get into both the mathematics and the practice

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
of implementing systems using cryptography,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but there's one thing I want to really emphasize,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and make sure that you understand.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Implementing your own cryptography is very challenging,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
it's something that is very easy to do incorrectly.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
One example of that to keep in mind--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and this is an important thing--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so we often think about programs as black boxes

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with inputs and outputs,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and our encryption functions will usually take a key in a message

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and produce some ciphertext,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and the implementations we'll show in this class

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
will be functionally correct,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
they'll produce the correct outputs.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
They won't be secure,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and the reason they won't be secure is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
things aren't really black boxes when we use them.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There's lots of other things that someone

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
could observe about this.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
They could observe how long it takes.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And when you can observe properties

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
of a function--other than their functional behavior--

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
other than just their inputs and outputs--

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that's called a side channel.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
An example of a side channel is timing.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So, the time it takes to run this function could vary,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
it could depend on the message or the key.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Most of the code that we're going to write in this class

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
will have that property.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We're not going to be adding complexity

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to our code to worry about things like side channels,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but in terms of implementing things correctly,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that's really important,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and there are lots of ways that code could have side channels.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It could affect what's in the cache of the processor,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and that could be visible in some way,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
it could actually affect how much power

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
your processor uses,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and people have shown ways to break smart cards

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
by measuring the power consumption as they do encryption

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and that gives you some insight into what the key is.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So, this is just an example of the kinds of things

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that it's very hard to get right in implementing cryptography.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
These are things that, if you were building cryptography

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
for any important use, you'd have to worry about.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
These are things that we are not going to worry about

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
in most of the code that we write in this class

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
so you shouldn't view these implementations as secure implementations.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The only reason to implement your own crypto

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
is for fun and learning.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And that's what we hope you'll get from this class by doing it,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but if you actually want to use cryptography

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
to protect anything important, well--

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
you should use a library implementation

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that's been carefully vetted,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that's been written in a way to worry about

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
these kinds of issues like timing side channels,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and that other people have looked at

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
carefully enough to have some higher level of confidence

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that it's correct and secure.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So I want to make sure everyone was paying careful attention

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to that last point,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and we'll have a quiz:

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Should you use any code from this course

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to protect nuclear launch codes?

00:02:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The answers are no--check the correct answer.
