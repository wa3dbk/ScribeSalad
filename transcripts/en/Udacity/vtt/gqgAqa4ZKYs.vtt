00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.920
In this lesson you're going
to learn how to add and

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.640
work with user interface
elements in iOS.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.600
You're going to build the first part of
the Pitch Perfect app with the ability

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.940
to add buttons and connect those
buttons to code in your app.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.970
We're going to be working with two
parts of the NVC diagram, the view and

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.170
the controller.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.740
Our controller is called the view
controller and the view, for

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.800
now, is just called the view.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.710
We won't see the code behind
a view classes just yet,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.520
as we're going to be using the view
classes that Apple provides,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.910
namely UIView, UILabel, and UIButton.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.930
We call that the controller
part of the NVC parent,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.350
is where we handle events from the view.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.400
And we're going to be using
the view controller that Xcode has

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.290
already started for us,
the ViewController.swift class.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.740
This is where the code, which will be
called by the buttons, will reside.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.730
At the moment our view controller
is just named view controller.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.950
But in a later lesson we'll name
it to something more meaningful

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.910
record view controller.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.990
User interfaces are one of the key ways
your users will interact with your app.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.590
Let's get started.
