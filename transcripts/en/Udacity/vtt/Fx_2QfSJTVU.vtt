00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
Now, I'll show you another function that is actually exponential time but also isn't that bad.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.000
What about 1.1^n?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.290
Absolutely not a polynomial time algorithm but still a huge speedup compared to 2^n.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.160
Let's do another quiz here--speedup of 1.1^n versus 2^n, and again,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.740
we're going to say that n=50 then you don't have to recalculate this here.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.970
You already know that it's about 10¹⁵ and I'll give you the same choices here.

00:00:29.970 --> 99:59:59.000
Is the speedup bigger than a million, bigger than a billion, or bigger than a trillion.
