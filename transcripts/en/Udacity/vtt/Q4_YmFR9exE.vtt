00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.710
&gt;&gt; Let us build on David's answers, let us suppose that the robot goes to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.870
the kitchen and finds this pail in the kitchen. It looks the pail and

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.160
decides that this pail meets this definition of a cup, denoted here by the solid

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.130
circle. The robot brings water to you in this pail. You look at the pail, and

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.750
you say to the robot, no robot, this is not a cup. At this point you would

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.810
expect a robot to learn from its failure. Cognitive agents do a lot of learing

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.990
from failures. Failures are opportunities for learning. We would expect robots,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.480
and intelligent agents more generally, to learn from their failures as well.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.540
How then may a robot learn form the failure of considering this fail as a cup.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.940
Note that the problem is not limited to this particular fail.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.480
We can take a different example connecting with this particular cup.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.290
Imagine that the definition of cup included a statement that it must have

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.350
a handle. In which case, the robot may not recognize that this is a cup.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.310
Later on you may teach the robot, this in fact is a good example for

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.580
cup, because it's liftable. In that case, the robot will want to understand from

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.210
that failure. It will want to understand why did it not consider it to be a cup?

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.190
It should have considered it to be a cup.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.200
So the problem is not just about successes that turned out to be failures. But

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.710
also about failures that should have been successes.
