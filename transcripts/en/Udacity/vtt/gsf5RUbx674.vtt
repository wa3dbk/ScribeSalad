00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.014
So the final step in the [UNKNOWN] algorithm is this write result step of

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:08.260
our broadcast, so let's see what happens during that step. So let's say that we

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.550
have this situation where we have already issued some instructions. This one has

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.310
been dispatched and is executing. And now is the cycle when this instruction is

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.700
done and wants to broadcast its results. So what's going to happen?

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.080
So the first thing that will happen is we put the tag, in this case RS1, and

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.300
the result, in this case minus 0.29, on the bus. So it gets broadcast to

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.270
all of these structures. So as a result of the broadcast, this will reach to all

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.440
of these units. Now what we want to do is write to the register file, basically.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.850
This is a new value for whichever register this supposed to be writing to, and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.601
we don't have to carry that this is going to register F2, because reservation

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:58.360
station one matches F2, so we know that the value is going to F2.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.140
So we're going to override the value in F2 with that. So, pretty much,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.920
the first step is to kind of over-ride the value in the register file. So

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.150
we have changed the F2 now because of this match between the RAT and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.020
the RS1, we know that F2 should be written with this value.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.820
The next thing that happens is we update the register allocation table.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.200
Basically the entry that matches our tag needs to be changed so

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.270
that it now points to the register file. We said that an empty RAT entry will be

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.310
indicative of just going to the registry instead of waiting for something, so

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.510
now we need to basically, you know, tag this in a way that makes it empty.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.270
Usually there is a valid bit here that just says it's empty.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.070
And the last thing we need to do, is free the reservation station.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.840
That is the reservation station whose name matches is now marked as empty so

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.380
that it can accept our new instruction. In this case, we kind of just delete

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.820
stuff from it, but in real harbor, there will be a valid bit here that says that

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.380
this is an empty reservation station. So, this is what needs to happen.
