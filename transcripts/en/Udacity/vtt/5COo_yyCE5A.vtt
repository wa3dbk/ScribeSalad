00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's do some simple tests.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We want to be able to get things like 1, 2, 3, 4

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and also 12-34.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's try the first one.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
1, 2, 3, 4, we win.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Oh, no problem there.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
How about this one, 12-34?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well, 1, 2--I can't take the hyphen here.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But I could take this epsilon transition for free and then take the hyphen.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That sounds good.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now I'm in state 4, and I see a 3.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So probably there should be some sort of digit label on this edge.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
3, 4, and then back here, and I accept.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Just to check our work, let's do something a little more complicated.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
1, 2, 3, hyphen, 3, 4.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Free, free again,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
hyphen, 5, 6, free again, accepted.

00:00:59.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Excellent.
