00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.830
Let's talk about the System UI
elements of Android Wear.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.170
When we talk about System UI elements,
we talk about cards and

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.090
indicators that give the user
the status of the wearable and

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.850
show notifications from
services on the user's phone.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.350
Your job as a designer is to keep these
elements from obscuring your design

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.160
by placing them carefully.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.350
Cards here are the notification system
that bridges information between

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.290
the wearable and a mobile device.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.470
Cards are also how most applications
communicate with users.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.660
The user will be notified on the
wearable about items such as emails and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.720
messages.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.780
We also have this concept of
something called a Peek card.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.200
The Peek card is the top card in
the stream that's partially visible

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.880
over the bottom of the watch face.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.600
The API provides the ability to detect
the dimensions of the peek card,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.270
like this red square here.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.800
So that your design can
react to this if necessary.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.570
You have the ability to request that
peek cards by default are hidden, small,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.640
or variable to expand to the contents.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.020
The user also has the ability to force
show or hide a peek card as well.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.380
But you need to design for
all possibilities.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.210
If you have a watch face with
the time shown right at the top,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.300
you can allow a variable peek card
that expands to the full height.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.900
This gives the most notification
information to the user when needed.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.830
If on the otherhand you have the time
at a relatively low position,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.440
you should leave ridge
a small peek card instead.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.590
If you have a round
face with analog hands,

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.410
you probably should use
a small peek card as well.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.671
However, the system notifies your
watch face when the bounds of a peek

00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:25.270
card change like here.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.520
So that you can rearrange the elements
of your design, if necessary.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.550
Like in this example here where the
clock face has actually resized itself.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.590
Indicators tell the user the status
of the wearable, such as charging,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.640
airplane mode,
connectivity, and so forth.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.360
And the hot word is the phrase,
OK Google, which tells

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.570
the user that they can interact with
the watch using voice commands.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.670
When a user activates the wearable, the
hot word can appear on the screen for

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.790
a few seconds.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.840
The indicator in the hot word can be
placed in several fixed locations

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.860
on the wearable.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.630
If you have a large peek card they
should go at the top of the screen.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.530
When you position these the the bottom,
the system forces a small peek card.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.300
If the edge of the watch face contains
strong visual elements such as ticks or

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.440
numbers like this one here.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.960
Then you should place the indicators
at the center of the screen.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.880
Finally, the indicators in hot word are
drawn in the text with no background.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.480
So if you have a watch face with complex
details in the background like text,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.130
you'll need to draw a field background
like these behind the text,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.050
in an appropriate color.
