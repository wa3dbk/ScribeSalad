00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.119
Right now, when we have the equation y equals x squared minus 3. The part of the

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:08.215
equation showing the shift in the graph, compared to y equals x squared, is on

00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:12.195
the right hand side of the equation, next to the x term. But what if I wanted

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:16.325
the shift to be shown on the left side of the equation, where the y is. After

00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:20.632
all, that's the direction we're moving things in, the vertical one. So what I'd

00:00:20.632 --> 00:00:24.724
like you to is rewrite this equation so the constant term is on the left hand

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:27.661
side, next to the y, instead of on the right hand side.
