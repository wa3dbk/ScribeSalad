00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.560
Here's how I found the answers.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.450
To evaluate A at these
fourth roots of unity,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.620
I first evaluated this polynomial
Ae at the second roots of unity.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.900
Note that Ae here is 1 plus x.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.560
Thus Aee, the even of those terms,
is just 1.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.970
And Aoe is the odd of those terms,
the coefficient here is 1 as well.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.770
So I can just write 1 and
1 in those slots.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.670
Applying these formulas then
tells me that Ae of 1 is 2 and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.678
Ae of negative 1 is 0.

00:00:39.678 --> 00:00:47.680
With this done, now I'm ready to find
the values of Ao at its roots of unity.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.240
Ao consists of the odd coefficients
here, so it's 0 minus x,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.952
and the even of these is the 0 and
the odd of those is negative 1.

00:00:59.952 --> 00:01:03.870
So I go ahead and
write those in those slots.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.340
Applying these formulas then tells
me that Ao of one is negative 1 and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.120
Ao of negative 1 is 1.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.550
With all these values computed
we can now apply the rules for

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.070
our final layer to obtain the answer
which I calculated to be this.
