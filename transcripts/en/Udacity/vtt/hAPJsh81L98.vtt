00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:11.057
Here, the range is 78,600 minus 21,180 which is 57,420. Here, the range is

00:00:11.057 --> 00:00:18.779
116,020 minus 7,350, which is a lot more than the other distribution. So this is

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.842
one way of measuring how spread out a distribution is. The range is easy to

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:29.269
compute and understand, and provides a quick familiar picture of how spread out

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.524
your data is. However, as we've seen before, convenience comes out of price.
