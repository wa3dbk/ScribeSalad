00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer I was looking for is

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
shard the database.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You wouldn't replicate the database

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because if it won't fit on one machine, it's probably not going to fit

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
on the next machine, and it still doesn't solve the machine we're talking about.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Get a bigger hard disk--well, that is technically true,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but if you put this,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you did not get the correct answer.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Shard the database--that's what we just talked about.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That allows you to take your data and spread it across

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
multiple machines, where each machine is storing just a piece of the data.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Take your data and spread it across multiple machines.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's what sharding a database is.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Or you could store less data.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You can delete some data from your database and of course it will fit,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
or you can use Mongo and it will do it for you.
