00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is what the HTML code of bugzilla.mozilla.org looks like.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It actually is almost 900 line of HTML,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so you feed this into the Mozilla browser, select print, and it crashes. But why?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In the early days of Mozilla, problem reports such as this one and failures such as this one

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
came in quicker than Mozilla programmers could possibly simplify them or even look at them.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But then the Mozilla product managers had a clever idea.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
They started the Mozilla Bugathon,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which meant that volunteers would go and simplify test cases.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This was a very simply process.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What you needed is a text editor such as this one,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and then you would go and remove parts of the HTML page,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
say this, for instance, run this through Mozilla,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and see whether the failure still persists.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And again, remove some part of the input and see whether the failure still persists,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
again and again and again,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and you repeat this until you have a page left, a small page, in which everything

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is relevant for reproducing the failure.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If you do this and keep on removing one part after the other,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
then all of a sudden you end up in a situation where the failure no longer occurs.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
After you remove some part the failure no longer occurs, what do you do next:

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
do you put the part you just removed back in

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and try to remove other parts,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.159
or do you keep only the part that you just removed and remove everything else,

00:01:26.162 --> 00:01:30.883
or you keep on removing until the failure occurs again? Over to you.
