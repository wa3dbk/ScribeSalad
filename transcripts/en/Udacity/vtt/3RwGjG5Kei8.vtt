Here in this first picture I have 2 out of 2 parts. Notice that its really one

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:10.882
whole circle. I have 1 half and 2 halves. Here I have 1 3rd of the circle, 2 3rd

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:16.662
of the circle and altogether will be 3 3rds of the circle. Here I have 1 4th, 2

00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:22.508
4th, 3 4th, and 4 4th. The same is true with the 5ths and 6ths. You can just

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.667
count up the pieces. So, the numerator counts how many pieces we have. The

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:35.252
denominator counts the types of pieces we have. So, for example, with 6, I have

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:41.180
1 6th, 2 6th, 3 6th, 4 6th, 5 6ths, and 6 6ths, or one whole. I know all these

00:00:41.192 --> 00:00:47.300
circles really represent one. They're all equal. They represent one whole

00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:47.895
circle.
