00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.556
The greatest common factor of variable expressions works just the same as it

00:00:04.556 --> 00:00:09.125
does with numbers. The greatest common factor or GCF is simply the product of

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:13.882
the lowest power of each number factor and variable factor that appears in every

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:18.619
term. So what do you think would be the greatest common factor for 45 x squared

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.047
y cubed and 36 x to the fourth y squared z?
