00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.022
The for loop is really useful to take words apart into the individual

00:00:03.022 --> 00:00:07.110
characters. For example, when we have a word like this, we might want to look

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.800
at one character at a time. And what we're going to do in our sample program,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.700
is count how many vowels this word has. Now, why does anyone care how many

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.738
vowels a word has? When you know how many vowels there are that gives you an

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:26.148
issue, an idea of how complicated the word is. And sometimes you actually have

00:00:26.148 --> 00:00:31.210
to adjust your writing to be simpler. And then it's good to know that so just.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.860
So, how do we do such a a thing. We need to, find, out, each of the characters.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.888
And then, look at it more closely. Over here, you see how to look at the i'th

00:00:41.888 --> 00:00:47.677
character. You take the substring, that goes from position i. Up to, but not

00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:52.579
including position i plus 1. And that is a string containing a single

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:00.660
character. And we'll let I vary from 0 to the last valid index. That would be

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.590
the length minus 1. Notice that I starts at 0. It is less than the length that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.622
makes means it goes up to the length minus 1 and it gets incremented by 1 every

00:01:10.622 --> 00:01:16.366
time. This loop that you see here with this fore header and extracting the i-th

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:20.270
letter that's what you use every time that you want to break a word into its

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.420
individual characters. Now, onto our specific problem we want to count vowels.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.000
The condition that you see here checks whether the letter is a vowel. it looks

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.198
a little backwards. We list all of the vowels, and we ask whether the letter

00:01:37.198 --> 00:01:42.875
is any one of those. If we have a vowel. We increment a counter. The rest of

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:46.940
the program is simple. We print the result and also we need to declare a few

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.646
variables. Let's run the program. We're supposed to type in a word and we learn

00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:57.092
that mouse has three vowels which doesn't surprise us. Actually is the bonus

00:01:57.092 --> 00:02:02.505
fact of the day. Some words have more vowels than you think. Here's the French

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:06.895
word for bird, oiseau, and it has five vowels out of six letters. Which is hard

00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:08.280
to imitate in English.
