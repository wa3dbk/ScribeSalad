00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.798
Here are 2 materials, that as you rotate them, it doesn't really change how

00:00:02.798 --> 00:00:07.084
they reflect the light. Here's a material where it does. As you rotate it, the

00:00:07.084 --> 00:00:10.590
light reflects in different ways. The second kind of material is called

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.192
anisotropic. Compared to isotropic, which is how most materials are. Good

00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:20.091
examples of anisotropic materials are. Brushed aluminum and velvet. A simple

00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:23.507
wave making a material anisotropic is to give the object a pair of normals

00:00:23.507 --> 00:00:27.826
instead of a single normal. In this exercise you start off with our energy

00:00:27.826 --> 00:00:31.406
balance to blend on reflection model for a plane. What I want you to do is

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:34.320
change the single normal to be two normals as if the material has grooves in

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.010
it. If you look closely at the fragment shader, you'll see I cheat a bit. I

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.060
take the fragment's location and use its x and z position to make these new

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.982
normals. I can do this because I know the original normal is mostly pointing up

00:00:45.982 --> 00:00:49.968
the y axis. Your job is to take these two normals and use them instead of the

00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:53.786
original normal. Basically you need to apply the reflection model twice, once

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:57.709
to each normal. To keep things about the same intensity, make both of these

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:02.564
contributions be each just half as strong. I'd like to point out that GLSL has

00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:07.140
the idea of a loop built into it. This should prove handy for this exercise.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.868
Here's the result which, even though it's a hack, looks pretty nice I don't

00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:14.220
mind saying. Remember, the major rule of graphics is it just has to look right.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.356
One thing to keep in mind, the groove parameter, when set to zero, should give

00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:21.529
a result exactly the same as the original reflection model. If it doesn't

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:23.579
you'll need to figure out what to fix.
