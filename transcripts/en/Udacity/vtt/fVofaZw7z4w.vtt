00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.260
As entrepreneurs are trying to build
our their e-commerce business,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.970
it's really important to
understand the impact

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.960
mobile devices had on
commerce in general.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.540
For a long time,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.700
it was thought that purchasing
on a mobile phone can't happen.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.025
You have to type in all
this extra information.

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:27.660
But more and
more it's becoming really obvious

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.240
that that's where people
are spending all of their time.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.408
So in the same way people were shopping
online on their PC's a long time ago,

00:00:36.408 --> 00:00:39.430
now a lot of that commerce
happens on the phone.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.400
So, it's really important to really
think about how do you optimize your

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.780
experience, and your purchase experience
specifically, for the mobile device.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.370
And so things like thinking
about how can you auto fill

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.260
information based off of what's
already in your phone built in there?

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.950
And thinking about,
as you're actually have different

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.520
interactions with your website.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.460
Think about how much space do I actually
have on this screen to actually

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.460
fit in all the different buttons.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.876
Like if you want to offer reviews,

00:01:19.876 --> 00:01:25.977
like the ability to choose color,
ability to choose size.

00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:29.855
Like ability to sort of switch
between a lot of different images of

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:31.390
the same product.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.380
One of the things that you realize
is that you have to make trade offs.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.700
And the only way you
can really understand

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.760
how to make those trade-offs
is through testing.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.740
And really figuring out,
if I have this button here, which takes

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.620
up the full screen, or opposed to having
two different buttons on that screen.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.440
How does that impact
the conversion rate?

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.740
Because of the focus more and
more on the mobile device.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.979
Testing becomes more and more important
because you don't have all that much

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.641
real estate to actually work with.
