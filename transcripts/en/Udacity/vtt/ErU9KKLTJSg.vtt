00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.830
In Swift, structs are much more
powerful than in other languages.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.110
Their capabilities
approach those of classes.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.600
In addition to their own properties,
they can also have their own methods,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.130
and can expand functionality
through extensions and protocols.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.380
Let's take a look at
a couple of examples.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.310
Here's a struct called picture frame.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.000
It has three stored properties.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.670
Width, height and thickness, and
one computed property, area.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.087
As with enumerations structs can
have customized emit methods.

00:00:27.087 --> 00:00:31.018
But they also come with automatically
generated member wise initializers,

00:00:31.018 --> 00:00:32.820
like this one here.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.930
In this line of code,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.830
I'm initializing a ten by eight
picture frame with a thickness of 1.5.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.358
And this is how I access
the computed property, area, and

00:00:41.358 --> 00:00:45.370
up here you can see the area
properties custom getter.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.230
Here's another example, this beer struct
has three stored properties, style,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.210
percent alcohol, and
an international cheers dictionary.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.970
Cheers dict is a type property,
it also has a computed property,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.780
suggested volume per serving.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.170
The volume per serving goes down,
as the alcohol percentage goes up.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.180
Some of the Belgian beers at the pub
around the corner from my house

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.650
are super strong.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.890
If I was drinking whole pints of those,
I might be in trouble.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.220
The beer struct also has its
own type method called Cheers.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.030
It takes in a language and prints out
a phrase to toast with in that language.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.230
And this is what initialization
looks like for the beer struct.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.160
Again, I'm using the automatically
generated member y's initializer

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.340
to set our style and
percentAlcohol properties.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.340
And here in the sidebar,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.360
you can see that a lager with 6%
alcohol has been instantiated.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.770
As usual,
we can access the computed property,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.860
suggestedVolumePerServing with
dot syntax.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.030
Now I want to open up the console for
a second, so we can see our results.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.010
Remember that because
Cheers is a type method,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.270
we call it on the struct itself,
so we call it on beer.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.830
And then, let's pick a language
we want to toast in,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.540
let's toast in Japanese.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.700
And then we can look over in
our console and see kompai.
