00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:08.739
horizontal lines in the last quiz. Try to use that information to figure out

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:13.441
what equation describes all the points along line a, and what equation describes

00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:17.962
all the points along line b. This is definitely tricky, so if you have trouble

00:00:17.974 --> 00:00:19.417
with it, no big deal at all.
