00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.200
Let's add a new style sheet and

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.370
a media query that applies only when
the view port is wider than 500 pixels.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.920
I'll add a new linked CSS file with a
media attribute, and I'll set the value

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.770
to screen and min-width 500 pixels so

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.730
that it's only applied when
the screen is over 500 pixels.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.510
You may see references to other
media types, but ignore them.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.990
Media types like handheld, projected, or

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.690
embossed never really gained any
traction and don't do anything.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.290
Just stick with screen and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.850
print if you think your users
are going to want to print your page.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.520
I'll take a look at the style
sheet that gets applied and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.840
see that it changes
the background color to blue.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.600
All right.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.680
I'll reload the page in the browser.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.810
Notice that the background remains
white, but as I start to resize it,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.610
once it hits that 500 pixel break point,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.610
the screen turns blue because
the media query's been matched.
