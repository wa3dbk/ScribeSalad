Now that we've learned from users, we're going to iterate our designs, and

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.680
then we'll commit to them. And we're going to wrap them up in

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.780
a presentation. Before we do that, let's go check in with the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.510
students at Udacity office, and hear what they've learned from this project.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.290
&gt;&gt; I wanted to feel good when I use this

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.800
up. So say someone came on or within your range. But

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.020
what if you see a flower or a fun picture that

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.510
you like. Hmm; Hmmm. It adds a click, but it makes

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.390
me feel good and I'm happy to compensate for a click,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.710
as far as it makes me feel good. So you click

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.580
on that and then it shows you the map and shows

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.990
you the person that you're most likely to barter with or

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.680
exchange or transact with, and gives a little profile of who

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.490
they are and What they're wanting to offer. Once you dig

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.440
deeper there's a screen that tells you how many hours you

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.680
have. So these were just supposed to be coins that you

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.350
have 16 hours right now and for this transaction you need three

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.010
hours. There's a little button that can help you transact, and once you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.240
have transacted makes you feel better by showing you an ice cream

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.950
cone or a heart sign, or some image that makes you feel nice.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.920
&gt;&gt; I like the fact that you're putting a focus on that one person.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.030
So if that's like a mutual thing, like if you got shown Clifton's profile, and

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.840
then Clifton gets showed Kanall's profile, you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.090
establish that mutual connection. It's much more kind

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.220
of deep and meaningful than just seeing like

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.060
a list right? And you pick from list.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah because it seemed to me as if the, the soul of the business.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.010
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.000
&gt;&gt; Was about exchanging hours and not

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.190
money. And that was, it was already fun.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.970
&gt;&gt; I like the flower idea, I would've taken that from you,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.240
if you don't already have it on camera, the thought of it.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.980
&gt;&gt; You should take it.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.770
&gt;&gt; It's okay.
