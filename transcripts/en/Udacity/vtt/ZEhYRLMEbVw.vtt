00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.900
Now let's discuss the next phase of software development,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.080
which is software design. Software design is the phase

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.030
where software requirements are analyzed in order to produce

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.500
a description of the internal structure and organization of

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.900
the system. And this description will serve as the

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.550
basis for the construction of the actual system. Traditionally,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.020
the software design phase consists of a series of

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.360
design activities. Which normally consists of the architectural design phase,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.880
the abstract specification, interface design,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.010
component design, data structure and

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.230
algorithm design. And notice that this is just a possible list

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.820
of activities. But you can also characterize design activities in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.550
many different ways. And if you're looking at different books, and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.800
different sources, you might find different activities described. But the

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.500
core idea, the important point is that we go from sort

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.940
of a high-level view of the system, which is the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.770
architectural design, to a low-level view, which is the algorithm design.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.100
And these activities result in a set of design

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.810
products, which describe various characteristics of the system. For

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.770
example, they describe the architecture of the system, so

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.890
how the system is decomposed and organized into components, the

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.630
interfaces between these components. They also describe these components

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.030
into a level of details that is suitable for

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.470
allowing their construction. We will discuss the details of

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.130
software design and talk extensively about these different actives and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.200
these different products in the third mini course of this class.
