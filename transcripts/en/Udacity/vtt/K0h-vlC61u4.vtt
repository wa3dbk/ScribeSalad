00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.117
The answer is that all of these curves over here are functions, except for curve

00:00:04.117 --> 00:00:08.175
D. That's this light blue one right here. And we can see, that right here

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:13.321
between 0 and looks like about 4, if we put a vertical line in that region the

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:18.226
curve that intersect that line at more than one point. That means there are

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:22.646
certain inputs, or certain x values, on this curve for which there is more than

00:00:22.646 --> 00:00:26.376
one y value, so this is not a function. All the other ones are however,

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:30.336
including another graph unlike anything you've seen, this graph E right here,

00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:33.342
this is just proof that there is always more to learn in math.
