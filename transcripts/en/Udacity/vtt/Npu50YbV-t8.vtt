00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now we're in pretty good shape, but there's one more thing that bothered me

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in the initial specification,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and that was we said that if there's a tie, don't worry about it,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
or we claim that there won't be any ties, but there could be.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I would hate to have this program tell me I lost

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
when I actually tied.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I wouldn't mind it telling me I won when I actually tied,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but I don't want it to tell me that I lost.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What if I finally got a straight flush, ace high,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
only to find that another player had exactly the same hand

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but in a different suit?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Well, if that happened in the Old West, you might expect some shots to be fired,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but assuming there was no cheating going on,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the 2 winners should split the pot equally.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
That's the way the rules of poker work.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And the way our program would work is

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
it would arbitrarily choose one of the maximums out of the 2 that tied.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That doesn't seem fair, so to accommodate that idea,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
what do you think we can do?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
How are we going to handle ties?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We could change the function hand_rank.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We could change the function poker,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
or we could add a new function.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And check which ones you think would work okay

00:01:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and which single one do you think would be best?
