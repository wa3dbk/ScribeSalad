00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.670
For digital health data
to help coordinate care,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.109
in our highly specialized and
fragmented system, it must be shared.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.800
To support population health management,
public health, and

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.230
research, it must be aggregated for
analysis.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.570
Whenever it is moving, there
are inevitable concerns about respecting

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.423
the patient's privacy preferences,
securing it from unauthorized

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:31.200
disclosure, and knowing that
the persons or entities who send it and

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.070
with whom it is being shared,
are who they claimed to be.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.210
In this lesson, we've gained a basic
understanding of the technologies and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.210
policies required to achieve all
three of these important objectives.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.030
We've not yet dealt with a question
that is increasingly being asked.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.660
Have we gone too far with this?

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.390
Are the complexities we've created
in the interest of privacy security,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.380
and trust now standing in the way
of other important objectives?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.930
For that we talk with Don Detmer,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.390
one of the best known people in
health informatics, and a member of

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.800
the committee that wrote the landmark
IOM report, we discussed in lesson one.
