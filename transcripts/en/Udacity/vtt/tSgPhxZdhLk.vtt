00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.870
Let's talk about database performance. Database performance in MongoDB is

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.240
driven by pretty much the same thing that every database is

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.780
driven by, which is are you going to use an

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.020
index to resolve your query or not? So this maybe a

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.500
review for a lot of you, but I want to take

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.690
you through the basics of indexing, and what it is and

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.630
why it's so effective. If you look at MongoDB or any

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.350
other database, it will store its data in these large files

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.710
on disk. There's no particular order for the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.310
documents on the disk. They can be anywhere in

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.490
a database file. If you want to pull out

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.470
a particular document, you do a query. Now, what

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.540
the database is going to have to do

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.750
by default is scan through the entire collection to

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.540
find the data. This is called a table scan

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.230
in relational databases and a collection scan in MongoDB.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.120
It is death to your performance. If the data

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.490
set is large, it'll be extremely slow. So, instead what

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.580
we do is we create an index, or maybe

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.760
more than one index. So how does indexing work? Well,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.390
it's actually pretty straightforward. If something is ordered, like

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.080
for instance, this list of hashtags, even if it's very

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.790
long, it's very quick to find something in the

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.050
list because we can use binary search to do it.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.570
So, finding something in a sorted list is really

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.510
quick. Now to create an index, we want to specify

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.080
a key. An index is simply an ordered list

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.740
of keys. Now we don't actually keep them linearly

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.500
ordered like this in MongoDB, we use something called

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.710
a B Tree, but conceptually you can imagine it

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.540
looking like this perfectly reasonable conceptual model. And if

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.070
I'm looking for like say Lucero, I can quickly search,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.960
find the item and then have a pointer

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.570
to the actual document or documents inside the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.380
collection that have this hashtag associated with them.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.810
So this picture actually represents an index that is

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.130
composed of just hashtags. So we're using a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.800
single field as the basis for our index. But

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.840
this is just a special case of the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.700
more general idea of indexes in MongoDB. In mongoDB,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.699
indexes are ordered lists of keys. You can have just

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.210
one, as we saw in the previous example, or we

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.210
could do something like this and construct an index out

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.120
of three keys. Let's say for example the hashtag, the date

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.600
on which a tweet was created, and the username of

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.350
the person creating the tweet. The order is important here. Because,

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.585
conceptually, the way the index is built, is that the

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:31.110
hashtag will be at the top, so here are my hashtags:

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.110
Colin Hay, Lucero and then Steve Earle near

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.830
the end of my index. And then, within

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.180
this, so let's say Colin Hay is conceptually

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.820
here, for all of those items, we'll have dates

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.400
as the second level of our index. And

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.010
what we're going to do within the Colin Hay portion

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.680
of the index is sort these by order

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.560
of date. So the documents then, that are identified

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.110
down to this level of date are first identified by

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.400
the hashtag colinhay and then sorted based on their date of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.370
creation. And then finally, within each date, so for each

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.140
day on which a tweet was created with the hashtag colinhay,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.190
we're going to have the usernames of all of those

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.700
users and those then will be sorted as well. So if

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.020
you provide me just the hashtag I can go into the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.790
index and find all the let's say Luceros in this case.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.490
And if you prefer to also provide me the date,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.930
then I can break it down and find all the Lucero

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.610
tweets on that particular day. At the very bottom of this

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.140
of course, is going to be pointers to the actual data.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.140
Now, in order for MongoDB to be utilized in index

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.300
you have to give it a left most set of items.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.060
So, you can give it just the hashtag or you can

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.120
give it just the hashtag and the date or the hashtag,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.610
the date, and the user name. For this particular index, if you

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.130
provide me just the date, I can't do much really with the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.380
index because the date is down here at this level. So to

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.110
use an index, I need to start at the top, and this is

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.370
true whether or not I'm doing a query or I'm doing an

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.960
update or I'm doing a sort, because sorts also will use an

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.280
index to sort their values. So for instance, if I pull a

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.340
bunch of data out of the collection and want to sort it by

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.530
hashtag, with MongoDB, I can use this index to do

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.180
the sorting. Now, one other point I want to make is that

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.330
every time you want to insert something into the database

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.800
this index would need to be updated, and that updating is

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.340
going to take some time. So we use indexes to make

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.920
Reads faster, but Writes become a little bit slower if you

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.560
have an index because the index needs to be updated. So

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.680
you need to take that into consideration when you're thinking about

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.070
what indexes you might want for your particular

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.509
application. Indexes are not costless. They take space

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.248
on disks, they also take time to keep updated. So you don't want to have a index

00:04:47.248 --> 00:04:48.882
on every single possible way you're going to

00:04:48.882 --> 00:04:50.602
query the collection, you instead want to have

00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:52.021
an index on the ways you're most likely

00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:53.690
way you are going to query the collection.
