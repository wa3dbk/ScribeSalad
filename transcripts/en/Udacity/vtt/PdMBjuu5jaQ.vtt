00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.570
Okay, here's my solution. So, what I'm doing is, I'm

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.760
using a global variable, which is not a great habit to

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.390
get into. But, it works in this simple case, to store

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.460
the index into the list. Basically which server we're on. And

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.760
I started at negative 1, so that the first time I

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.520
incremented it, it increments to 0, so we'll be at position

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.390
0. I'm using the global keyword here, which basically tells Python

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.690
to, use the global n. The n defined outside this function,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.810
instead of making a new variable called n. If I didn't

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.870
have this global n, this line would raise an exception saying

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.770
n is not defined. And then what I do, is I

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.830
ref, I return the index into the list of servers the correct

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.644
position. So and what we do is, we say, n modulo

00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:44.180
length of SERVERS. So length of SERVERS is 4. And if you

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.120
don't know how the mod operator works, basically what it does

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.230
is, it says, give me the remainder of doing the division. So,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.820
what this means is, we take n divided by length SERVERS

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.760
and then we take the remainder of that. That's what modular does.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.670
So if its zero we say 4 goes into 0, 0 times.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.980
If n is 1 we say 4 goes into 0, or 4

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.289
goes into 1, 0 times with a remainder of 1. And

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.360
so, so we get an x 1. And so as n increments,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.005
you know, when n is 5 we say, you know, link servers

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:15.860
4 goes into 5, one time, with the remainder of one again.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.570
So the loop is over. So if we get this a whirl, it would print out

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.490
something like this. Okay, so if we go ahead and run this, we see our output

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.390
SERVER 1, 2, 3, 4, 1. so, simple

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.770
enough, that's our Round Robin little balancing works.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.740
Like I said, you probably want to have to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.980
implement this anytime soon. But, there you go.
