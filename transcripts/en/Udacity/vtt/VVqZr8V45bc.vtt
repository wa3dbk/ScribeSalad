00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.708
All we need to do to solve these two problems is plug the right numbers into

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:08.220
our equations up here. Let's start out with the quarterly compounding option.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:17.822
What do we know? Well, P equals 20,000, r equals 0.04, n equals 4 and t equals

00:00:17.822 --> 00:00:23.872
5. Great. Now, let's just plug these numbers in to solve for A, since that's

00:00:23.872 --> 00:00:30.432
what we're looking for. A will equal 20,000 times 1 plus 0.04 over 4, all of

00:00:30.432 --> 00:00:40.298
that raised to the 4 times 5 power. This simplifies to 20,000 times 1.01 to the

00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:48.430
20. If we plug this into a calculator and round, we end up with $24,403.80.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.125
Now, on to monthly compounding. We do almost exactly the same thing. In fact,

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:58.894
all of our information is the same, except that n is not 4. This time n is 12,

00:00:58.894 --> 00:01:05.691
since there are 12 months in 1 year. For A then, we have 20,000 times 1 plus

00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:14.377
0.04 over 12 raised to the 5 times 20 or 60 power. Plugging this into a

00:01:14.377 --> 00:01:21.380
calculator gives us $24,419.93. Although, these two total balances aren't too

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.860
far off from one another, Grant will end up with slightly more money if he goes

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.230
with the monthly compounding interest choice. And look at that, after 5 years

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.768
in either case, he'll earn over $4,400 just by keeping his money in his

00:01:35.768 --> 00:01:40.215
account. That's a pretty good deal.
