What we have seen so far are the basic features of Acme. That is the vocabulary

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.980
of keywords and descriptions that you can build from the keywords describing

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.620
basic architectures. However, Acme has some additional features that allow you

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.710
to go beyond this basic vocabulary. In particular, because Acme was

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.840
designed in support of interchanging architectural descriptions between tools.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.330
And each tool may have its own vocabulary that goes beyond what's needed for

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.320
simple interchange. Acme has a mechanism for embedding within it tool specific

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.980
terminology. This additional text is not interpreted by Acme other than for

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.230
syntax checking. But is passed along to the various tools. And they can do their

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.960
own work on it. This extension mechanism is called Acme's property sublanguage.
