00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.540
This is a really high value, meaning that the relationship between miles and

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:13.010
ticket price is very strong. R squared is about 0.83 which means that 83% of

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.620
the differences in cost is due to the differences in miles traveled. Now we

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.530
want to find the equation for our line of best fit. Remember that the generic

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:29.690
form is y equals bx plus a or a plus bx, doesn't matter. Where b is our slope

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.900
and a is our y intercept. You learned before that the slope is equal to

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.780
Pearson's R times the ratio of the standard deviations. We already found R. Our

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.300
next step is to find the standard deviation for the y values. And the standard

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.180
deviation for the X values. Remember that since these are the sample standard

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.640
deviations, we have to use the corrected standard deviation, dividing by n

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.897
minus 1.
