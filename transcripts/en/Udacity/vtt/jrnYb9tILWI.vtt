00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.689
So now that we have the app working on the simulator, it's time to put the app,

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.090
on the device.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.780
If you do not have a device, feel free to skip this step.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.080
Please note that you will need iOS 8 or a later version running on your phone.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.680
This is because our code uses some APIs, like AV Audio Engine,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.490
that are only available in iOS 8.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.490
In the instructor notes, there is a document that will guide you

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.490
through the entire process, of putting your app on the phone.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.050
If you have questions about this process, we are here to help.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.110
Ask those questions on the discussion forum.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.610
So I invite you to read through the document now,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.980
check this box when you are done.
