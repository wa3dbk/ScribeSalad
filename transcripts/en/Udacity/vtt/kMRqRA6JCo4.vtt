The answer is both.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.810
This is an example of the inconsistency
in the way clinical data is represented.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.980
It makes it difficult
to aggregate data and

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.690
communicate data among what we
refer to as non-interoperable EHRs.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.750
And as a result of that, it makes it
more challenging to coordinate care.
