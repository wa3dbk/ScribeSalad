00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now we have a way with regular expressions to choose

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
either a or b.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Another very common choice is to choose between

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
a or nothing

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That is, to have a part of a string that's optional.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For example, when you're writing out numbers, it's possible

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to put a negative sign at the begining of a number.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But you don't need to, depends on which number your trying to get across.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Here I've drawn a finite state machine that accepts numbers with no leading negative sign

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and numbers with leading negative sign.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
let's see how it goes.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
For something like 1,2,3, we start here. 1,2,3, and we're in state 4, which accepts.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
For something like -57--negative, 5, 7--we're in state 3, which accepts.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But you may have noticed quite a bit of duplication

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in this finite state machine.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
These two red areas are the same.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It's an edge labeled 0 - 9, an accepting state with a self-loop labeled 0 - 9.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And one of the things we really wanted was to be concise.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So conceptually, it might be simpler to have an edge that somehow consumes no input.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This new finite state machine will still accept 1, 2, 3.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Here we start in state 1. I don't consume anything and move to state 2.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And then it's 1, 2, 3, and we accept.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
-57, I take the negative, 5, 7, and then we accept.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We have a particular convention for indicating that an edge accepts no input.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We use the Greek letter Epsilon.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You can either think of Epsilon as meaning "consume no input"

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
when you go across this edge, or you can think of it as referring to "the empty string",

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
at which point you can consume the empty string all you want,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
but since it's of size 0, it doesn't effect what you're trying to recognize.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This idea of using this Greek letter--this is totally arbitrary.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This is just an artificial convention.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But it's a commonly used one, so it's worth knowing.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Continuing our theme that anything that can be done in finite state machines

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
can be done in regular expressions and vice versa--we'll firm that up later on.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm going to give you a new regular expression--the question mark,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
which we typically read as optional or the previous thing 0 or 1 times.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
In that way, it's a lot like plus, which was the previous thing 1 or more times.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So I might write a regular expression that accepts numbers that may optionally

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
have a leading negative sign.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This negative sign may be present 1 time or 0 times.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It can be there or not.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We definitely need the [0 - 9]+.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And the string we're looking for this needle in is "1861-1941 R. Tagore".

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And on this particular input, we will find 2 substrings that match.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
1861 matches without the leading negative sign,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and -1941 matches with the leading negative sign.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Rabindranath Tagore is a Nobel Prize winning Bengali poet,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.092
perhaps best known for his work, Where the Mind is Without Fear.
