00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.030
In the previous lessons we worked with polynomial expressions. The variables had

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.730
non negative integer exponents. And our expressions could contain any number of

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.035
terms. We learned how to add, subtract, multiply and even divide these

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:16.841
polynomials. In the upcoming lessons, we'll make use of our new factoring and

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:21.985
look at performing these same operations for rational expressions. A rational

00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:26.381
expression is a ratio of two polynomials. It is a fraction in which the

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:31.386
numerator and the denominator are both polynomials, 1 over x is an example of a

00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:37.170
rational expression, since 1 is a mynomial and x is also a mynomial. The second

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.720
example contains the polynomial x plus 2 in the numerator, and 3x minus 1 in the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.950
denominator. So this is also a rational expression. And this course will prepare

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.182
you to handle any sort of polynomial or rational expression. You'll be able to

00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:56.826
add, subtract, multiply and even divide these rational expressions by the end of

00:00:56.826 --> 00:00:57.574
this unit.
