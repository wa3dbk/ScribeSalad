I walked you through using
jQuery's on() method.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.010
And you spent some time researching
jQuery's convenience methods

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.050
that are just shortcuts for
the on() method.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.908
Surprisingly, there's still another
way to set up an event listener with

00:00:10.908 --> 00:00:12.490
jQuery's on() method.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.100
In the next section,
you'll learn about event delegation,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.880
where jQuery watches one parent element
for events on any of its children.
