00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.163
The answers are, from left to right, parallel, neither, perpendicular, and

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:10.123
perpendicular. We can see right off the bat that for the first pair of lines,

00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:15.208
they have the same slope, 3. In the second pair of lines, it might at first look

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.624
you have similar situation, but because of this coefficient of 7 in front of our

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:26.830
y term in the 2nd equation, we actually end up seeing that we have a slope of 3

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:33.479
over 7 when we divide both sides by 7. So these lines are not parallel, nor are

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:38.852
they perpendicular. For the third pair, negative 3 times 1/3 is negative 1. Or

00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:44.379
equivalently, 1/3 is equal to negative 1 over negative 3. Either way you look at

00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:48.962
it, these lines are perpendicular. And last but not least, to figure out the

00:00:48.974 --> 00:00:53.636
slope of this top of this equation, you need to divide both sides by two, which

00:00:53.648 --> 00:00:58.599
gives us a slope of 1/2. In the second equation you see a coefficient in from of

00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:05.999
the x term, of negative 2, and negative 1 over negative 2 is equal to 1/2. So

00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:09.256
these two lines are perpendicular.
