00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.300
TCP congestion control responds to interpreted network events like packet

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.200
loss, but does not provide a high-level control mechanism for

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.920
congestion. In this section, we'll look at traffic shaping and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.990
network measurement, which are important tools for operating the network.
