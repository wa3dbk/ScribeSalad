Focusing in on human evolution, we'll see that modern humans have been around

00:00:04.685 --> 00:00:10.612
for only about 200,000 years, but we're still going strong. Other human species

00:00:10.612 --> 00:00:14.776
have been alive for a lot longer, but they're now extinct. Homo

00:00:14.776 --> 00:00:20.471
neanderthalensis or neanderthals, lived from about 400,000 years ago to about

00:00:20.471 --> 00:00:27.179
28,000 years ago. Whereas Homo erectus lived from around 1.8 million years ago

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:33.734
to about 300,000 years ago. And Homo habilus lived somewhere around 2.4 to 2.5

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:40.386
million years ago until about 1.4 million years ago. Modern humans also share

00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:44.570
kinship with other living primates like modern chimpanzees.
