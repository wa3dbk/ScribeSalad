00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.555
Now for this example we're going to
look at a function called ColorFromHex.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.770
This function takes color represented
as an integer, specifically a UInt32 or

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.530
32 bit integer.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.893
Now we're going to use hexidecimal
notation, because it's easier to read.

00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:18.629
You may have seen colors represented
this way if you've worked in web

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:19.308
design before.

00:00:19.308 --> 00:00:25.090
When a color's represented with six
hex digits, like this pink color here,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.900
the first two hex digits represent
the red part of the color.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.670
So this cc represents
the red part of the color.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.980
The next two digit represent
the green part of the color.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.400
And the last two digits represent
the blue part of the color.

00:00:39.758 --> 00:00:44.650
So the ColorFromHex function is going to
use the bitwise &amp; operator to isolate

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.960
each of these component parts.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.390
It's going to isolate the red part,
the green part and the blue part.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.396
That's what's happening with each
of these bitwise &amp; operators here.

00:00:53.396 --> 00:00:56.924
Then, with the shift operator,
it converts the R, G, and

00:00:56.924 --> 00:01:00.400
B components into a number
that's between 0 and 255.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.360
Finally, it divides the RGB components
by 255 so that the number is

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.650
fixed between 0 and 1, because that's
how a UI color is constructed.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.910
If you had trouble following that,
then don't despair.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.580
I've included a fun link, here,
to a video that really captures how red,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.150
green, and blue values
are combined to create a color.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.139
And if you look down here at the bottom
where we've called the function,

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:28.290
we've actually split out pink into
its red, green, and blue components.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.920
And then we've printed out the colors
that combined to make this pink color.
