00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.360
But what if our sum, instead, was 11 x plus 22? What do you think our final

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.681
answer would be this time? Now, I know this wasn't the sum for our last problem,

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:13.557
but I want you to see if there's an extra step you need to do at the end.

00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:18.576
Sometimes you need to simplify further. Can you in this case? Write your answer

00:00:18.576 --> 00:00:19.038
here.
