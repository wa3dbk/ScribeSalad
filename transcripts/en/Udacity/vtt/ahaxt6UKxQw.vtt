00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.350
You learned about the bias–variance tradeoff in this lesson and

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.250
the last lesson. Now I want you to hear from Sean.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.870
Hear about his work at Facebook and pay careful attention to

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.240
his models and the trade offs in the visualizations he made.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.580
&gt;&gt; Some recent work I've been doing on measuring fan sentiment for

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.939
NFL teams over the course of the season that I'm really excited about.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.930
it's, it's been a really fun project because I myself am, am an

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.420
NF, NFL fan. I'm a huge Eagles fan and I go through all

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.790
of the, emotions that a fan goes through over the course of

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.090
the season. You know, the highs of when your team wins and then

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.600
the lows after a couple losses in a row of feeling kind of

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.660
hopeless. And so I got the idea of maybe we could measure this

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.490
and kind of tell a story. Not just for my team but

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.820
for all the other teams in the NFL, and come up with some

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.410
idea, some way of visualizing this, this experience of being a fan. And

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.950
so I, I counted ratios of positive to negative words at five-minute increments

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.020
over the course of the whole four months of the NFL season. And

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.520
because we're taking a ratio, we end up with some measurements that are

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.100
extremely high. Like, you know, positive to negative word ratios, oh, over a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.340
hundred even though the average in somewhere in the two to three range.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.390
So this, this was kind of like a first cut at the data, and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.220
we can see that there's some signal here. But it's, it's definitely going to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.510
need some, some modeling or some statistics in order to kind of tease

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.130
out what's actually happening. So what I did was just compute a moving average

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.360
of these five minute measurements and we start to get a little

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.630
bit of signal out of there. Because we're pooling over more measurements, so

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.670
the measurements themselves are more reliable. And we end up with a series

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.350
that kind of tells a little bit of a story. But these measurements

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.810
are still too frequent and too noisy to, to really tell a story

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.240
about what's happening. When we aggregate it up to one day moving averages,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.800
we start to see some patterns emerge. I guess one of the key

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.180
features of this dataset was that I knew what I was looking for

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.040
ahead of time. Because I, I am an Eagles

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.720
fan, I experienced the highs and lows of the seasons.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.070
I can look at a plot like this immediately

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.940
and tell you this is not telling the story that

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.500
I want. We needed to maybe apply some modeling

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.580
to that. We want a model that predicts sentiment as

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.248
a function of time. And one of the things

00:01:57.248 --> 00:02:00.050
that comes to mind right away is a natural spline.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.920
&gt;&gt; You can see that this actually tells a nice story. These color lines are

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.250
the dates of wins and loses. It kind of gives you an idea of why

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.090
the lines are upward sloping or downward sloping. So you can see

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.260
here, kind of like the exuberance at the beginning of the season as

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.830
people are really optimistic. And then, you know, three losses in a

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.420
row and see how the sentiment dips. This tells a nice story, but

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.960
it doesn't have the feature of, that we'd expect, which is that

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.540
on game day, things change really abruptly. At the very end of the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.960
game, when you know if you've won or you've lost, you're much

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.400
happier or much sadder than you were at the beginning of the game.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.180
So we expect to see really discrete jumps in sentiment

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.030
that we don't see from a model like this. And this

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.470
is because this is a bad model of the underlying data

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.150
generating process. So we need something more flexible. One way to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.470
do that is just to use a seven day moving

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.230
average. Which is going to allow us to include only kind

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.400
of the last game sentiment in the moving average. So we're

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.180
going to pick a moving average, like I showed you before.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.270
Let's smooth it out into over a whole seven day period. And when

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.700
we do that, we get something that actually tells a really nice story

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.270
about the season. And has all the kind of characteristics that I would

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.810
expect as a fan in having gone through this. Which is, the kind

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.960
of, the big bumps up on game days where you win, the big

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.480
bumps down on game days where you lose. And then, kind of, these

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.680
plateaus in between, which are these periods of stability when you don't have

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.470
any information about how your team is doing. We see that a week off

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.420
around Thanksgiving but then there's a big spike in

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.660
happiness because people are [UNKNOWN] Thanksgiving. This big low point

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.100
right after a loss that could have knocked them out

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.740
of the playoffs. And then a big kind of ascension

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.600
to their playoff game which they ended up losing

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.120
and the subsequent dip. This I think is a really

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.090
nice depiction of what happened and it took a little

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.889
bit of averaging to get the story to come out.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.470
&gt;&gt; When you're looking at all this data, what sort

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.720
of things come up for you in terms of bias and

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.680
variance tradeoffs.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.810
&gt;&gt; When you're computing just a simple moving average like this,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.800
you're dealing with one of the most, it's just a really

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.610
flexible statistic. And so you're, not imposing any structure on the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.010
data. You're letting the data kind of speak. When I use a

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.040
moving average here and I plotted standard errors that were kind

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.190
of rolling along with the data. They were gigantic. The mean

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.350
sentiment for the season is somewhere in the three range. And

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.830
the standard errors were over two or three. We can say very

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.050
precisely what's happening at any given point. But our variance

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.130
on that estimate is huge. So as we started to

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.370
add more lags, higher number of lags to the, moving

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.570
average. We end up with kind of smoother looking plots, that

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.480
have lower variance but but then are getting progressively more

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.930
bias. So as we go back further we are including

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.570
more data and were getting more bias. Because were including

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.990
data from parts that actually aren't applicable to that exact point.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.560
But in exchange for that we get a lower variance plot,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.340
one that doesn't move as wildly. When we combine that with

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.710
splines, we can end up fitting a model, that has kind

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.900
of the best of both worlds. Which has the smoothing, aspects of

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.410
the splines, with the discrete jumps, of what happens on game

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.230
day. And so this is a spline where we add it dummy

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.690
variables for post game periods. In this model, we end up

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.090
with kind of all the same thing. We get the big jumps

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.530
that we expect, so it jumps down on loses, jumps up

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.920
on game days where they win. And then also kind of the

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.600
smooth transitions in between. So it's kind of a nice story of

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.440
taking one style of model, which is a spine, which is just

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.210
too specific for the data generating process, and maybe not a good

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.390
fit. And in doing some exploratory data analysis where we see that

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.340
averaging over seven days tells a really nice story and gives us

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.140
the discreteness that we want. And then combining those two together into

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.580
kind of an aggregate of the two types of models. Where We're able

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.990
to better account for the fact that game days, are, are an important thing.
