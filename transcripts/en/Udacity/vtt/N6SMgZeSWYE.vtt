00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.620
What we did here is what's called overriding a method. The eat method that we

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.170
defined in the discerning bear class replaces the eat method in the bear class

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.638
with some new behavior. That means we're replacing a method define by a super

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:17.990
class, the eat method defined in bear with a new method defined in a sub class.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.610
The important property this give us is when the chase method defined in grizzly

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.011
bear calls eat. If it calls it on an instance of the discerning bear, well it

00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:31.400
actually will use the eat method defined by discerning bear. That's why we call

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.063
it overriding.
