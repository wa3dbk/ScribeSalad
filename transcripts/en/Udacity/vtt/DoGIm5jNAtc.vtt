00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Formerly the class NP is the set of non-deterministic polynomial time decidable problems--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that is to say that it's a problem that can be dissolved by a program that runs in polynomial time

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that has non-deterministic elements in it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, I'm going to explain what that is in just a moment,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but first what I'd like to do is give you a handle on intuitively what this means.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'd like to say the NP stands for nice puzzle problems, so let me explain what I mean by that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Think of a problem like solving a Sudoku problem.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You might phrase this as a decision problem by saying here is a grid,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
can this be filled in to complete the Sudoku problem.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It has to satisfy that if you don't know this is a very popular newspaper puzzle that involves--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you're given a bunch of numbers in a 9x9 grid and you have to fill in more numbers,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
you have to fill in all the grid cells and ultimately, the solution that you fill in has to have the property

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that every row in every column has the number 1 through 9 and each block into these dark blocks

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
also has the numbers 1 through 9.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So I can give you a Sudoku like this and it could be very, very challenging to know whether or not

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
this can be completed to satisfy the Sudoku constraints, but the next day in the newspaper

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
or if it's a puzzle magazine, may be at the back of the puzzle magazine.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's very easy to convince you if the answer is yes, so if the answer is yes, then i can prove it you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
by simply giving you a small what's called accepting certificate, which in this case just means

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
a filled in Sudoku board.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So if I filled in Sudoku board, you can very quickly do two things--check to see if it's correct,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
if all the rows and columns have the number 1 through 9--

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that's a polynomial time decision problem that you can write very easily,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and also check if the cells that you're given match what was given in the original puzzle

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and that also is a very fast thing to be able to check.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
All you have to do is run through the cells of the original puzzle and each time

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
there was something that was filled in, check if it matches in the answer.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So even though it maybe very difficult to answer the question if you're given the right kind of information

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
you can check it very fast.
