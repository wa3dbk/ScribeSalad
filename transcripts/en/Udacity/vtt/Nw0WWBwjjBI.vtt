00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.680
Being able to reach out to your
developers is an invaluable asset to

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.620
having a popular API.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.150
Having blogs and forums allow back and
forth communications between client side

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.380
and server side developers, creating
a community around your product.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:18.641
Publishing content via social media and
having code available on GitHub is also

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:21.415
a great way to accumulate followers and
evangelists for your product.

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:25.815
And even when things go wrong,
developers respect a company

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:29.545
that doesn't go into hiding, but rather,
openly communicates major bugs and

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:33.155
outages, so that they can
respond quickly and accordingly.

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:36.950
So, as you're making your own APIs,
make sure there's still a component for

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.480
human communication in order
to better support your users.
