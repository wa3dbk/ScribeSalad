00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.000
Now it's not very practical to
write down every running time

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.039
function exactly, so computer scientists
use various levels of approximation.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.150
For complexity,
we use asymptotic analysis.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.966
I'm going to do a very
brief review here, but

00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:16.196
if you haven't seen this idea before,
you should take a few minutes to study

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:18.334
it on your own before
proceeding with the lesson.

00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:23.377
We define big O of a function
F to be the set of functions

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:29.203
G where there are numbers C and
big N such that for all little N,

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:34.161
at least as big as big N,
G of N is at most C times F of N.

00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:39.041
In other words,
C times F of N is at least G of N for

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:41.850
all sufficiently large N.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.324
Even though we've
defined big O as a set,

00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:52.050
we write g(n) = O (f(n)) instead
of using the inclusion sign.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.560
We also say that G is order F.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.980
This definition can be
a little confusing.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.770
But it should feel like the definition
of a limit from your calculus class.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.940
In fact, we can re-state this
condition to say that the ratio

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.930
of G over F converges to
a constant under the lim soup.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.820
An example also, helps.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.030
Take this function, g of n is equal
to n squared minus n plus ten.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.830
We can argue that this is order n
squared, by choosing c is equal to one.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.210
And big N equal to ten.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.870
For every little n greater than ten,
N squared,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.420
this red line here, is bigger than
the function g, the blue line.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.570
We also could have chosen
c equal to ten and

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.170
big N equal to one again in that case.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.870
The red line, the c times n squared,

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.640
is bigger than the function g,
the blue line.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.140
Note that the big O notation does
not have to create a tight bound.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.480
Thus, g(n) is also order n squared,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.760
setting c equal to 1 and
N equal to 3 works for this.
