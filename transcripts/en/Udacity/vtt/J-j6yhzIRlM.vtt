00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You could almost imagine that there's a conversation

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
going on between a psychic and a detective to solve a murder mystery.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The detective is at a dead end and can't figure out how to solve the murder mystery

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the psychic has this sort of amazing leap--oh, you need to check the finger prints on the body.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This maybe not that amazing of a leap and you'll find that the murderer is Smith.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, we wouldn't arrest someone based on just the word of the psychic.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This detective now actually needs to go and check it out and see that it is actually is true,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and assuming that the psychic is giving checkable information and it's correct,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
then the two of them together should be able to solve the problem.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now the role of the psychic here is actually to pick the accepting certificate,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I don't know out of thin air or somehow, just guess it

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and then the verification algorithm actually can check it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This actually explains this notion guessing a certificate pulling out of thin air.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's not a deterministic process.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's not something that we could just program an algorithm to do

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to just jump right to the right answer and that makes it a non-deterministic step.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's not the kind of thing that you can actually write into a program that proceeds step by step by step.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It sorts of make this crazy leap, non-deterministic leap

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and as long as we can check that leap is correct with the verification algorithm,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we can at least conceptualize that this is a way of solving problems.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We can actually implement a computer like this, but we can imagine a computer

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that we call a non-deterministic computer, non-deterministic turing machine

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that could this sort of magical step

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and that's where NP gets its name, non-deterministic polynomial time.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And just a quick aside, there are actually some researchers working on something like this.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
There's reasons to believe that a quantum computer can do certain kinds of guessing,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
essentially by in parallel kind of imagining all the different situations that all these different certificates

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that might exists, and then designing the algorithm in such a way that the correct certificate

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
will actually bubble up to the top efficiently.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This doesn't exist yet so don't get worry

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
that what your learning in computer science is all completely irrelevant.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It's still relevant for as far as we can tell into the future

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
but the idea of a quantum computer is actually very interesting.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We have reason to believe that the design and analysis of algorithms for quantum computer

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
are going to lean pretty heavily on the stuff that we do for classical computers as well.
