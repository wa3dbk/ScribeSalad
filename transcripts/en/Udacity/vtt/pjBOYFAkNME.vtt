00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.445
Statisticians have determined three conventional levels of likelihood, or

00:00:04.445 --> 00:00:11.440
should I say unlikelihood. If the probability of getting a sample mean is less

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.995
than 0.05, or 5%, 0.01 or 1%, or 0.001, which is 0.1% then it's usually

00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:26.938
considered unlikely. Getting a probability less than 0.1% is just very

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:32.334
unlikely. These are called the alpha levels. Now let's just take a quick quiz

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:36.429
to make sure you understand what alpha levels are. Let's focus on an alpha

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:42.686
level of 0.05. Which of the following are true? If the probability of getting a

00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:47.742
particular sample mean is less than alpha, it is unlikely to occur. For this

00:00:47.742 --> 00:00:52.302
next option, let's say that the z-score here, cutting off the top 5%, is z

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:58.800
star. If a sample mean has a z-score greater than z star, it is unlikely to

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.594
occur. Your third option is if the probability of getting a particular sample

00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:08.885
mean is unlikely. The sample mean is in the orange region. And finally the

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:13.922
alpha level corresponds to the orange region. True or not? Check all that

00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:14.573
apply.
