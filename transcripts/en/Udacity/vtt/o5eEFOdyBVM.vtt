00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.674
A triangle is specified by three points: one, two, and three. We have progressed

00:00:04.674 --> 00:00:09.005
from a zero dimensional point, to a one dimensional line segment, to a two

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:12.955
dimensional triangle. That is even though the coordinates of each object are

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:16.309
specified in three dimensions, the objects themselves have these lower

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.858
dimensions. Two dimensional surfaces are usually as far as we need to go. We

00:00:20.858 --> 00:00:24.476
normally care about how light bounces off an objects surface, we don't care that

00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:28.276
much about representing a solid volume. That is, we don't need to represent

00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:30.403
what's inside the volume in any detail.
