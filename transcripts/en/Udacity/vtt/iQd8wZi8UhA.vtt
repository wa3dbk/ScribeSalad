00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.672
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, let's talk a bit more about color blindness. Look here, and tell me what do

00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:04.270
you see?

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.988
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I see a 74.

00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:09.318
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Great. So, what that means is you're not color blind.

00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:09.901
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome.

00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:14.274
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; at least you're not red-green color blind. People whose long and medium wave

00:00:14.274 --> 00:00:17.986
length cones are not functioning a hundred percent may not be able to see 74 in

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:23.723
here. And so, if a viewer at home can't see this, no big deal. But it does mean

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:27.989
there's probably something a little funny going on with those cones.
