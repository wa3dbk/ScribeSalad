00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.320
In higher level programming languages
there often isn't a distinction between

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.990
linked lists and arrays.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.920
There's just a list that
has the properties of both.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.550
However questions about
these two data structures

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.120
are fairly common in interviews, so
it's important to know the difference.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.990
Again, the main distinction is that each
element stores different information.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.669
In both cases a single
element will store a value.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.630
Or the actual information.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.230
So if you have an array or

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.250
linked list of numbers,
the value will be a single number.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.780
If you have an array or

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.860
linked list of string values,
then each value will contain a string.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.310
In this case we're just
going to stick with numbers.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.260
Now, in both cases we store
one other type of information.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.160
But that type is different.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.639
In an array we would store
a number as an index.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.310
You can get the next element
by querying the array for

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.500
the element at index one in this case.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.690
Let's clear this out and focus.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.940
Just some linked lists for now.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.700
In a linked list, we store a reference
to the next element in the list.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.890
In many languages this will look like
assigning the actual next element

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.290
as a property of this element.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.310
Way down at the hardware
level your element

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.610
actually has some space dedicated for
it in memory.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.700
These are representing
the memory locations.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.420
So in this case, the next component is
actually storing the memory address

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.300
of the next element,
while this element is

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.259
storing null because it doesn't
point to anything else.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.780
The nice thing about the system is
that it's pretty easy to insert and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.390
delete elements.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.400
Adding an element is going to look
something like this, we really just need

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.390
to change the next reference to
point to the new object and done.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.950
There's a quick trick you
need to remember though

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.530
if you delete the next reference and
replace it with a new object.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.240
You'll lose your reference to this
object, you should always assign your

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.140
next pointer for this element before
you assign your next pointer for

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.100
this element, so you don't lose your
reference to this one down here.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.300
Now everything looks great.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.370
Note that insertion takes constant time
in this case since you're just shifting

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.140
around pointers and not iterating
over every element in the list.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.929
Removing an element is going
to look pretty similar, so

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.180
I'm not even going to go over that now.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.970
There's also something
called a doubly linked list

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.100
where you have pointers to the next
element and the previous element.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.970
The rules are pretty similar for
a doubly linked list,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.770
except you can traverse the list
in both directions now.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.700
Again, you need to be careful not
to lose references when adding or

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.380
removing elements but it's easier than
performing these operations on an array.
