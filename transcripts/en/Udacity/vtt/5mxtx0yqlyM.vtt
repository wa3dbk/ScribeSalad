00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.350
Let's do another one you have a sample of size 30. What are the T-critical

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.830
values for a two-tailed test with alpha equals .05. So remember with a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.484
two-tailed test we have two critical regions, one in each tail. And since the T

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:20.571
distribution is symmetrical our t critical value should be positive and

00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:22.523
negative what?
