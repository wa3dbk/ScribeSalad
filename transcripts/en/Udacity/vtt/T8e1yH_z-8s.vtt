00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.695
The last area we're going to discuss in regards to memory, is what's known as

00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:08.640
Long-term Potentiation. Long-term Potentiation is the strengthening of a

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.928
synaptic connection that happens when the synapse of one neuron repeatedly

00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:19.140
fires and excites. Excites another neuron. Much of the work on the study on

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.074
long-term potentiation came from Hebb. Now, you should recall Hebb's law from

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:27.716
our lesson on the brain. Neurons that fire together, wire together. Another

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:31.559
researcher, Kandel, discovered that even as sea slug was able to create a

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:38.203
long-term memory. This was found by how the sea slug reacted to a shock. So,

00:00:38.203 --> 00:00:41.924
what he did was administered a shock to the tail of the sea slug, and the sea

00:00:41.924 --> 00:00:46.995
slug had a defensive response. When he did this only one time, the defensive

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:51.910
posture lasted about ten minutes. However, if you did this four to five times

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.525
in close succession, the sea slug had the same defensive response that lasted

00:00:56.525 --> 00:01:02.911
for days after the shocks. Which shows the sea slug created a long term memory,

00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:08.456
since its response lasted for days. Kandel quoted that conversion from short to

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:14.070
long term memory storage requires spaced repetition. This goes along with the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.142
idea that practice makes perfect, even in snails. So, from research such as

00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:21.418
this, we can see again the importance of neurons firing together and wiring

00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:26.340
together, and the result that changes in our brain and our behavior. Other

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.494
research by Kandel showed how particular genes getting turned on in the nucleus

00:01:30.494 --> 00:01:36.128
of a cell can signal neural structures to grow which is neurogenesis. But this

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:40.953
only happens during long term memory not during short term memory. Amazingly

00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:44.797
what this means is that every time we learn something that's long term it's

00:01:44.797 --> 00:01:50.474
because our brain has actually changed. So, if you remember what we're talking

00:01:50.474 --> 00:01:53.594
about right now in this lesson, next week, that means that your brain has

00:01:53.594 --> 00:01:57.078
officially formed new neural connections which are the basis for your memory of

00:01:57.078 --> 00:02:02.222
this lesson. So you can officially say that your udacity psychology class

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.330
physically changed your brain.
