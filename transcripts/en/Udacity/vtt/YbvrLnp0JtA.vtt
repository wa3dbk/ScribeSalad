00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.438
Let's look at another polynomial function. This time, we have f of x equals x

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:09.682
to the 4th minus x cubed minus 3. Now, on your own piece of paper, I'd like you

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:14.296
to sketch the graph of this function. For the part of the domain where x lies

00:00:14.296 --> 00:00:19.644
between negative 3 and 3. And please include those end points. Now, did you

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:23.643
actually sketch the graph? Please tell me yes or no.
