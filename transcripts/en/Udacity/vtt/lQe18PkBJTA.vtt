I'm here with Kathleen Mullaney,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.019
who's the Vice President
of Careers here at Udacity.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.660
Kathleen, thank you so
much for talking to us today.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.750
&gt;&gt; Thank you, David.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.950
&gt;&gt; So I want to talk to Kathleen
about issues of gender in educational

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.240
technology.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.700
So the first thing I'd ask is, there
is a trend in educational technology,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.860
that because the technology
industry is so dominated by men,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.440
the things we create in Ed Tech,
are often very oriented towards men.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.120
So what can we do to kind of try and
break that cycle?

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.780
&gt;&gt; When I first started at Udacity back
when we were creating the first courses,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.080
we realized that this was actually
going to become quite prevalent.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.870
The first courses we
launched were CS 101,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.740
which is into to computer
programming in Python.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.030
The focus was how to
build a search engine.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.750
And the second course was an A.I. course
focused on how to program a robotic car.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.660
And those seem pretty agnostic.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.370
Now a car and
a search engine are not gender based.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.960
But, there is a tendency to view
those actually as more male oriented.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.880
Like cars in general
are more focused on men.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.440
And we realize that, actually just
choosing topics for the courses and

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.970
the examples that we use in courses
could have a great effect on whether or

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.350
not men or women would be attracted
to take the course to begin with.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.920
It's like one of the things that
we really focused on was trying,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.230
after we saw those first courses and
thought about how we want to market

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.500
future courses, we actually took
a more broadened perspective.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.480
And we tried to actually make things
as agnostic as we possibly could, and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.740
had much more attention to it.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.130
So the first thing that I always tell
people is that you didn't need to be

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.410
aware of the stereotypes that exist for
everybody.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.800
Including I have many stereotypes
of men and women myself,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.260
even though I am very well
educated on this topic.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.766
And so keeping those in mind, and
keeping them at your forefront when

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:52.274
you're designing any kind of
materials it is crucially important,

00:01:52.274 --> 00:01:57.260
making sure that you're not playing
into any standard gender archetypes.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.306
So another example from
the History of Udacity is

00:02:01.306 --> 00:02:05.760
that we produce this course
on Tales from the Genome.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.820
So it was about genetics.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.470
And we had a male and
a female instructor, and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.750
the male was the expert, and
the female was the novice.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.180
And they played this really
nice dynamic on film,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.380
where the novice would
ask the expert questions.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.920
There were times,
though, in the filming,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.370
that we realized that we were
essentially portraying the female

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.410
as this dumb person who didn't
know the answers to things.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.260
When really, she's very intelligent and
has her own background.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.290
She's just not a geneticist.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.230
And that was what we were
trying to portray there.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.730
We didn't want to say that one
person is smarter than the other,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.470
but this person just doesn't
have this expertise.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.850
And it was something that we
didn't actually realize until

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.690
pretty far into filming the course.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.370
And we went through and
actually looked through every video and

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.890
actually said, do we feel that this is
portraying women in a negative light?

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.180
Or playing into these easy
archetypes that, films so

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.890
often use, a woman in distress.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.480
She needs help.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.100
She needs to be saved by this
knight in shining armor.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.990
And we ended up cutting a lot
of content and changing it,

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.680
because we realized we just don't want
to be portraying women in that light.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.000
Another example just to, again, to give
you an idea of how much this is very

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.330
prevalent and how much we don't even
realize it, is that there's a video in

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.240
one of our job rescript courses that had
a complaint from a student that said why

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.590
are you playing into these gender roles?

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.090
Haven't you heard of stereotype threat?

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.020
If you haven't heard
of stereotype threat,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.290
that's where basically
reinforcing a stereotype

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.440
in the context where a stereotype
is typically threatened.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.480
I guess that's the name, is more likely
to cause those issues than not, so, for

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.090
example, women are told by society that
they're not as good at math as men are.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.780
And if you ask the woman to state her
gender before she takes a math test,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.290
she will do worse on that math test.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.070
And so, that's what stereotype is,
as an example.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.700
And what we realized is that,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.839
we were naming variables
in this JavaScript course.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.700
Completely what we thought was benign.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.930
But somebody saw that, you know,
we named one of the variables gal.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.230
The variable it was supposed to be
a hero so it was definitely portraying

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.310
women in a positive light, but
pointing out that there are women

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.250
in a situation where they may already
feel that they're not confident.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.780
May actually cause people to
think of their abilities as less,

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.750
which I don't necessarily agree in this
scenario but just to point out the of

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.810
the issues that may come up and how
much you do need to be aware of them.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.200
So I would say like the basic thing that
you can do is to educate yourself on

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.380
on the dynamics that
we know exist today.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.900
So talking about stereotypes and
bias in particular.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.260
And not only with gender, though I don't
if we're talking about diversity at

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.250
large, but
as with any underrepresented group.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.530
In computer science or
in technology in general.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Do you know, and

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.990
I assume your familiar with imposter
syndrome in this context as well, can

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.430
you comment on that in the same kind of-
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.300
it's very similar to stereotyping.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.220
They go hand in hand oftentimes.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.650
So imposter syndrome is that,
and I feel this all the time.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.460
I'm a high-level executive at this
company, and I still feel this.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.810
&gt;&gt; I have a PhD, and
I feel the exact same way.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.557
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
[LAUGH] It's like oh I don't

00:05:34.557 --> 00:05:36.300
have the answer to this yeah.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.100
It's basically you feel that
you don't have the expertise

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.990
that you need to fulfill a position or
fulfill a job.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.900
And this is actually one of
the things that I mentor girls,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.070
especially the girls who code groups
that nobody knows what they're doing.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.390
Nobody, I mean it.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.450
Like I don't know any one person who
actually knows what they're doing all

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.710
the time.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.300
And it's fun to actually at least be
in the start of environment because

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.900
we try to raise that fact as
much as we possibly really can.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.950
I don't know if Sebastian liked
to mention his failure award.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.161
So if you try to break the company,
and we've succeeded at various points.

00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:14.372
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes we have.

00:06:14.372 --> 00:06:17.470
&gt;&gt; He rewards you with a bottle of wine,
a nice bottle of wine.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.680
And the whole point here is that
it's said to highlight this fact,

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.270
I think at least,
to counter this imposter syndrome,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.170
that you're acting out of fear because
you think that you can't do something.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.140
Because you're not smart enough or
you don't have the right experience or

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.640
the number of years of experience or
the specific background.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.420
A number of people at Udacity
work in computer science.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.350
They don't have computer
science degrees.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.030
A number of our students in particular
do not have computer science degrees but

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.880
are looking to get into
the technical field.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.210
One of the most frequent questions
I receive is really focusing on

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.000
how can I get a job here when
they say a CS degree is required.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.090
I have to counsel people on they say
this but that's really just this

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.800
shortcut that people use to say
people just want a certain level of

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.040
understanding of these topics or
a certain level of work experience.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.590
And time after time I talk to employers
and actually tried to assist this out.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.460
And they say, no,
we don't actually want assist really,

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.540
we just really want to know
like do you know this stuff.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.240
And so that's what we focus on
Udacity its like know the stuff, and

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.770
do it in a way that is more flexible and
it meet your needs rather than having to

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.080
go back and
get a second degree often times.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.697
was a very long answer to that question.

00:07:30.697 --> 00:07:31.770
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's all right.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.670
I ask on imposter syndrome because
we've done some interesting research on

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.890
imposter syndrome in the OMS.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.990
And it's interesting that the research
came out that suggested that

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.620
people who experience imposter
syndrome more strongly

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.150
are less likely to take a chance on
an experimental program like this.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.170
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.
&gt;&gt; Because

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.360
if it doesn't end up panning out,
it reflects poorly on me.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.570
And I'm already an imposter,
so now people recognize that.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.
&gt;&gt; And so,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.330
I think combating that in
this program is really,

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.920
really important because it
helps increase our diversity.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.780
Because the people who more often
experience that are the ones we

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.590
really want in this program anyway.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah, have you talked about growth or
fixed mindsets in that context?

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.480
&gt;&gt; We've talked about it a little
bit in one of the other lessons

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.430
on motivation and meta cognition.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.480
So yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.440
the best ways to counteract an imposter
syndrome is to have a growth mindset

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.530
intervention to highlight that, you
know making mistakes helps you learn.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.440
It doesn't actually show
that you're stupid or

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.310
that you don't have
the ability to do something.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
In fact, no one ever learns

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.380
really anything except for by failure.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.000
&gt;&gt; So Kathleen will agree with me that
mindset is the one book that everyone

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.758
should read I assume.

00:08:31.758 --> 00:08:33.010
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yep. [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And so

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.760
we talk a lot about doing
this in Ed Tech and

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.049
how to design educational technology
initiatives that do this.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.929
But many of our students probably
won't go into this field, but

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.520
they'll go into fields that
suffer from these same issues.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.039
&gt;&gt; Yep, totally.
&gt;&gt; So

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.400
just when they're on
the job in the future,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.340
what can they do to try and
improve diversity in their workplace,

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.990
without being kind of pandering, or
some of the things we more often see?

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:56.220
&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah, I guess the first
thing is that if you are not

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.410
an underrepresented group that
doesn't mean you can't participate in

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.770
trying to actually alleviate
the issues that these groups encounter.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.698
If you are a white male, sorry Dave.

00:09:09.698 --> 00:09:12.470
&gt;&gt; It's okay.
&gt;&gt; The things you can do are educate

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.288
yourself and help promote
these issues to other people.

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:18.390
I noticed actually when I first
brought up the issue of bias and

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:23.410
stereotype with the company here, one of
the things that came up, is you're like,

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:28.330
I am a white man, I feel like I can't
participate, because I'm the enemy.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.710
No, you're not the enemy,

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.655
that's actually not what
we're trying to say here.

00:09:33.655 --> 00:09:37.080
A stereotype is a shortcut
in your cognitive process.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.850
It's something that you see something
over and over and over again, and

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.620
your brain just makes a shortcut.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.010
And it helps you think about things.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.460
It actually helps you in
your life quite a bit.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.240
We're not saying that
all stereotypes are bad.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.630
You just need to understand
the ones that are,

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:56.550
and the ones that result in
poor judgment or behavior.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:02.840
And a bias also is the shortcut,
but it's also an error.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.170
So if you talk about like in research.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.670
A bias is actually just
an error in measurement.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.270
And so what we want to do
is actually just again,

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:14.130
the awareness of these things helps
cut down the effects of them.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:19.300
I don't know the exact statistic
right now, but a pretty big amount.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:26.350
And so educate yourself on the issues
that face people in these groups.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:31.530
So for the technology industry,
it's something about

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:36.600
20 to 30% female on a good day and
if that's the case,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.500
then what are the things you can do
to actually get, to be more equal.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.570
And actually, probably educating
yourself on why that's even important.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.397
The point isn't just to have equality,

00:10:46.397 --> 00:10:48.340
the point is to have
diversity of thought.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:53.670
And you're not going to have diversity
of thought if everybody looks the same,

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:58.180
has had the same education,
comes from the same type of family and

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.050
from the same like economic background.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.110
So businesses,

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:06.883
it's actually shown you know through
research again that businesses that

00:11:06.883 --> 00:11:11.210
have diverse employees are more
successful than ones that are not.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.984
So understanding like why
you actually want this and

00:11:13.984 --> 00:11:17.702
the more logical reasons rather than
the emotional ones are just like I

00:11:17.702 --> 00:11:19.670
don't want there to be inequality.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.990
And actually try to
move the needle based

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:30.350
on logic rather than emotional
responses to the situation.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.330
&gt;&gt; Have you read Thinking Fast and Slow?

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah it's a good book.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.610
&gt;&gt; If you all haven't heard of it,
it's a great book.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.080
I wouldn't have even
connected it to this, but

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.500
I'm glad you mentioned about shortcuts.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.770
It talks a lot about how
stereotypes are just kind of

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.500
easy ways to think that
we fall into because

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.400
we can't think deeply about every
single thing we encounter all day long.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:46.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.
&gt;&gt; But

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.930
being aware of them is really
the quickest way to know

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:50.770
when you're doing it badly.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.040
&gt;&gt; And not feeling like
you're doing something wrong.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I noticed another example.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.460
Hopefully theses are helpful for
you guys.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.930
One of the stereotypes,
and again the biases,

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:07.220
that comes in to play is that women are
more often judged by their character,

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:13.750
so by how likable they are, and men
are more often judged by their skills.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.490
Which is really ridiculous, especially
when it comes into interviewing.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.040
And so
it's something that I work on very,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.720
very much with our Udacity students
in helping them apply for jobs.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.680
For the most part people
are not interviewing you for

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.550
how likable you are.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.850
They're interviewing you because they
want you to perform a specific function

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.170
in a company.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.400
And it's important for if you're
an interviewer to remember that and

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.100
also as an interviewee because you
want to make sure that you're not giving

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.940
any easy paths for an interviewer
to fall into and basically say, oh,

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.740
I'm going to choose the shortcut.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.950
And so the things that you can actually
do are to enforce that you have

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.870
the skills for a job, in your rhetoric
in your answers to interview questions.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.300
Highlight that you have the skills.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.160
Don't just smile a lot and be likeable.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.330
That's also an important trait.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.810
I'm not saying that that's
not important at all,

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.510
but you can make it easier for
yourself and for

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:13.310
the people who can easily be tracked
by stereotypes to come out on top.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.580
I know that when I was interviewing for
a candidate I was writing all of my

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.440
feedback about this interview that I had
just completed and I was saying how she

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.400
had a really sunny disposition and
I was like, what am I talking about?

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.930
That has nothing to do with this job and
for me,

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.920
once I realized that, that's when
I decided actually to start doing

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.760
these talks here at Udacity because if
I, this is one of my favorite topics.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.080
If I'm so susceptible to this despite
the amount that I read about it,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.030
that I do my research,
that I try to help others and

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.570
I'm still falling into these traps.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.420
We need to make it as prevalent so
that I have support.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.820
So I get a team of people to help
me actually do better myself.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.920
It's kind of like if you're
trying to lose weight.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.640
You're much more likely to
succeed if you have some social

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.460
pressure to help you
with achieving your goal.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.050
&gt;&gt; So if you wife was to say,
David you're trying to lose weight, so

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:09.570
let's make sure we're not keeping
cookies in the house, or whatever.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.170
You're going to have more support.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:11.900
And so-
&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.700
Accountability.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.730
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
So this accountability is important if

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.230
we're able to help each other learn
about these things and be active,

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:22.120
rather than passive about
the efforts to improve them.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.970
Personally, I think that's what
would lead to more success.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, I agree completely.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.650
Do you have any last thoughts you
want to share with our students, as they

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.660
prepare to embark on their projects,
or maybe wrap up their projects?

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess one of the things that
I wish I had understood a little sooner,

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:42.410
was really think about,
if you're designing a course or

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.700
a product, think about your learner or
your user.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.660
And really understand who that person
is, or who that group of people are.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.310
And do your best to limit it,
because making a product for

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.290
everybody will never win.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.210
And really try to reach that person.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:01.990
I mean I think once we were
able to actually figure out

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.150
some of the individuals that we were
reaching with the Udacity courses.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.470
We got a lot better about creating
content that fit their needs.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.750
I think really just focus on your user,
and make sure that

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:18.680
you know who that person is, so that
you are solving a problem for them, or

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.570
you're helping them achieve whatever
goal that they're trying to achieve.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.110
&gt;&gt; Make sense.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.700
&gt;&gt; Well great.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.770
Thank you so much for
talking to us today, Kathleen.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:26.770
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.852
Good luck with your projects.

00:15:27.852 --> 00:15:31.126
