00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.912
Now that we have a general form for the shifted version of the parabola y equals

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:07.880
x squared. Let's work with this a little bit. A lot of parabolas we see don't

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.997
have equations that are already in this form. So to see what other equations we

00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:16.155
could eventually get back to this general form, I'd like you to multiply out the

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.898
right side of the equation. Then make sure that you combine like terms.
