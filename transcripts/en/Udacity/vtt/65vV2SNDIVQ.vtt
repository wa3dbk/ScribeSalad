00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.106
Let's go through each of these statements to decide whether or not they're each

00:00:03.106 --> 00:00:08.200
true. So, first things first, all functions have inverses. Well we know that

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.693
that's not true. Some functions, like y equals x squared, don't pass the

00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:17.424
horizontal line test. So, this doesn't have an inverse. We can't check this

00:00:17.424 --> 00:00:21.344
first one off then. Moving onto the second one, we have all inverse functions

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:26.540
have inverses. This one is true. If we start off with one function, and reflect

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.982
it across the line y equals x. If we start off with one function, and then

00:00:30.982 --> 00:00:34.384
reflect it across the line, y equals x and end up with another function, then

00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:39.423
the second function is the inverse of the first one. But if we reflect the

00:00:39.423 --> 00:00:42.216
second one back across the line y equals x again, we'll end up with its

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:46.564
inverse, which is the first one. This is basically the same as the property I

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:50.891
showed you before. If we have a function f inverse that we know is the inverse

00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:56.660
of f, and then we take its inverse, that just equals the original function f.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.635
So yes to the second choice. Now third, we have a function's domain can

00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:06.035
influence whether or not it has an inverse. This one is definitely true. We saw

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:09.512
this with our parabola, which we took only portions of, and saw that those

00:01:09.512 --> 00:01:14.130
portions had inverses, while the whole parabola didn't. And we also saw the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.667
same thing with our absolute value function. Fourth, all functions pass the

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:22.305
vertical and horizontal line tests. Well all functions pass the vertical line

00:01:22.305 --> 00:01:26.196
tests. That's how we know that they're functions. But not often past the

00:01:26.196 --> 00:01:31.399
horizontal line test. So this isn't true. The last choice however, is true. All

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.211
inverse functions pass both the vertical and horizontal line tests. Inverse

00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:40.762
functions are functions, so they pass the vertical line test, and since inverse

00:01:40.762 --> 00:01:44.207
functions all have inverses as we've already decided, that means they have to

00:01:44.207 --> 00:01:48.934
cross the horizontal line test, as well. Now I personally think this was a

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:52.589
really, really tough quiz. This required you to show some very in-depth

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:55.785
understanding of inverse functions, and to think really critically about all of

00:01:55.785 --> 00:02:00.749
these statements. Awesome job on this quiz and on the entire lesson.
