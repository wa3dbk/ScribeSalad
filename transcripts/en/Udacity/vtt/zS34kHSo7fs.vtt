00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.490
There are a couple particularly
notable types of paths and graphs.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.120
Here, a path is just a specific route
you take in a traversal or search.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.900
For example, you could create a path
that travels through every edge in

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.340
a graph at least once.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.620
That path is called an Eulerian path.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.890
Yes, it's pronounced Eulerian after
the famous mathematician Euler.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.270
In a basic Eulerian path,
you start at one node,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.600
traverse through all edges and
might end up at a different node.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.965
In an Eulerian cycle, you must
traverse every edge only once and

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:38.865
end up at the same node
that you started with.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.850
It turns out that not every graph is
capable of having an Eulerian path.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.225
In this graph,
no matter where you start,

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:51.250
you'll get stuck on one of these
outer nodes and won't be able to

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.745
reach the other nodes without traveling
over an edge you've already seen.

00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:57.400
There's a nice trick here.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.400
Our good friend Euler said that graphs
can only have Eulerian cycles if

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.950
all vertices have an even degree or an
even number of edges connected to them.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.560
Eulerian paths are a little
bit more lenient.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.650
So it's okay for your graph to
have two nodes with an odd degree

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.500
as long as they're the start and
end of the path.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.710
Let's look at a quick algorithm for
finding Eulerian cycles.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.539
You can start at any vertex and

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.210
follow edges until you
return back to that vertex.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.690
If you didn't encounter every edge,
you can start from an unseen edge

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.929
connected to a node
you've already visited.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.670
Again, you create a path
through those unseen edges.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.290
You can continue this
process until you've seen

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.810
every edge in the graph once.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.149
Then you can simply add
the paths together,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.320
combining them at the nodes
they have in common.

00:01:52.515 --> 00:01:54.296
This algorithm is really efficient.

00:01:54.296 --> 00:02:00.170
It takes big O of the number of edges
since it visits every edge once,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.560
which is the best we could hope for.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.530
A Hamiltonian path is
another type of path

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.860
that must go through every vertex once.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.910
Similarly, a Hamiltonian cycle will
start and end with the same vertex.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.270
Trying to decide whether
a graph has a Hamiltonian path

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.810
is a famous issue in computer science
called the Hamiltonian path problems.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.859
We don't quite have the tools
to talk about it yet, but

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.980
we'll talk about similarly
famous problems very soon.
