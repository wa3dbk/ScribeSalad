00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.296
The problem that we'll use for this lesson was one that was suggested by one of

00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:08.508
our students for the make practice for unit two. And this is the one that we'll

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:12.352
use and it was a problem that was suggested by Matias Wexen from Sweden, as a

00:00:12.352 --> 00:00:17.002
practice problem for unit two. And here's how he stated the problem. This is

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:20.479
days old number two and it says given your birthday and the current dates,

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:24.688
calculate you age in days. You have to beware about leap days. Dates are

00:00:24.688 --> 00:00:28.916
complicated things. And you can assume that the inputs are correct dates. And

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:33.268
then, there's an example here to say that, well, if you were born on January 1,

00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:37.200
2012, and the date today is January 2, 2012, you're 1 day old. So, this is a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.038
great practice problem. Thanks, Matias for suggesting it. And it's generated

00:00:41.038 --> 00:00:44.482
lots of discussion on the forums. So, I wanted to step through how I would solve

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:48.204
this problem. If you have not tried it yourself, I would strongly encourage you

00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:52.032
to do so. There's a link to the problem in the additional homework to try it

00:00:52.032 --> 00:00:55.221
yourself. And I'd suggest keeping notes on how you solve it. Whether you're able

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.940
to solve it or not, I hope you'll come back and watch the rest of this lesson.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.800
If you got stuck, this lesson will give you some ideas of how to get unstuck.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.424
And then, when you get unstuck, go back to trying to solve it on your own before

00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:06.750
continuing with the lesson. If you were able to solve it yourself, that's great.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.928
This is quite a challenging problem. But I hope you'll still come back to see

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:13.312
how I solve it. I think you'll, perhaps, learn some things from the way I would

00:01:13.312 --> 00:01:16.580
approach it and probably I can learn some things from the way you approached it.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.658
So, I hope you'll post on the forum about how you approached it that was

00:01:19.658 --> 00:01:20.213
different.
