00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.870
It turns out that when we add, subtract, multiply or divide, we can do it to

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:08.032
both sides of the scale. This also works for equations. These properties have a

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:12.005
special name, and they're called the properties of equality. Let's use these

00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:16.091
properties of equality to solve a more challenging problem. We know equations

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:20.357
work like scales, so when we write an equation, we know the side on the left, or

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.489
that value, matches the value on the right. Equations work just like scales.

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:28.807
We're saying that this number, or this value on the left, is the same as this

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:33.222
number, or the value on the right. So, using what you know about the properties

00:00:33.234 --> 00:00:37.576
of equality, what do you think the unknown weight m is? Can you find it's value?
