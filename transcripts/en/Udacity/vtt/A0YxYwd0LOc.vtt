00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.428
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well we know that we want A over here to equal 300. Now for the length, which

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:08.987
was originally 15 feet, you want to tack on an extra distance of x to it. So our

00:00:08.987 --> 00:00:13.581
length will be 15 plus x. We do a similar thing for our width. It's going to be

00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:18.178
10 plus x. So here's our equation. And of course it does not matter which order

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:23.115
you have these factors in because of the commutative property of multiplication.
