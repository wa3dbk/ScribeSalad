00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.360
So now, let's say that this is a sampling distribution. Because of this, we know

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:12.835
that 95% of sample means fall within 1.96 standard deviations, or in this case

00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:19.360
standard errors, from the population mean. This is exactly the same concept you

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.886
learned before, except before we were estimating, about 95% or within two

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:28.334
standard deviations of the mean. But now, we are just going to use exact values

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:33.330
and we're going to do that from now on. So, exactly 95% of sample means fall

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:40.373
within 1.96 standard errors from the population mean in a sampling distribution.
