00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.856
Now that we can spawn entities, we need to keep tract of them, update them as

00:00:02.856 --> 00:00:06.848
necessary, and kill them off when they refuse to comply with our wishes! In

00:00:06.848 --> 00:00:10.196
order to do this, the game engine keeps a list of active entities that it can

00:00:10.196 --> 00:00:14.950
then use to iterate over during our update and render functions later.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.534
Implement the functionality in the given code calling each entity's update

00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:20.819
method in the given function.
