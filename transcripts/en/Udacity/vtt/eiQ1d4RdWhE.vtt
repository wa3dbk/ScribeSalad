I did want to mention, the touch

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.210
events, and therefore, pointer events, can come in

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.920
very fast. Most touch, input devices, actually, give

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.810
a lot more data, than most mice do.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.360
So, what should you do, in response, to

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.520
this? Should you just upgrade, your computer? Ask

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.190
your users, to move, their fingers more slowly?

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.180
Or, maybe, there's something that request animation frame?
