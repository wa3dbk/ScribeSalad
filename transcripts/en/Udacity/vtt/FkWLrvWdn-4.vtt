00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.606
Now, since I'm super picky, as you know. I really would like our interval width

00:00:04.606 --> 00:00:09.540
to be just 1/10 instead of 2/10 like it is right now. So what value of x should

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.601
we check next in our function? Please fill that in here. Once you've figured

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:16.940
that out, please fill that value in to these two boxes right here, to show the

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.956
two different possible intervals we would have using that x value. Then pick

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:25.319
which region of the graph the zero actually lies in.
