[Norvig] Okay, so we're going great and we're almost done.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We just need to implement kind and 2 pair.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So let's write some tests first, as usual.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Again, I'll do the tests for you.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So what I've added here is one more card or one more hand to deal with--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
2 pairs, a pair of 5s and 9s with a 6 left over--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then I pulled out the ranks of 4 of a kind ranks and 2 pair ranks

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
by calling card_ranks,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and then I made these assertions.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So is there a 4 of a kind in the 4 of a kind ranks? Yes, there is.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And in fact, it's a 9, those four 9s.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Is there a 3 of a kind there? No, there's not.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We're asking for exactly 3, not at least 3,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and so there's 4 but there's not 3.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Is there a 2 of a kind there? No.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Is there 1 of a kind? Yes, there is. There's four 9s and there's one 7.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So 1 of a kind in 4 of a kind ranks is yes, there is. There's a 7.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And then in terms of 2 pair, does the 4 of a kind have 2 pair?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
No, it doesn't, so we return None.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And does the 2 pair have 2 pair? Yes, it does, a 9 and a 5.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm going to ask you to write the kind function, which takes the n of a kind you're looking for,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the list of ranks, and it returns the rank that that hand has exactly n of if there is one

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and returns None otherwise.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And it should go through the ranks in left to right order

00:01:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and find the first one that corresponds to n of a kind.
