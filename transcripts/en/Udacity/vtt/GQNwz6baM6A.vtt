00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The second part of the answer to this problem is to do a good job is that as the person

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
running the random tester--you need to do a pretty good job filtering the bugs that you find

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so that you only pass the ones that look important.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The ones that look like there might be critical or security problems or something

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
onto the developers, and if you find a bunch of bugs that they never see, this isn't a problem.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If you find a bunch of bugs that they're never going to see,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
this isn't necessarily a problem but it uses your time.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If you find a bunch of bugs that you never pass on to developers, this isn't necessarily a problem.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You've learned interesting things about the software under test and if you make the decision

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to not pass this on then that's probably okay.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's not uncommon for a simple random tester to spend all its time performing boring tests.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
For example, if we do a bad job generating html then maybe all our test

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
result in rejection by the html cursor and we never find anything interesting.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I have two responses to this kind of thing.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
One response is to simply put more resources into the random tester.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
For example, we can use more course.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We can use machines with more memory or maybe we can just make random tester faster

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
by reusing the size of the inputs through a generator.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The other response as we've discussed several times

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is to make the random test case generator smarter.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That is to say to use our human expertise or human knowledge of the domain of interest

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in order to generate manual test cases that aren't boring.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Random tester may find the same bug many many many times

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and if we're going to automatically reject repeated instances of a bug, this isn't a problem.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
On the other hand, if we don't have an automated way to do triage of issues that we found,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
then this can really waste somebody's time and this issue, we'll talk about explicitly a little bit later.
