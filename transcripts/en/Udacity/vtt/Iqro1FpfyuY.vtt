00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.220
There are several noteworthy features of this constraint.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.540
The first is the use of the implies keyword to denote logical implication,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.320
which is just a way of saying the restriction is only true for children.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.910
It is equivalent to the use of the right right arrow in first order logic.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.170
The second feature is the, the OCL use of the right arrow,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:31.520
this one with only one horizontal line. And that's used with collection classes.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.980
So in the case where there's a collection on the left hand side and you wish to,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.946
access or make use of one of the built in operations in this case size,

00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:48.140
you can use this right arrow

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.850
to say you'd like to bring in the size operation on this particular collection

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.670
class. The other types of collections that we'll get to but

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.860
all of them have a size operation associated with it
