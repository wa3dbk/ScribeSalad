[Dave] Question 7, test if you understand how to use the find method.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Assume that the variable text holds a string.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Your goal is to write some Python code that prints out the position

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
of the first occurrence of hoo, H-O-O,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in the value of text or -1 if the string hoo

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
does not occur at all in text.
