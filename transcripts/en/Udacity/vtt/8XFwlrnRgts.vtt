00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.480
So that's your minimum intervening scheduling policy that

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.330
is ensuring that the processor that is picked

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.500
for T i to run on has the

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.380
highest affinity for T i. That's the minimum intervening.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.800
And there's a variant of minimum intervening, which

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.810
is called limited min, minimum intervening, which is essentially

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.550
saying that if I have let's say, 1,000

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.440
processes in the multiprocessor then the amount of information

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.290
that I want to keep for every one of these

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.340
threads is huge, right? For every processor that is

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.510
available in the multiprocessor, I need to keep this

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.890
affinity index for this thread. At maybe too much meta

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.140
data that this scheduler has to maintain on behalf

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.310
of every thread. And therefore, that means there's a variant

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.850
of minimum intervening which is called limited minimum intervening.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.520
Which is saying, don't keep this infinity index for all

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.990
the processors. Just keep it for the top

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.410
few processors. So if the infinity index, if it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.980
is two or three, those are the ones that I care about. If the infinity index is

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.290
20 or 30 I'm not going to pick that,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.700
so why bother keeping all of the affinity index

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.220
for a particular thread? Just keep the top candidates.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.940
That's the idea behind limited minimum intervening scheduling policy.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.790
The last policy I'm going to introduce you to. It's called

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.810
Minimum Intervening Plus Queueing. The idea is still the same

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.000
that I want to look at whether Intervening Threads that

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.100
ran on a particular processor with respect to this thread

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.670
that I am trying to schedule at this point of

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.360
time. But when I make a scheduling decision that Ti

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.590
is going to run on a particular processor It may be

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.160
that this particular processor Pj may already have some other threads

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.460
that are going to run on it, and that's the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.330
idea behind minimum intervening plus queue. Again, I want to explain

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.240
this in a little bit more detail. So in

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.320
minimum intervening scheduling plus queuing wouldn't be the same as

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.670
It's not only the affinity index of Ti with

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.600
respect to a particular processor I'm going to look at, but

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.350
I'm also going to look at the queue for this particular

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.320
processor. Why do we need to know do that? Well,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.389
if Ti is going to be scheduled on,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.570
on this particular processor PJ. Maybe there's a

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.970
scheduling queue associated with PJ, which already has

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.020
some number of threads to be run. And

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.660
therefore, even though I'm picking the process of

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.300
PJ based on cash affinity. By the time

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.860
TI gets to actually run. Two other threads

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.450
are going to run before it, so this was

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.370
when Ti ran last, and I might find the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.270
definitive for Ti with respect to Pj, is two,

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.540
just like in this previous example that I gave

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.290
you, the affinity is two, so it looks like

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.130
a good choice to put ti on, on pj, if this turns out to be There are the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.600
minimum, but when I made that decision, what I'm

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.370
going to do is I'm going to stick this thread Ti in

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.950
the scheduling queue of Pj and if the scheduling queue of Pj has Tm and Tn

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.670
already populated, then what's going to happen Time is

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.120
now, but by the time Ti gets to

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.740
run on the process of Pj, Tm and Tn would also have run on the processor. Right?

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.540
So even though the affinity index that I computed at the point of the scheduling

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.140
decision, the scheduling decision, at the scheduling decision I made the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.290
decision to put Ti on Pj based on its affinity with respect to

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.710
processor Pj. But unfortunately, the reality is that Ti is not going to

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.850
run immediately, but it is going to run much later

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.960
in time, and by the time it gets to

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.770
run, two other threads that are already sitting in

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.820
the Q of Pj, they're going to run. And therefore,

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.580
the cache will be more polluted [LAUGH] than what

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.300
we thought it was going to be at this point

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.460
of time. So that's the reason that this scheduling

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.420
policy's called minimum intervening plus Q, saying that. Not only

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.820
should you ta, take into account the affinity index

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.680
of a thread with respect to a particular processor, but

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.630
you should also look at the Q of the

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.740
processor. And ask the question, is the Q already populated?

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.180
In that case, the, the processor that I want to pick Ti to run on is the min

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.220
of i plus q where i if the affinity index and q is the size

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.610
of the scheduling q associated with this particular

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.240
processor pj. So that's the last scheduling policy.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.546
So basically have introduced five different scheduling policies,

00:04:34.546 --> 00:04:38.970
first come first serve. Fixed processor, last processor,

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.480
minimum intervening, and minimum intervening plus queuing and as

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.770
I mentioned, these two scheduling policies will really not be

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.080
having the information for a thread with respect to all

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.260
the processors in the system, because in a large scale

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.730
process it may be invisible to do that. So

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.620
what you do is, you limit the amount of information

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.250
that you keep for every one of these threads. Remember

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.980
one of the attributes of a good operating system is

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.000
to make a decision really quickly and get out of

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.930
the way, and from that point of view the less

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.950
information it has to sift through in order to make

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.980
a scheduling decision, the faster it can do it's work.
