00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.815
So now we've divided our search engine code into two modules, the crawler that

00:00:03.815 --> 00:00:07.474
builds the corpus this is everything we can do before the query. The search

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:12.186
engine, that responds to query, this is everything that we do after a query

00:00:12.186 --> 00:00:16.401
starting with a known corpus. We're going to add a third module which we'll call

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:21.481
test.py. That uses these two, that does some test building a corpus using our

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:26.677
lucky search and ordered search to do some queries. So now the question is how

00:00:26.677 --> 00:00:31.458
do we need to set up imports to make this work? So here are the choices: search

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:36.203
needs to import crawler, crawler needs to import search, test needs to import

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:40.920
crawler, test needs to import search, search needs to import test. Check all of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.099
the ones that are true.
