00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.830
When an object is rendered into an image, at each pixel, the distance from the

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.066
object to the camera is used to compute its z depth, a value from 0 to 1. So,

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:13.328
here for example, I've rendered a sphere. And at this pixel, I found that the

00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:17.724
depth of the sphere in 0.6. This value is then checked against the current value

00:00:17.724 --> 00:00:21.882
stored in the z buffer. Which you'll recall, we've initialized to all ones. If

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:25.664
the object's distance is lower than the z depth value stored, the object is

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:29.464
closer to the camera. And so the color of the object is then stored in the

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:33.484
image's color buffer. So, in this case, the sphere's depth is clearly closer

00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:37.734
than the maximum value can store in the z depth. So it's visible at this point.

00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:42.836
let's say we draw a cube. The cube's depth at this pixel is 0.3, which is closer

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:48.354
than the 0.6 that we have storage for what the sphere did. So, since its closer,

00:00:48.354 --> 00:00:55.374
we use the cube's color at this pixel and replace this value, 0.3 replaces 0.6.

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:59.540
Say, the last object we draw is this ground plane. At the pixel, it turns out

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.924
the ground plane's depth is 0.8. This is higher than the current z depth 0.3.

00:01:04.924 --> 00:01:08.895
So, the ground plane fails, which is as it should be because the ground plane is

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:13.182
obviously farther away than these two objects. The final conclusion of this

00:01:13.182 --> 00:01:17.854
process is that the current z depth stays at 0.3 and the color that's stored at

00:01:17.854 --> 00:01:22.234
the pixel, this blue cube, is indeed the color that gets displayed on the

00:01:22.234 --> 00:01:26.659
screen. By storing a depth at each pixel, the GPU can mindlessly keep track of

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.762
what object is closest at any given moment. What's interesting to realize is

00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:34.125
that decades ago, when this idea first came up, of the z buffer, it was

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:37.960
considered absurdly expensive because you had to add a big chunk of memory of z

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.908
depth buffer that was just an outrageous amount. You'd have to add a whole mega

00:01:41.908 --> 00:01:45.520
byte of memory which would be outrageously expensive. So, this algorithm

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.670
originally was a terrible idea. And memory costs came down just a tad and now

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.812
it's the predominant way of rasterizing triangles.
