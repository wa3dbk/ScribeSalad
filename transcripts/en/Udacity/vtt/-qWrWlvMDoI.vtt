Over the years,
HL7 has expanded greatly from messaging.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.900
Some would now argue that it's
becoming overly complex and

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.870
virtually impossible to fully implement.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.730
In what follows, I'll give you an
overview of the many key components of

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.530
HL7 with a particular emphasis on
those that are key to data sharing for

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.700
care coordination and
patient engagement.
