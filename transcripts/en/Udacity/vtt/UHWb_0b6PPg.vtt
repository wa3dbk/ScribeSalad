Now that you've seen how crazy things can get, the goal is for you to fill out

00:00:03.312 --> 00:00:07.835
the rest of the onTouch function for the EnergCanisterClass. Now don't forget,

00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:11.026
the energy canister is something that you picked up to receive energy. Energy

00:00:11.026 --> 00:00:14.842
is effectively ammo inside of grits. Now, the onTouch function has some of the

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:18.331
setup that we saw for a simple projectile class. Your goal, is that in this

00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:21.748
onTouch function, we will update the entity of the touching physOwner, and then

00:00:21.748 --> 00:00:24.340
mark this object for deletion.
