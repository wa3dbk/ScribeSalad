Well, first of all, we have an external CSS

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.300
file which we need to construct the CSSOM. So, if

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.039
I inline that, then that could save a lot

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.490
of time. Same goes for JavaScript. If I inline that,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.700
then we can skip the request. And in fact,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.630
if I inline both, then that's even better because my

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.050
critical path length will be one. As soon as

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.880
I have my HTML file, I have everything I need.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.370
&gt;&gt; Yep, that's right. Those are definitely good strategies. Just be careful

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.120
when you apply them. Remember that inlining

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.460
a lot of JavaScript and CSS, especially when

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.710
those resources can be used between multiple

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.930
pages, can lead to a lot of overhead.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.610
&gt;&gt; Right. Right. Good point. Alright, speaking of which, I guess, I

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.850
don't know if this applies to this exact case, but if I knew

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.960
what was inside the CSS and JavaScript files, then I could also

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.900
consider adding a media type to the CSS or making the script async.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.380
&gt;&gt; Yep, you got it. Just to confirm though, what would

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.900
you look for in the CSS and JavaScript files?

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.060
&gt;&gt; Well, for CSS, I'd want to make

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.240
sure the styles are actually required to render the

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.670
page. If they're not being used, I could

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.170
add an appropriate media tag to attribute and unblock

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.940
rendering. Also, it's pretty much the same idea

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.480
for JavaScript. If the script is not manipulating or

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.150
accessing the DOM or CSSOM, then I could

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.590
add an async attribute, which would unblock DOM construction.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.700
&gt;&gt; Yep. That's awesome.
