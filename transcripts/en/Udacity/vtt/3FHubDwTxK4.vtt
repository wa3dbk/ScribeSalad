00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.969
&gt;&gt; We often talk about classical and operant conditioning separately. However,

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.372
they can be used together to change behavior. A perfect example of this is the

00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:13.052
story of Callie the sea lion. Let's go talk to Dr Zeligs about this. She can

00:00:13.052 --> 00:00:13.635
tell us more.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:18.635
&gt;&gt; Callie's back story is both heartbreaking and inspirational. So, she's the

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:23.679
youngest of my group, and she is, I believe, eight years old at this point. She

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.711
was one of the youngest surviving premature baby sea lions that has ever made

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:33.035
it. She was born more than one month premature. And her mother died of demolic

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:37.768
acid poisoning. Which is a type of toxic algae, it's a neuro toxin. Callie was

00:00:37.768 --> 00:00:41.872
exposed to that toxin in utero, and has a huge range of neurologic and

00:00:41.872 --> 00:00:46.624
gastrointestinal problems as a result of this exposure, so it's been touch and

00:00:46.624 --> 00:00:51.160
go her whole life and one of her big problems is because of this really sort of

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.208
form of brain damage, she doesn't like food. So her natural instinct is to

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:03.433
starve herself and we have had to use classical conditioning actually to keep

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:07.593
her alive, because what she does like is behavior and people, because how she

00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:13.932
was raised. So we used behavior and people to reward her for eating, which is

00:01:13.932 --> 00:01:17.962
the opposite of what you normally think, but it's a great testimony to what

00:01:17.962 --> 00:01:24.785
classical and operant conditioning can do, and today she's alive and healthy.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.855
&gt;&gt; So learning saved her life.

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:27.163
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:27.163 --> 00:01:29.979
Learning saved her life and, and she has learned to like fish.
