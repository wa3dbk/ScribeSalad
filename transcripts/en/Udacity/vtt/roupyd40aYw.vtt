00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.210
Now that we have those two classes
in place, the last step to getting

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.880
the core data structure set up
is creating our managed objects.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.140
Creating our managed objects is
actually easier than you might think.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.810
Because, in fact,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.020
we did most of the work already
when we created our model file.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.790
Now, all we need to do in order to
generate our managed object files

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.910
is click on our data model,
click editor and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.640
then click
Create NSManagedObject Subclass.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.400
&gt;From here we select the model file we'd
like to create entity classes from and

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.770
then the entities or
objects we would like to be managed.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.190
Here will select both Note and Notebook
because we want to manage both of them.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.810
And then we'll click Next.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.050
And then Create, cool,
and here they are taddah.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.160
But wait a minute,
how come there are four files here?

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.650
So when you generate
these managed classes

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.410
two files are actually created for
each entity.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.920
You have a class file and
you have an extension.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.840
The extension file contains code that
matches up with your object model.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.700
You never ever want to write anything
into these extensions because Xcode

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.180
will overwrite them and recreate
the class if you modify the model.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.900
So, it's good to write any code inside
of the managed object class itself.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.630
Now let's just move these down to
the model folder where they belong and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.150
feel free to pause the video here and

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.720
go ahead and generate these managed
object classes on your own.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.170
Great, so,
this Note class is looking pretty bare.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.480
What we need to do now is that add
an init method to this class can create

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.480
usable instances of itself.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.340
We'll add in a convenience init which
takes text, a string with the words new

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.960
Note init and an NSManagedObject
context called, Context.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.330
Then, what we need to do is
create an NSEntityDescription.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.930
An entity description is an object that
has access to all the information we

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.290
provided in the entity
part of the model.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.890
And it's needed in order to
instantiate any managed object class.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.920
&gt;From the entity description,
we call entity for name.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.030
Which takes in the name of the entity,
so in this case, Note, and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.730
the context in which we want the Note to
live, in managed object context context.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.780
Then we can call the designated
initializer, which is the initializer

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.210
for NSManagedObject, the superclass,
which takes in the entity description

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.480
and the context in order
to create a new instance.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.600
And you can see the parameter name says,
insertIntoManagedObjectContext,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.490
which is where the instance will live.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.740
Remember that every single core data
object needs to know its context.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.220
Lastly, we just initialize
some properties,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.460
text will equal text which we
can remember is the new note.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.640
And creation date will get
initialized to NSDate object

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.490
which is just the current date.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.790
We'll put in this fatal error
in case no entity exists and

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.050
the entity name we're passing in.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.610
And we're done.

00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:50.601
I'm also just going to add in this
variable which is just a formatted

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:54.235
version of that CreationDate
property we initialized up there.

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:56.055
It just makes the date
more human readable.

00:02:58.855 --> 00:03:00.265
And that's it.

00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:03.435
We can now just do the same thing for
the Notebook class.

00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:06.030
Awesome, why don't you give it a try?

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.960
Before moving ahead to the next video
make sure you have both inits and

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.960
get no warnings.
