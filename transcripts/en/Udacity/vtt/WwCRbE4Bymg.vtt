00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.680
If we were talking about using the viter, visitor pattern inside a compiler,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.680
then the concrete visitors might one might do type checking,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.700
one might do pre-printing, and so on.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.590
And, the concrete elements might correspond to

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.200
things like assignment statements, or declarations, or other parts of the Code.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.100
The object structure class, itself, represents the parse tree as a whole, and

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.610
is your starting point for doing the navigation through the structure.
