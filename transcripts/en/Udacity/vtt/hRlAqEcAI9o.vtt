00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.765
But this loss of protection with the

00:00:02.765 --> 00:00:05.870
Dos-like structure is simply unacceptable for a

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.460
general purpose operating system today. On the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.310
other hand, the monolithic structure gives the protection

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.222
that is so important. At the same time, what it strives to do is also

00:00:17.222 --> 00:00:20.440
(no period) It reduces the potential for

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.650
performance loss by consolidating all the services in

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.750
one big monolithic structure. That is, even

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.170
tough and application has to go from its

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.150
address space, into the operating system's address

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.330
space in order to get some service, It

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.410
is usually the case that the operating

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.980
system has several components and they have to

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.300
talk to one another in order to provide

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.180
the service that an application wants. Think about

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.050
the file system, for instance. You make a call

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.740
to the file system to open a file and the

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.430
file system then may have to call the storage module

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.320
in order to find out where exactly a file is

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.000
residing. And it may have to contact The memory

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.160
manager module to see where it wants to bring in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.700
the file that you want to open and see the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.270
content of. So in this sense there's infraction that's going to

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.820
go on under the cover. Inside the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.130
operating system between components of the operating

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.890
system. In order to satisfy a single

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.120
service call from an application. So this monolithic

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.760
structure insures that even though... We have to go from an application into the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.960
operating system's address space. Once you're inside

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.560
the operating system's address space, then potential for

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.320
performance loss is avoided by the consolidation

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.890
of all the components that comprise the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.340
operating system. But what is lost in

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.570
the monolithic structure (no period) That is the

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.430
ability to customize the operating system service

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.710
for different applications. This model of one

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.240
size fits all, so far the system

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.790
service is concerned with the monolithic structure shutsoed

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.090
the opportunity for customizing the operating service

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.890
for the needs of different applications. Now,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.350
you may wonder why do we need

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.170
to customize the operating system service for different

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.880
applications? Why not one size fits all? Why is there an issue? If you look

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.710
at a couple of examples, the need

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.880
for customization will become fairly obvious. For example,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.520
Interactive video games. The requirement of applications,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.020
that are providing a video game experience

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.470
for the user. Or consider another application,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.290
which is computing, All the prime numbers. You

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.330
can immediately see that the operating system

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.980
needs for these two classes of applications

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.060
are perhaps very different. On the one hand, for the little kid who is playing

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.520
a video game, the key determinant of

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.560
a good operating system would be responsiveness. How

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.890
quickly the operating system is responding to his

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.650
nifty moves when he plays his video game.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.550
On the other hand, for the programmer

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.180
that wrote this prime number computing application, the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.340
key determinant of performance is going to be sustained

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.780
CPU time that's available for crunching his application.
