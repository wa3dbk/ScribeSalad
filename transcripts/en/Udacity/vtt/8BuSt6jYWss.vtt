00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.290
In the first case when we used the local implementation and used only the remote

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.430
interface. The implement that makes instances of

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.400
the object remotely accessible. So the heavy lifting

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.830
needs to be done by the implementer.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.410
That's not quite preferable. One virtue of the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.260
local implementation is that the service provider can

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.860
make selected servers visible to the selected clients.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.730
So that's the only virtue that one can

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.860
associate with the first implementation that uses local. You

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.680
cannot make a hard case, a strong case

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.030
for this choice. So this choice where we are

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.130
extending remote object and the remote server. We

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.920
are letting Java RMI do all the heavy lifting

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.530
to make the server object visible to the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.020
network lines. And that's the more preferred way of

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.330
building a network service, and making it available for clients anywhere.
