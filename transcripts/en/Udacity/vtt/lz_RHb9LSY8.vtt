In addition to ECT, repetitive, transcranial, magnetic stimulation is another

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:10.011
form of treatment for treating severe depression. And this involves exposing

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:13.602
specific parts of the brain to bursts of high-intensity magnetic fields as

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:18.834
opposed to electricity. Again, this treatment is only used as a last resort

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:23.944
when a person did not respond positively to other forms of treatment. Some of

00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:28.078
the side effects can include a mild headache or brief light-headedness. In

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:31.642
addition, the person's scalp, face, and jaw may contract and tingle during the

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:33.020
procedure.
