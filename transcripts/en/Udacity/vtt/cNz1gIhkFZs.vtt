00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The first environment, the one we start with, is special.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We call it the global environment.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
By default everyone gets a chance to see it.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Whenever we make a function call, we make a new environment

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that officially has a parent.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This environment knows that it was created in, defined in this global environment.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So when we're interpreting JavaScript, we're going to use

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
this nested, or chained, notion of environments to keep track of

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the values of variables.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
An environment is just a mapping from variable names to values

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
except environments may also have parent pointers.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Every environment that's not the global one has a parent.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Beyond having a parent pointer, environments just map variables to values.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
B is 555. X is 2.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
To give you another way to think about this notion of chained environments,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we're going to reason by an analogy.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Let's say that you're going on vacation.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You leave your home and you go to stay at a hotel by the seashore.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You don't bring everything in your home with you,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but you bring a few things.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And then eventually you're going to leave your hotel room and go out on the beach.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Maybe you'll bring your swimming suit, pack a lunch, that sort of thing.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You'll bring a few items with you, but not everything that was in your hotel room

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and certainly not everything that was in your home.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now let's say that you've forgotten your keys. Oh my gosh!

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Where are they?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The first place to check might be in your pocket or around with you on the beach.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Did I bring them all the way to the beach?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If not, maybe they're back at the hotel.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
If they're not back in the hotel, maybe you left them at home.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And if they're not at home, there isn't a whole lot of recourse.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Maybe you can call a locksmith or do something else sort of generically.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Hopefully you can get new keys.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But ultimately, there is just nowhere else to check.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So this is analogous of having a global environment--a big marketplace

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
where you could buy new keys.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And then some nested environments on top of it--

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
your home, your hotel, whatever you brought with you to the beach.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So let's test our knowledge of this idyllic tropic scene with a quiz.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Suppose you are currently in the hotel environment.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We have A is 6 and B is 7.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That points back to the home environment, where A is 44 and X is 55.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And that points all the way to the global environment, where A is 1, B is 2, and C is 3.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You're in the hotel, and you want to evaluate A, B, C, and X.

00:02:15.000 --> 09:59:59.000
What are the values of these variables? Fill in the blanks.
