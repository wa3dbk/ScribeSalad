00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.430
So let's look at what a network on chip

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.760
might look like. Let's say we have some sort

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.630
of a squarish style, that has a core, and

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.520
maybe a level one cache. And such styles normally will

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.110
be connected to a shared bus. Now let's say

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.630
that these four cores are using half of the available

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.530
tuples on the bus. Because their cache misses and

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.110
coherence need to be taken care of through the bus.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.770
Now let's say we had another set of

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.860
those cores pretty much the same thing just replicated.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.764
Now we have an even longer thus possibly

00:00:32.764 --> 00:00:36.108
a slower bus, that all traffic from all these

00:00:36.108 --> 00:00:38.570
eight cores goes to. So we got a

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.980
slower bus probably with less throughput than the original

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.600
small one had, yet it has twice the demand

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.810
for traffic. So very quickly, it will get saturated.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.170
Now, let's consider a type of on chip network that is called a mesh.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.730
So here, what we have is this quartiles are individually

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.280
connected like this, for example. Now there is no more broadcast, but

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.270
this core can still send the message to any

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.140
other core. If we send the message to this,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.600
this the link that gets used. Meanwhile, this core

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.890
could be sending a message here. If we need to

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.073
send a message from here to here, then these

00:01:17.073 --> 00:01:20.570
two links get used. Meanwhile, we can get these two

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.023
links used independently. So as you can see, the total

00:01:24.023 --> 00:01:27.857
available throughput in the entire network is several times the

00:01:27.857 --> 00:01:31.382
throughput of this individual link. And because it's a

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:34.547
short link we can have a very large throughput. Now

00:01:34.547 --> 00:01:37.573
I'm going to take this two by two mesh and

00:01:37.573 --> 00:01:40.243
copy it so that I get four of those and

00:01:40.243 --> 00:01:46.760
create a four by four mesh that now supports 16 cores, twice as many as here.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.041
Note how many new links are there. Now

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:53.176
if you have neighbor-to-neighbor communication, we can have

00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:55.570
these two talking, these two talking, these two

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.130
talking all over independent links. So as I

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.100
increase the number of cores, I also increase

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.270
the number of these links, naturally. So that the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.240
total throughput available in this network grows with

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.154
the number of cores. So the number of cores

00:02:11.154 --> 00:02:14.040
grows, the number of links grows, and that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.784
allows the available throughput to grow, and that means

00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:22.870
that I can have many more cores than I could on the bus. There many of types

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.850
of these so-called point to point networks. A mesh

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.480
is one of those that is very good for

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.810
chip building because none of these links

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.727
intersect each other. So because chips are

00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:39.567
basically made by printing things on silicon,

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:42.336
it's naturally good to have something that is

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:48.580
kind of flat like this, and doesn't have links going across different nodes. But

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.490
we can build chips with some amount of links crossing each other and thus we can

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.480
have a mesh which is kind of like what

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.420
we have seen. We can have a torus network.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.950
You build the torus by taking the mesh and

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.900
connecting the end points to each other so the

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.990
torus really takes the link and kind of wraps

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.970
it around and then wraps it around and so

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.020
on. And then you do that in the other

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.156
dimension too. You can think of these processors as basically

00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:25.290
things on a donut. You would take this wrap it around,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.112
you get a cylinder. Then you take the end points of the

00:03:28.112 --> 00:03:30.704
cylinder, bend it and create a donut so that's why it's

00:03:30.704 --> 00:03:34.080
called a taurus. But in reality what you really do. Is you

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.580
do this, have a long link that crosses here, and a

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.860
long link that crosses here, and so on. And then you also

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.320
take this and create a long link that goes here, so

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.568
that's how you create a taurus. And then there are even fancier

00:03:46.568 --> 00:03:49.277
networks that are still reasonably good for on chip

00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:53.785
implementation, such as flattened butterfly. If you're interested in

00:03:53.785 --> 00:03:56.060
how these work, a very good place to start

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.050
would be an advanced class on on chip interconnects.
