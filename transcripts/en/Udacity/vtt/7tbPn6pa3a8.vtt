00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.774
Right now, we have two separate statements about the values that x is allowed to

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:07.610
equal. But looking at our number line, there's only one area of the number line

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.324
shaded in. [unknown] then, it would seem that we could write this as a sort of

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:15.446
connected inequality, combining these two inequalities together. So, how would

00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:18.868
you guess that we could write this as, what I'm going to call, a chained

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:23.878
inequality? Insert the inequality symbols that you think belong in this two

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:24.388
boxes.
