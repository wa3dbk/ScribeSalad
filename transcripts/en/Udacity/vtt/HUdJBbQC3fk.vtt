Another helpful activity
is one big idea.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.160
This activity involves taking a few of
the smaller ideas from the crazy 8s or

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.530
the more popular ones
that were voted on, and

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.790
going into more detail about one
unifying design for the product.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.460
All right, it's your turn again.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.230
Set a timer for five minutes and

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.290
sketch out one the ideas from
the crazy 8s in more detail.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.180
You can use one of the ideas that we
provided or one from your own work.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.380
Share your sketch in
the discussion forums, and

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.250
