00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's say it's election day coming up again.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this example, I would like you to get an intuition how confidence intervals behave.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here's again all the voters and there are multiple institutions.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Institution 1, Institution 2,  and Institution 3 that all samp of the voters

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to derive a prediction of what the outcome of election day is.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
For simplicity, there are only 2 parties A and B and say institution 1

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
finds in a sample of 20 with 11 say A and 9 say B.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
What do you think the maximum of your estimate is going to be base on the information?

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I'm asking here for the probability that party A wins.
