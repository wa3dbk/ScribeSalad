00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is my answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I found all the first letters, which are the first letter of a word

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
where there is at least one other letter, because it's okay to have a zero by itself.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You just can't have a zero followed by another digit.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I found all those first letters, and then for each first letter

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I added in a letter not equal to zero, conjoined them all with and and put that into the body.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Here's an example. For YOU equals ME-squared,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I have lambda with the variables just like before

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and this result just like before, but I've added in Y not equal 0 and N not equal 0

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and the old value.
