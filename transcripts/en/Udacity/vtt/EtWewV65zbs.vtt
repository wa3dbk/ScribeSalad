00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.943
To do this, all we do is add the frequencies in each country belonging to the

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:12.128
different continents. There are 2 students from Canada, 3 from Mexico and 10

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.943
from the US. So if we add them, we get 15 students from North America. And

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:26.058
similarly, 4% are from Canada, 6% from Mexico and 20% from the US. So if we add

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.276
them, we get 30%. We have 12 students from China, 8 from India, 8 from Japan and

00:00:33.288 --> 00:00:40.295
1 from Pakistan. So if we add them, we get 29 students from Asia. 24 plus 16

00:00:40.502 --> 00:00:51.360
plus 16 plus 2 is 58. And finally, we have 2 from England, 3 from Germany and 1

00:00:51.372 --> 00:01:01.009
from Sweden, making 6 from Europe. 4% plus 6% plus 2% is 12%. So now we have

00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:05.379
even more simplified data. While this is interesting and provides new

00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:10.190
information, now we can't know how many people are from individual countries

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:14.956
just by looking at this table. Creating this table was convienent because it

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:20.090
gave us fewer categories to look at. Three categories in this case. But we lost

00:01:20.102 --> 00:01:24.721
information in the process. In other words, information about specific

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:30.016
countries. When creating frequency distribution tables, there can sometimes be a

00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:35.169
trade off between convenience and informativeness. But there's no one right way

00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:39.913
of presenting the data. It all depends on what kind of question you want to

00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:44.418
answer. In this case, if you want to know how many students are from North

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.923
America, organizing it like this is best. But if you want to know how many

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:53.922
students are from India, or other specific countries, organizing it like this is

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:58.588
best. The key is to know how you're going to organize your data, based on the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.642
questions that you want to answer.
