So, here's my code for doing this. The key part is using pickle.load reading

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.056
from the file. We're going to use a with, so we don't have to remember to close

00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:14.020
the file. Reading that file as fin, and that's the file we'll load from, and

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.140
we'll put the whole thing in a try block, so if it fails, we'll re-crawl the web

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.123
the slow way.
