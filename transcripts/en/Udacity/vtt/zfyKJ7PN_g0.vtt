00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.790
Hello, and welcome to this unit on file systems. We'll talk about

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.300
what a file system is, about how application developers interact with it,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.890
and then see what an OS is doing behind the scenes and

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.010
discuss some common optimizations that make

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.460
file systems faster. I hope you enjoy.
