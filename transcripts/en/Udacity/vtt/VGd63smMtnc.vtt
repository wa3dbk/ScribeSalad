Kind: captions
Language: en

00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.110
Here in the presentPreview method you
can see that once we have the caption,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.570
we need to recreate the GIF
following these steps.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.480
Here in this line we recreate
a new instance of Regift.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.730
After that, we create a new
GIF including the caption and

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.270
save it to a URL variable.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.570
With the URL to the newGif,
we create an instance of the GIF class.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.690
Then we assign that instance of the GIF
class to the preview view controllers

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.260
GIF property and

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.020
push the preview ViewController
onto the navigation stack.
