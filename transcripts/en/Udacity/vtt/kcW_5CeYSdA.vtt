00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.330
Okay. Now, we need to do some work

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.800
in the OfyService class, which is in the service

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.230
package. When you use Objectify to define an

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.860
entity class, you need to register the entity class.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.140
You do this in the static method in

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.340
OfyService. See here, this is where we registered the

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.090
profile class. But you're going to need to go ahead,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.010
and add the code to register the conference class.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.790
You'll probably find that when you do that, you get an error. But the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.280
error is quite simply because we don't have the right import, so go ahead and

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.940
import the conference class. And that's all

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.710
you have to do to register your entity.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.970
Go ahead and pause the video for

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.430
a minute, while you register the conference class.
