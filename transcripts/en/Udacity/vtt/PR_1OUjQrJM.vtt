00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
Now, if the image of complexity classes that are just true look a bit complicated to you,

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.090
I would have to say you haven't seen anything yet,

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.370
because, of course, they are many many more complexity classes out there.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.050
Basically, any type of machine and restriction that you can think of forms a complexity class.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.290
And a nice collection of this, if you're interested in that, is the complexity zoo

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.890
initiated by Scott Aaronson, a theoretical computer scientist at the MIT,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.190
and here we have a nice formatting of this document as a PDF, but it is also a website.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.270
So Google the complexity zoo. It's really interesting to see.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.090
And as you can see here in the glossary, there are many many many more complexity classes

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.050
than ones that we talked about.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.140
So let's just see if we can find those that we already know.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.020
Here's FPT. This is the class of fixed-parameter tractable problems. Here is P.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.130
Down here somewhere is NP, but you see it's already difficult to find

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.010
even those classes that we know, because they are so many different other ones.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.300
And they have lots of different origins, so there are some classes that are related to approximation,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.940
some classes that are related to randomization, and many classes here are also

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.920
related to special models of computation that we haven't had the time to cover in this course.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.120
So there are some models of computation that work with circuits for example

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.970
or even more exotic models such as quantum computing.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.260
The bad news about all of these classes here or all of the classes here in this document is that

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.150
we don't really know much about the relationships between them.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.050
We know some, but as you have seen with P versus NP, there are lots of open questions here,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.190
which I think is also a good news for you.

00:01:33.190 --> 99:59:59.000
There are still lots and lots and lots of things to explore in computational complexity.
