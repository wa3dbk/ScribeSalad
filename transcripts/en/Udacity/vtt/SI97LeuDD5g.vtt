00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's go try it out together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
When we're in chart state 0, when we haven't seen any of the input yet,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we started in position 0. there is no hidden input we're missing.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
There is no processing that we've already done.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Even as we move initially into this first state in chart position 1,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we've seen one token, and look, there's one token to the left of this dot.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We got here by reading in the input, left parenthesis, from chart position 0.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Oh, we were expecting a left parenthesis. Great. I just move my finger over to the right.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Essentially, I copy this previous rule, P goes to dot open P close starting at 0,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and I bring it down here into chart 1.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But now I have the dot, I have my finger, before P.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If I'm expecting to see a P in the future, I could see another open parentheses,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
because that's one of the things that P can rewrite to.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I could also see nothing, because that's another thing that P could be rewritten to.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I've included both of those--they're right here--one, two--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
based on this rule and this P--one, two.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Brought those two in.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I brought them in based on thinking hard about chart one,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and they assume that I've already seen this left parenthesis.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
These two rules start at position 1.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Since one of the things I'm considering is that P is totally empty,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
up here I was thinking, oh, I could've seen a left parenthesis

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and been expecting a P and then a right parenthesis, but if P disappears

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
then I'm already past it, and I'm expecting a right parenthesis.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I got this from this rule up here, which came from chart position 0.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now, we just so happen to know what the actual next piece of input was.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We saw an open parenthesis and then another open parenthesis.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It must've been that we were looking at this very special rule right here.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We saw the open parenthesis and this one was right, and all of the others were wrong.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
They were possibilities, but they didn't pan out.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We took this rule here and move our finger over, shift it past this open parenthesis,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
so we get open parenthesis dot P close. That's right where we started here.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It is bringing over this rule that had previously said starting at 1 it still says starting at 1,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
but now I do the trick and this is the part where the numbers change.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
If my dot is right in front of a P, then I could be expecting to see a left parenthesis,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
we're not going to in the input, but you never know, or nothing.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Once again, based on this P, I'm going to start bringing in rules 1 and 2.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
P goes to dot open P close. P goes to nothing.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But this time we started in position 2.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
This was a very tricky quiz. You should not feel bad if elements of this gave you grief.

00:02:54.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We're going to go over this in much more detail later on.
