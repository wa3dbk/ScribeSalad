00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.575
So, as we talked about in our example
before, we need to use the distributive

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:08.328
property here to figure out how this minus
sign affects all of the terms inside the

00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:12.632
second set of parentheses. First off
though, since nothing is happening outside

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:15.778
of the parentheses, on the front end at
least, for this first part of our

00:00:15.778 --> 00:00:18.775
expression, we're just going to rewrite
that without the parentheses. And then, we

00:00:18.775 --> 00:00:23.216
remember the trick that we talked about
before that a minus sign actually means

00:00:23.228 --> 00:00:29.019
plus -1 times whatever you want
to subtract. So instead of the minus sign

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.765
right here, that's what I am going to
write, we're adding -1 times

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:37.554
this entire thing in parentheses. And now,
we need to use the distributive property

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:42.177
to multiply -1 by every term in
here, this is going to affect the 4x^2 and

00:00:42.177 --> 00:00:48.319
the -2x and also the 4. So, going one
step further, you'll notice that for right

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.512
now, I've let there be an addition sign
between all of the terms over here, and

00:00:52.512 --> 00:00:56.114
then their sign is being determined
within the term before I change any of

00:00:56.114 --> 00:00:59.399
these to subtraction signs if they're
going to be them eventually. So, now we

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.586
can carry out the simplification within
each term. Remember that if you have two

00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:08.772
negative numbers multiplied together, they
equal a positive number. So, -1 times -2 is

00:01:08.784 --> 00:01:12.526
actually equal to positive 2. And now,
since we have two terms where I'm adding a

00:01:12.526 --> 00:01:17.168
negative, I'm going to switch these to
negative signs or minus signs. And then,

00:01:17.168 --> 00:01:21.760
last but not least, we rearrange and
combine like terms. So our final answer is

00:01:21.775 --> 00:01:27.225
3x^2+4x-3.
Awesome job. There are a ton of steps as

00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:31.204
you can see in this problem, and there are
a lot of places where it's really easy to

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:35.123
make a silly mistake, so that's why it's
super important that we write every single

00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:38.735
step down. I know this probably feels
really tedious, but, in the end, as you

00:01:38.747 --> 00:01:42.502
keep practicing getting more proficient,
it's going to be the thing that gives you

00:01:42.514 --> 00:01:46.191
the right answers. So please just keep
taking the time to write out all of your

00:01:46.203 --> 00:01:48.524
steps and don't take any shortcuts quite
yet.
