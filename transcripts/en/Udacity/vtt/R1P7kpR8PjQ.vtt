00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.470
So now that we've, we've got together all the criteria, and the, first order

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.120
logic expression of things, let's go back to Property 2 for a moment.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.830
That requirement that the concrete implementation is consistent.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.390
Recall that this means that all operations preserve invariants.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.130
The relat, relevant invariant is that running total reflects the sum of

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.460
the transactions that have taken place.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.410
So we have to make sure that each of the operations if that

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.509
invariant is true before hand, it's also we true, it is also true afterwards.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.630
So the balance operation is not a problem because it doesn't effect the value if

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.560
the variables.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.540
For the other two we would need an inductive argument that the invariant is

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.300
initially true and that deposits and withdrawals keep it true.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.740
This intern relies on the fact that the sum operation can be defined in terms of

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.730
re, repeated additions and subtractions.
