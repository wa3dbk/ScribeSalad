00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:03.530
So we have seen some relatively
general fault tolerance techniques.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.338
Now let's look at the fault tolerance
techniques for memory and storage.

00:00:07.338 --> 00:00:12.593
We could use dual modular redundancy or
triple modular redundancy for memory and

00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:17.090
storage, but they are considered
to be overkill for these devices.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.456
We can get better techniques that
protect us from similar problems.

00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:26.054
So dual modular redundancy and triple
modular redundancy are typically used

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:30.298
for the hardware that does the
computation, which cannot be protected

00:00:30.298 --> 00:00:33.622
by some of the less expensive
techniques that memory and

00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:37.229
storage can benefit from and
these techniques for memory and

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:41.076
storage are called error detection or
error correction codes.

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:46.554
So the idea is that we can store bits
with some x-ray information that allows

00:00:46.554 --> 00:00:52.221
us to detect and, or correct one or more
bits of error, depending on the code.

00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:56.345
So we don't have to store everything
twice or everything three times in

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:59.860
order to receive detection or
correction of a single error.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.224
The simplest technique that is often
used for memory storage is parity.

00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:09.445
With parity, we add one extra bit to
the data bits and that extra bit,

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:13.420
you can compute simply as
an XOR of all the data bits.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.132
When we do have parity,
if a fault flips any one of the bits,

00:01:17.132 --> 00:01:18.853
including the parity bit.

00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:21.686
The parity bit will no
longer match the data.

00:01:21.686 --> 00:01:26.321
By flipping one of the bits,
we are changing the result of this XOR

00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:29.534
to be the opposite of
what it previously was.

00:01:29.534 --> 00:01:31.899
So when we read the data
in the parity and

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.268
we see that now the parity
does not match data, we assume

00:01:35.268 --> 00:01:40.220
that there has been a bit flip and
that's how we detect a single bit error.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.139
The next level of error detection and
correction codes is the so-called ECC,

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:47.761
which stands for error correction code.

00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:53.750
And a typical example of this would be
a type of code called SECDED codes or

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.674
single error correction and
double error detection code.

00:01:58.674 --> 00:02:03.324
So this code can detect any one
bit flip and actually fix it or

00:02:03.324 --> 00:02:08.346
if there are 2 bit flips,
we will found out that that happened,

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:11.700
but we can no longer
fix it using this code.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.132
An example of where this type
of a code is used is in data

00:02:16.132 --> 00:02:18.108
modules that have ECC.

00:02:18.108 --> 00:02:19.966
This is how they are protected.

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:22.573
So pretty much if there is a single
bit flip in such a module,

00:02:22.573 --> 00:02:23.681
you don't even notice.

00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:25.097
Everything functions well.

00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:29.493
If there are two errors in the data that
is protected by the same code, then we

00:02:29.493 --> 00:02:34.166
will get notified that there's been an
error, but we cannot continue operating

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:38.588
normally, because actually we cannot
correct the error in this state anymore.

00:02:38.588 --> 00:02:41.268
Hard drives use even fancier codes,

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:46.203
such as the Reed-Solomon codes,
that I'm not going to go into here.

00:02:46.203 --> 00:02:50.144
And these codes can detect and
correct multiple bit errors and

00:02:50.144 --> 00:02:54.540
they're especially powerful when
we have a streak of flipped bits,

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.044
which happens, for example,
when the head oscillates a little bit.

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:01.720
And while the disk is spinning it for
a while,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.140
just is too high above the platter and
misses some of the bits.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.270
And then for hard drives in addition
to these error detection and correction

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.530
codes, there is a family of techniques
called RAID that we will look at next.
