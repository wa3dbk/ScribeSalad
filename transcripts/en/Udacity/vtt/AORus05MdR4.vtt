00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.978
For the first one, we plug in negative 2 for x. The quantity negative 2 squared

00:00:04.978 --> 00:00:10.114
is 4. And 5 times negative 2 is negative 10. These numbers sum to negative 6.

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:14.158
And these numbers sum to 0. For this check, we have the quantity negative 3

00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:20.624
squared. Plus 5 times negative 3 plus 6 equals 0. The square of negative 3 is 9,

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:26.196
and 5 times negative 3 is negative 15. These numbers sum to negative 6 and these

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:27.376
numbers sum to 0.
