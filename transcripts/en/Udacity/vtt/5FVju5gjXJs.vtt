00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.680
The cardiovascular system is comprised of our heart and all of the blood

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.587
vessels in our body. Now, unfortunately, the cardiovascular system is

00:00:08.587 --> 00:00:13.976
especially susceptible to the effects of sustained arousal. Under the

00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:18.130
conditions of sustained arousal, our heart rate and blood pressure elevate and

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.898
remain elevated over a period of time. This can damage arteries. And increase

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:28.880
the likelihood of fatty buildup. This in turn can result in heart disease.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.378
Again, this demonstrates just how important it is to reduce stress in our daily

00:00:32.378 --> 00:00:36.728
lives. Because of its negative consequences on the immune system, as well as

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:40.360
the poteential damage to our cardiovascular health.
