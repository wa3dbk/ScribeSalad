00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.010
Here is why the movie quote is still playing.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.520
Thus far in RecordSoundsViewController,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.950
we have a function called audioRecorderDidFinishRecording.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.570
And inside this function, what we are doing is saving the recordedAudio.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.010
By the way, we are tracking two things about the audio.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.520
Its file path and its title.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.990
Now, even though we are saving the recorded audio,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.530
we're not quite passing it from the first scene to the second.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.840
If you want to play the sounds in the second U controller,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.470
we need to pass this data to the second scene.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.750
Let's do that next.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.880
Now to do this, I will go back to RecordSoundsViewController and

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.570
introduce you to another function that we inherit from UIViewController.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.220
It's called prepareForSegue.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.980
And as I start to type it, Xcode autocompletes it for me.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.500
This function, prepareForSegue, it gets called just before a segue is about to

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.990
be performed and therefore is a great place to pass any data.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.520
In here, I will add an if statement and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.230
check to see if my segue identifier is stopRecording.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.280
Now this type of a check becomes really important when we

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.590
have multiple segues connected to the same ViewController.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.890
All right, to pass data to this second ViewController,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.850
we somehow need a way to access it in code.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.000
And I can do that with this line.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.050
Here I created a constant called playSoundsVC, and then defined its

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.880
appropriate type, and then used segue's destinationViewController property

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.660
to get a handle on the second ViewController in our app.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.020
I also use the as keyword in Swift to convert this destinationViewController to

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.570
the correct type we are expecting, which is PlaySoundsViewController.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.280
Okay, so now that we have a way to access playSoundsViewController in code,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.420
let's think about how we are going to pass data to it.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.970
We can get our data from this sender parameter.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.360
Remember that sender is the object that initiated the segue,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.210
which in our case was recordedAudio.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.880
So I can write a line of code like this to retrieve the data.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.280
So now I just need to pass this data to playSoundsViewController.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.700
But wait, this guy, playSoundsViewController,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.620
it doesn't really have a way of receiving any data just yet, does it?

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.070
So to fix this, what I will do is go to playSoundsViewController from

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.890
the navigator, and create a new variable called receivedAudio.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.590
Now this variable is of type, RecordedAudio.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.050
This was the new class we created.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.140
Now if you go back to prepareForSegue, I can pass the data in this manner.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.650
I can say playSoundsViewController.receivedAudio.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.710
This is the new variable we created in playSoundsViewController.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.310
This is now equal to data.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.530
Cool, let's run this project.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.120
All right, let me record something.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.390
Is the app working now?

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.830
Let me play the sound.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.110
&gt;&gt; My momma always said life was like a box of chocolates.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.790
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.970
The app is still playing a movie quote.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.980
Care to guess why that is happening?
