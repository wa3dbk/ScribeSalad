00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.205
It means that there's only one x-intercept. To see this in action, let's take a

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:10.252
look at the graph of the problem that we were looking at on the last quiz. So,

00:00:10.252 --> 00:00:15.352
here's the graph of y equals 4x squared plus 4x plus 1. We found before that the

00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:19.368
root of this was negative 1 half. And we can see that the x -intercept is at

00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:24.150
negative 1 half, 0, just like we would expect. This parabola is special and that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.568
instead of crossing the x-axis going down and then crossing again, in other

00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:35.158
words, having 2 x-intercepts, it simply touches the x-axis at a single point,

00:00:35.158 --> 00:00:40.329
which is its x-intercept. Another example of a parabola that does this is the

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.059
basic one, the parent graph, y equals x squared. You can imagine if we shifted

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.004
this over and made a little bit wider, we would get back to this graph.
