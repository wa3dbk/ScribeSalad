00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To solve this, let us sort the house prices by their increasing numbers--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:15.000
110K, 125, 148, 160, 180, 325, all the way up to 2400--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and that makes it obvious the one in the middle is 160K.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So $160,000 is the median house price.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If you look at this neighborhood again,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I would say the 160K is a really good characterization of the typical house price

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you find in this neighborhood.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's much, much, much more reasonable

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
than the nearly 500K that the mean would provide us.
