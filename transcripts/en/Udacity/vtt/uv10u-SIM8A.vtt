00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.120
So that was opening.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.550
You erode, and then you dilate.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.580
Well, some of us come from
the other side of the tracks.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.030
We like to dilate, and then erode.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.310
Same thing was eh, again using
the same structuring element.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.190
So, using the same words from before,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.640
you can show that closing of A by B,
all right?

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.350
Is, it says it's the complement of
the union of all translations of B

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.960
that don't overlap A, well that's
much better shown in a picture.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.620
Right?

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.509
So now we take our paintbrush B and
we run it on the outside of A,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.700
where we're not allowed to go touch,
go inside of, of that and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.720
what results is the new area that
is that, that, that's been painted.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.830
And one of the things that's
interesting to see is,

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.720
you see how this notch is smoothed out.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.140
But because of the convexity of this and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.940
the ve, I can actually move
this around very precisely,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.820
right around that, so this is,
these external corners are preserved.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.780
Okay, so it, it,
it fills up sort of concave corners, but

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.010
it, it remains,
it keeps convex ones there.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.580
So, again,
if I run that brush over and over and

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.200
over again, I'm going to get the same
painting that I got before, and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.030
again it's idempotent or
idempotent, pick your favorite.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.700
Okay?
The repeated operation has no effect.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.960
So, here's an example of doing closing.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.290
Take an image,
threshold it, close it, and

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.390
you get, but you might say it's a pretty
reasonable outline of the boundary.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.990
You notice,
it did catch some of the shadow

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.930
well that's because your threshold
pulled up some of the shadow.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.390
So again, you know,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.450
it's effective in a variety of ways
of sort of cleaning things up.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.280
It's not like that it give you
sort of perfect image processing.
