00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.330
R plus 6 s divided by r plus s is correct. That's some amazing work with

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.430
rationals if you're getting it right. You might have been stumped on how to

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.792
factor one of these. If so, watch me do the first one, and then see if you can

00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:15.980
finish tackling this problem. To divide by any fraction, including a rational

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.006
expression, we change division to multiplication and multiply by their

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:24.490
reciprocal of the first fraction. Now we want to start factoring each piece of

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.186
these fractions. I'm going to start with this first one. We know the first two

00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:35.602
terms must be r since r times r is r squared. Now we're just trying to find

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:39.139
factors of negative 12 that sum to positive 1. Since there's a 1 in front of

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:43.794
this r times s. We know that positive 4 and negative 3 multiplied together is

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:48.530
negative 12, and sum to give us positive 1, but notice that I need a negative 12

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.310
s squared for my last term. This must mean that I need a variable of s after

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.002
each of these numbers. We can quickly check this factoring by multiplying out

00:00:56.002 --> 00:01:02.270
the binomials in our head. R times r is r squared, and 4s times negative 3s is

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.482
negative 12s squared. This positive 1 r s comes from multiplying these two terms

00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:12.304
together, and adding it to the result of multiplying these two together. So we

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:18.808
have negative 3 r s plus 4 r s, which is 1 r s. For this first denominator, we

00:01:18.808 --> 00:01:23.030
want to find factors of negative 20 that sum to negative 1. For our second

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.466
fraction we want to find factors of negative 30 that sum to 1. That would be

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:32.357
positive 6 and negative 5. And then for our denominator of our second fraction

00:01:32.357 --> 00:01:36.704
we want to find factors of negative 3 that sum to negative 2 which are negative

00:01:36.704 --> 00:01:39.902
3 and positive 1. Now that everything's factored let's cancel our terms in the

00:01:39.902 --> 00:01:45.054
numerator and denominator. There, r minus 3 s divided by r minus 3 s equals 1.

00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:50.471
And r plus 4 s divided by r plus 4 s also equals 1. The last factor we need to

00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:56.328
cancel is r minus 5 s. And this leaves us with our final answer, r plus 6 s

00:01:56.328 --> 00:01:59.083
divided by r plus 1 s, or just s.
