00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.280
Related visually to the class model diagram is the object diagram.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.270
In fact they're the same with one major exception.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.030
Instead of mentioning classes, they mention instances.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.130
The label compartment at the top of the boxes has an underlined text line.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.480
A text line has two parts.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.750
One is the class name, just like in the class model diagram, but it also has

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.180
the name of a specific instance, and those two are separated by a colon.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.190
So for example here, we have the company class, and

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.440
in particular we have the c instance of a company class.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.450
Optic diagrams are obviously used to convey the specific use of

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.980
the classes involved in a class model diagram.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.880
As you can see, for this particular instances here,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.680
many of the attribute fields have attribute values filled in for

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.990
them, as they would be for a particular instance.
