00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.710
Alright, when doing the order of operations, I'm going to start within any

00:00:03.722 --> 00:00:07.694
parentheses I have. I need to simplify this container. So I'm going to leave the

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:11.598
3 on the outside. Now I have 4 times 2 cubed or 4 times 2 to the 3rd. I know I

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.425
have a choice. This 2 could go with multiplication or with exponents, the power.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:20.702
I know it should go with the power, because powers take priority. So I have 4

00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:24.987
times, 2 cubed is really 2 times 2 times 2, or 8 minus 20 times 2. Okay.

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:29.550
Let's keep going with simplifying this parentheses. I have 3 on the outside.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:34.246
Now, with this 8, I have a choice. It could be paired with multiplication or

00:00:34.258 --> 00:00:38.976
subtraction. I know multiplication comes first. So I'm going to have 32 minus 20

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:43.404
times 2. I do this multiplication before I do this subtraction. My parentheses

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:47.438
is getting smaller which is good. Now the next choice I have to make is with the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.229
20. Should it go with the multiplication or with subtraction? I know that

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:55.219
multiplication comes first before addition or subtraction. So I have 3 on the

00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:59.334
outside, 32 minus 40. We're almost done, 32 minus 40 I know that's negative 8 so

00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:03.343
I have 3 on the outside times negative 8. Alright if you have trouble with this

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:08.079
part here's what you can do. Remember, subtraction is the same thing as adding

00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:12.834
the opposite. I could have 32 plus negative 40. Subtracting positive 40 is the

00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:17.547
same thing as adding negative 40. When I think about these two numbers, I know

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:21.858
40 is more negative, so I'm going to have 8 more negatives than 32. So I get

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.621
negative 8. And 3 times negative 8 is negative 24. If you got negative 24, nice

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:26.914
work.
