00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.526
That was not an easy problem. Correct answer is 2ab times a minus 6b times a

00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:11.036
minus 8b. If you got it right, well done. If you didn't get it right, don't

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:15.456
worry. We're going to go through it right now. Remember the first thing that you

00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:20.175
always want to do when factoring a trinomial is to look for the GCF. And that is

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:24.900
the most common mistake that students make, is they forget to factor out the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.498
GCF. If you don't factor out the GCF first, you'll make your life a lot more

00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:34.632
difficult. Here, when I look at these 3 terms, first of all I noticed that all 3

00:00:34.632 --> 00:00:39.432
of the numbers are even, and 2 is the largest number so 2 is going to part of

00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:47.129
our GCF. If I look at the variables I have an a cubed, an a squared, and an a,

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.004
so the lowest power of a is to the first. I have a b, b squared and b cube to

00:00:55.004 --> 00:01:02.299
the lowest power of b is just b. When I factor out the GCF of 2ab from a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:10.143
polynomial, what I am left with? 2ab times a squared is meant 2a cube b. 2ab

00:01:10.143 --> 00:01:17.829
times minus 14ab, 2ab times negative 14ab, gives me negative 28 a squared, b

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:27.378
squared. And 2 times 48 gives me 96. A, I need a b squared. So after I factor

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:34.734
out the GCF of 2ab, I'm left with a squared minus 14ab plus 48b squared. Now I

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:41.151
need to factor this polynomial. For this polynomial, since the coefficient of

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:48.142
the a squared term is 1, I need the factors of 48 that add up to negative 14.

00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:52.502
Since this is a positive number and this is a negative number, I know that both

00:01:52.502 --> 00:01:56.520
of my factors are going to be negative. A negative times a negative is a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.900
positive and a negative plus a negative gives me a negative. When I think of the

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.917
number 48, there are several ways to factor the number. The 2 factors of

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:12.046
positive 48 that add up negative 14 is negative 6 times negative 8. So I can

00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:18.640
rewrite negative 14ab as negative 6ab minus 8ab. Now that I have 4 terms, I can

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.132
factor by grouping. Don't forget to carry down your GCF. Now I need to look at

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:29.772
the GCF of a squared and negative 6ab. Which is simply a. When I factor an a

00:02:29.772 --> 00:02:35.961
out, I'm left with a minus 6b. Now I need to factor out the GCF of the second

00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:39.694
two terms. I know I want my first term to be positive and my second to be

00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:45.336
negative. So I know I need to factor out a negative. The GCF of 8ab and 48b

00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:51.838
squared is going to be 8b. What do I need to multiply 8b by? What do I need to

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:57.338
multiply negative 8b by to get negative 8ab? Just a. And what do I need to

00:02:57.338 --> 00:03:04.580
multiply negative 8b by to get positive 48b squared? Negative 6b. Now the last

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.439
step for factoring by grouping here is to pull out the new GCF which is a minus

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:16.281
6b. And what do I have left over? A minus 8b, that's how we got the answer. I

00:03:16.281 --> 00:03:20.967
know these problems aren't easy, but factoring is a key skill for the whole rest

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:25.496
of the course. So it's very important that you're able to factor any polynomial

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:30.084
to finish this course. So don't get discouraged, it takes a lot of practice.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:34.387
Keep up the good work. And don't worry, you will master factoring. Factoring is

00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:38.664
a key concept for the rest of this course. We will be using factoring to solve

00:03:38.664 --> 00:03:42.420
many additional problems throughout the rest of the course. So mastering

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.359
factoring skill is extremely important. I know it's not easy, but the more you

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.933
practice, the better you'll get. And you will master factoring.
