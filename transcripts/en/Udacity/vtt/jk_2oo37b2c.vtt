00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Your job is now is to implement the backward Euler method for the SEIR model.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We provide the forward Euler method as a starting point.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So this end, we have reshuffled the order--EISR to make things easier.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We can start with the R equation using what you have computed for E and I and S before

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and then you can continue with S and with I.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Doing the backward Euler method for E, it's a little harder.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We provided the solution in case you don't want to spend that time.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If you start from the bottom, you can check your result whether or not it make sense

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
by running the software for that single line.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
When you're done, set the time step to 5 days to see that

00:00:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
this method can handle such a long time step.
