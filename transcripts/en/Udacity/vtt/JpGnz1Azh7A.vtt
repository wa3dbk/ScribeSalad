Say we're using depth peeling or some other advanced transparency technique.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.932
We're getting great pictures of transparent objects. Front faces and back faces

00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:12.404
are both rendered. And in the right order. Life is good. However, we then see

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:17.408
another rendering problem when we put a blue glass cube on a wood table. What is

00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:20.800
this major problem that gives horrible art effects that change from frame to

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.891
frame as the view changes. Is it that the bottom of the cube has z-fighting with

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:29.133
the top of the table. Absorption of the light is not properly accounted for by

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.871
the GPU. The bottom of the cube is black due to total internal reflection. Or

00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:36.610
the sides of the cube do not refract the light, causing black areas to occur.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.673
I'll give you a hint. It's something we've covered in this course.
