00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.050
And finally, the issue we want to consider is, what if we broadcast a stale

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.740
result. Let's see what a stale result is. Okay, so what we have here is

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.410
a situation when this divide here, is going to broadcast this result.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.840
It's going to broadcast that it's a reservation station 4, and broadcasting this

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.640
result which is the result of the division between these two numbers. But

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.630
if you look closely at the RAT. None of the registers is currently renamed to

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.320
this instruction. So how can this happen? Well, one way of it happening is that,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.860
when this instruction was renamed let's say that F4 was renamed to be this

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.250
result. So for a while this was saying RS4, but then another instruction came

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.320
let's say RS2 [UNKNOWN]. And let's say that it was taking R4 and

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.500
this, and writing again to the register 4. In that case, this would not say RS2,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.080
so simply this instruction no longer has any of the rad pointing to it. So

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.000
what's going to happen when we broadcast this result. What's going to happen is,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.180
for the filling the reservation stations, it's going to be done normally.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.020
Pretty much every entry, for every instruction is going to be matched against

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.070
the tag here, and wherever we match the tag, we're going to replace it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.200
with a value. So in this case we're going to write instead of this RS4 here,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.240
we're going to get minus 0.11. Okay? That's the only match, so we are done.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.090
The question is what happens with the register file and the RAT. In that case,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.070
in the RAT we do nothing. Why? Well because, the value from this instruction.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.540
Will never be used by any of the instructions that come later.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.100
The only reason why we needed the values in the register file is that,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.560
after this broadcast happens, all the instructions that need that value

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.930
are going to get it from the register file, so the value had better be in there.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.190
Also, all the instructions that come in after this instruction are going to

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.530
look here to see. What is the newest renamed value of this result?

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.380
And they're going to find RS2, for example, for the, for this value.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.330
However, if this is RS4 and this is RS2, that means that there is

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.000
a new instruction that is producing the value for this register. So basically,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.740
after this instruction here has been renamed. All the instructions that come and

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.870
read F4 should actually get the new value from you know, from this. So

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.670
this is basically the situation. We had a divide come first, for

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.420
awhile everything that reads F4 should be getting the value from the divide.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.570
After the ad here, as renamed F4 to point to it. All the instructions that

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.750
come after that, are supposed to use this value when they read R4.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.490
So, so this is entirely correct behavior. So pretty much what we're doing is,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.030
when we broadcast this and capture it here, we're giving it to any of

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.180
the instructions that sit between this divide and this side that

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.680
are actually using this result. But because the add has already been renamed.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.840
The instructions that we are renaming now and that we are getting results from

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.660
the register file, those instructions actually need the value from the add, so

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.220
they really don't need anything from, from this divide. So pretty much,

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.430
if the tag that has been broadcast doesn't match any of the entries in the RAT.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.250
Then we don't update the RAT, and we dont update the register file. And

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.810
it, it is perfectly fine because all of the instructions that possibly need this

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.380
value, are already reservation stations. When you do quizzes and so

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.600
on, be careful about this because it is so easy to you know,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.077
kind of just. Make the entry here point to the registar file. For example, here,

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:34.240
you know, it would be incorrect to delete this because it doesn't match this.
