00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:00.980
Hello.

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.760
My name is Kunal, and in this course,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.439
we will answer one big question Android
developers answer all the time, and

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.600
that question is,
how do you use blank in Android?

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.350
For instance, how do you use
radio buttons, or grids, or maps?

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.600
And a whole bunch of different

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.780
components that
are available in Android.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.880
Now if you think about it, developers
encountered this question all the time.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.830
And in response what they will do,
is that they will conduct a search on

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.100
the internet,
read something like a blog or

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.290
some stack overflow page on how
you do something in Android.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.600
And then they will try
that in their app.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.800
We will follow a similar
approach in this course.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.730
To be successful, you will need
the basics of Android programming.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.558
We took those in the Android for
beginners course.

00:00:44.558 --> 00:00:47.590
This is where, among other things,
we made the happy birthday app and

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.150
the Just Java app.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.370
You may also recall
that in the Android For

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.660
Beginners course, we learned
about buttons and check boxes.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.310
In this course, we will work with toggle
buttons, radio buttons, spinners, and

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.580
much more.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.480
Here is how this course
is going to work.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.060
For each of these interface elements
that you see on the screen here,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.380
we found the best resource on
the Internet that teaches you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.150
how to use them in your app.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.930
So for toggle buttons,
we will link you to a tutorial.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.500
For radio buttons,
we'll do the same thing.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.280
And trust us, these links are good.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.330
We know that because we've
used them ourselves.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.460
Here's what we want you to do.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.020
At the end of this video,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.720
you will see a tutorial on how to
use toggle buttons in Android.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.810
Follow the instructions
in that tutorial, and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.100
learn how to implement toggle buttons
in an app that you build from scratch.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.640
Once you're done with that, move on to
the tutorial for radio buttons and so

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.910
on so forth.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.750
Also, each one of these links that
you're about to see will take you about

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.100
30 to 60 minutes to learn.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.980
Once you do a few of these,
you will have mastered the process

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.590
experienced Android developers
follow every single day.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.090
Let's begin.
