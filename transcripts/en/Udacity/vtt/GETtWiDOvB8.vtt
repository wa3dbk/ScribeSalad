00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's the answer to turn this parser from a slow one to a fast one

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that doesn't repeat its work.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
All we need are these five characters.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
All we have to do is say let's apply the memo decorator to parse_atom, and then we're done.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The recursive call to parse_atom with term and the remainder as inputs.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We've done it once. This'll be the same call here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We just look it up in the cache table, and we've got the result.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Notice in order to make that work, I had to make this function, parse_atom,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
be something that had arguments that were hashable.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The atom and the text are both strings and those are both hashable,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but the original call to parse that had a grammar as the third argument--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
well, the grammar is a dictionary, and dictionaries are mutable, so they're not hashable.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I couldn't memoize the the whole parse function, and then have parse be called recursively here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That's why I had to have parse_atom and parse_sequence

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
be internal functions inside the definition of parse,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so that the grammar would be a variable that this function knows about,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
but it's not one of the arguments so that the memo decorator works.
