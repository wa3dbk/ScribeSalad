This modification just replaces p by 1-p in the return function and when I run it I get 0.7.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So the nice thing about our complimentary probability we can now plug in

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
a different value over here, say 0.1--with 0.1, I get as an output 0.9.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So congratulations, you've implemented the very first example of probability where the event

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
probability is 0.1 and the complementary event and negation of it

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.838
is encapsulated in this function over here.
