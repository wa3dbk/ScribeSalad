00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.100
Plugging in the numbers from our problem, we know that P is equal to 1000, and

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.640
R is equal to .03 N is equal to 1, which makes things pretty simple. Then into

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.779
our equation for A is A equals 1000 times 1 plus 0.03 to the t.
