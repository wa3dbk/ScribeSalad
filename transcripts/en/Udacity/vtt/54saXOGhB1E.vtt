So your task is to multiply this perspective matrix by three points and give

00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:07.878
the results. I want all four coordinates. Don't do anything beyond multiplying

00:00:07.878 --> 00:00:10.474
the points times the matrix, and don't forget that points have a fourth

00:00:10.474 --> 00:00:12.340
coordinate equal to one.
