00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.540
With off canvas,
instead of stacking content vertically,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.670
the off canvas places less frequently
used content, for example navigation or

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.060
app menus, off screen, only showing
them if the screen is large enough.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.950
On smaller screens, the off canvas
content is typically shown when

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.580
the user taps on the hamburger icon.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.310
Let's take a look and see how it's
done on the web fundamentals site.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.670
In narrow viewport,
the navigation menu is hidden,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.340
until I click the hamburger menu.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.400
In other cases,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.060
the off screen content may actually
come in from off the screen.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.990
In this sample page,
the content is coming in from the left.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.750
But in other cases,
it could come in from the right.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.310
Let's take a look at the code for
this example.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.530
I have two elements, the dark blue nav
and the main content in light blue.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.560
In order to make sure the elements
take up the full viewport width,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.600
I need to set the width on HTML,
body and main to 100 %.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.110
Next, I'll set the styles for
the off-canvas nav element.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.090
I'll set a specific width of 300 pixels,
being careful to keep it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.800
reasonably sized so
that it doesn't overflow the viewport.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.600
I'll use translate minus 300
pixels to move it off the screen.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.060
And add a transition of 0.3 seconds,
so that it animates in nicely.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.620
When I want it to appear, I'll add
an open class that resets the transform.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.120
Now, I'll add a break
point at 600 pixels that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.330
repositions everything
back to its normal spot.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.320
The media query at 600
pixels resets the transform.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.120
Adding flex grow 1 to the main
element allows the element to grow and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.420
take up the full remaining
width of the viewport.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.528
Let's give it a shot in the browser.

00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:53.940
When the viewport is small,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.210
the navigation panel is hidden
until I hit the hamburger menu.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.000
But, on wider view port,
it's shown by default.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.500
Nice
