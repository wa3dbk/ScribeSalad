00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.280
The simplest way to monetize your
game is with the premium model.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.670
You just submit your game to
the App Store and pick a price.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.860
And most app stores will automatically
convert the price you choose to

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.710
the correct currency for all the markets
you want to sell your app in.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.830
For example, if you want to sell to
an American market and choose a price of

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.280
99 cents for your game, the App Store
will convert this to the appropriate

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.460
currency for other countries,
like 0.75 euros for the European market.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.660
But even though this is the simplest
way to monetize your game,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.135
most games are still free.

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:35.876
People don't want to take the risk of
buying a game that they don't know

00:00:35.876 --> 00:00:36.565
much about.

00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:39.025
And so freemium games
reach the widest audience.

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:43.915
And it can be hard to choose between
making your game premium or freemium.

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:47.082
In fact,
many developers offer both options.

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:50.062
They offer a free version to
reach as many people as they can.

00:00:50.062 --> 00:00:53.992
And also a premium version that has
some benefit for more invested players.

00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:56.932
It's really common to have
a freemium option with ads and

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:59.032
a premium version that doesn't.

00:00:59.032 --> 00:01:01.602
This way both versions of
the game make money and

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:03.790
the player can choose whether or
not to pay.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.140
Next, let's look at
an example of a real game and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.830
see which monetization
model we think works best.
