00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.583
Another hypothesis regarding the biological factors that play a role in

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:08.842
schizophrenia is the dopamine hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:13.688
schizophrenia involves excess dopamine activity. One reason this hypothesis

00:00:13.688 --> 00:00:17.104
came about was from the observation of individuals who overdose on major

00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:23.104
stimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine. These individuals, if you recall

00:00:23.104 --> 00:00:26.642
from our lesson on drugs, have similar behaviors and cognitions as those

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:31.882
individuals with schizophrenia. Indeed, physicians have reported that it is

00:00:31.882 --> 00:00:35.776
difficult upon initial observation to determine whether somebody is

00:00:35.776 --> 00:00:42.000
schizophrenic, or whether they are overdosing from a major stimulant. Another

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.596
factor supporting the idea of the dopamine hypothesis, in regards to

00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:49.564
schizophrenia, was that drugs that block dopamine appear to be effective in

00:00:49.564 --> 00:00:55.080
treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, there are some

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.714
problems with the dopamine hypothesis. And we'll discuss that further in our

00:00:58.714 --> 00:01:02.738
next lesson, when we discuss treatments for mental disorders. Another neural

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:06.354
transmitter that does seem to play a role in schizophrenia is Glutamate. It

00:01:06.354 --> 00:01:10.897
appears that Glutamate deficiencies may also explain the symptoms of

00:01:10.897 --> 00:01:16.185
schizophrenia. That is, Glutamate is important in learning, memory, neural

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:21.153
processing and brain development. And it allows us to make some stimuli more

00:01:21.153 --> 00:01:26.422
important than others. Therefore, glutamate is crucial to selective attention,

00:01:26.422 --> 00:01:32.130
such as focusing attention on some items of information while ignoring others.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.034
And it may explain why these individuals have difficulty with sustained

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:41.838
attention, cognitive control, and working memory. Now let's go back to Lauren

00:01:41.838 --> 00:01:45.095
with the brain regions associated with schizophrenia.
