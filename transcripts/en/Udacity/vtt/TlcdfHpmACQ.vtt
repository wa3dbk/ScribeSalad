00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.046
To get t by itself you first want to divide both sides of the equation by 1000.

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:10.800
On the left-hand side that leaves us with 1.25 and simplifying what we have in

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.840
the parenthesis here. We have 1.03 to the t on the right-hand side. Now all we

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.560
have over here term of an exponent. So we just need to take some sort of log of

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.490
both sides to get t down out of the exponent, and by itself. Now as we've seen

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.170
before the log we need to use should have the same base as this base right

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:38.000
here, 1.03. So, interestingly enough, using log of base 1.03 for both sides.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.860
Well, that's certainly different from anything we've seen, but it works in the

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.485
same way as a log with the base of any other number. On the right-hand side

00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:55.010
here, we just get t. And on the left-hand side we have this log expression that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.395
we would of course like to evaluate. Now I usually prefer having t on the

00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:03.630
left-hand side, so I'm just going to switch it over there now. That just makes

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.730
things easier for me to see. Now since we don't have a log based 1.03 button on

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.360
the calculator, we're going to need to use change of base. How about this time

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.390
we use log of base 10. That means we're going to have, log base 10 of 1.25

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.110
divided by log base 10 of 1.03. Let's plug it in and see what that equals. So

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.760
here's our famous calculator. Log of 1.25 divided by log of 1.03. What does

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:40.780
that equal? Let's find out. 7.54914 and so on. Remember though, since Grant's

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.710
interest gets compounded only once a year, we need to round this up to 8, the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.291
next highest integer. So, that is our answer. After 8, years Grant will have

00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.337
over $1250 in the account.
