Now that we have our ASA data parsed we can use it to render to the screen.

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:07.111
Although you notice that our previous drawimage function doesn't allow us to

00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:10.616
draw sub section of an image. Effectively it only took in x and y position.

00:00:10.616 --> 00:00:14.206
Thankfully there's a version of drawimage that supports this ability but we

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:18.006
haven't really discussed it yet. There's an advanced version of the drawimage

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.654
API that takes in a few more parameters giving us more control on how we want to

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:25.662
get the pixels to the screen. In order to understand more about this we cruise

00:00:25.662 --> 00:00:29.596
over to webplatform.org so we can take a look at the data. The new parameters

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:33.610
that we should be looking at are this. First off we handle the same image object

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.481
that we took with our previous drawImage API. And then we have the source x,

00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:41.642
source y, source width, and source height parameters. These represent the xy

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:45.734
position of our chart in our atlas as well as the width and the height of that

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:50.242
chart in the atlas. The destination x, y, width, and height represent the

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:55.106
position and size that this small subsection of our atlas is going to be drawn

00:00:55.106 --> 00:01:00.074
to in the output canvas. So, for example, we can set source x and source y to 2,

00:01:00.074 --> 00:01:04.792
2. Width and height to 32, 32. And draw to a position on canvas of 128, 128 by

00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:09.292
64 by 64, drawImage is smart enough to know that if the source, width, and

00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:14.033
height don't match the destination, width and height. To probably scale the

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:18.220
image to match the desired output size. For our purposes in grids we really

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.164
don't do any scaling so for 99.9% of the time source, width, height and

00:01:22.164 --> 00:01:24.827
destination, width, height are the same size.
