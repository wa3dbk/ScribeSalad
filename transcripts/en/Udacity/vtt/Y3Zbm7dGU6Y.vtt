All right, you're done. Let me show you my solution.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.320
We start by creating an empty uri matcher. I don't want the root node to match

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.720
anything. This is typical behavior. To make the

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.490
code easier to read, I'm making a shortcut

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.000
to the weather contract content authority. Technically, date

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.700
will always be numeric, but I'm matching the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.770
paths with star, because they are stored in

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.200
our database as strings, just to be consistent.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.930
Finally, we have the location URIs. Since the ID in the database is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.670
always a long integer, it makes perfect sense to use the pound sign pattern.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.474
Now we can add our class variable. [BLANK_AUDIO}
