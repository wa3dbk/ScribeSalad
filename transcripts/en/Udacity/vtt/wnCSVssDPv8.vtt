00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.090
Before we get started,

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.360
let's talk about how to evaluate whether
or not you're ready to take this class.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.710
To take this class, you should answer
yes to all of the following questions.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.400
First, have you already
fulfilled your foundational

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.860
requirement for the program?

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.500
That's going to give you experience
receiving educational technology, which

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.550
should really be all the preparation you
need for the content of this course.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.510
Second, are you
comfortable with writing?

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.870
This course is going to involve several
short and a couple long essays, so

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.690
to succeed you need to be
comfortable writing essays.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.550
Third, are you comfortable with a course
that's going to evaluate participation

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.720
as a first class object in the grading?

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.410
Because this course is built
on the discussions and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.190
conversations, we're going to
explicitly evaluate whether or

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.370
not you participated in the course.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.305
Fourth, are you comfortable
with taking on a big,

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:41.230
open-ended group project as part
of your work for this class?

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.080
Or alternatively,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.250
are you comfortable with taking
on a big project all on your own?

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.620
Because the goal of this class is to
produce something that's had an actual

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.090
contribution to the educational
technology community,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.660
the scope of the project
will be very large.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.522
So you need to be comfortable with
that kind of project for this course.

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:57.959
Fifth, are you passionate about
education and educational technology?

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:59.144
Do you already have some ideas for

00:00:59.144 --> 00:01:01.697
the kinds of tools you might want to
build or research you want to conduct?

00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:03.654
Because this class is built
around the project, and

00:01:03.654 --> 00:01:05.302
because you'll specify your own project,

00:01:05.302 --> 00:01:08.700
it's really important that you be
invested in what you're working on.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.398
And lastly, are you comfortable with a
class that's really built on these big,

00:01:11.398 --> 00:01:13.490
open-ended, student-driven projects?

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.940
In this class, you're going to propose
your own project, execute it and

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.760
deliver it at the end of the semester.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.580
The requirements will be very fuzzy,
the grading will be very informal,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.270
and there's not really a schedule
of what you need to do or watch or

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.540
read and when.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.590
And that kind of structure can be
very frustrating for some students.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.790
Now before we move on, let's also talk
about the things that aren't required.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.050
You'll notice that I didn't ask any
questions about programming ability.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.270
And in fact, you can take this class and
you can complete this class without

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.152
writing a single line of code by doing
research or user testing or design.

00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:42.290
And note that I also didn't ask
if you have experience with

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.830
educational technology.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.380
This class is built so
that the only real experience you need

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.290
is the experience you've already
gotten in the LMS program.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.880
So you don't really need either
of those things to succeed, but

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.790
you do need to answer yes
to the previous questions.
