00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.070
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This one was c. If you got it right, excellent work. Just like in the first

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.964
practice problem, we want to get the boundary line, so let's solve this

00:00:07.964 --> 00:00:12.104
inequality for y. First we subtract 3x from both sides, then we divide both

00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:16.288
sides of the inequality by negative 5. Remember, both these terms need to be

00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:20.941
divided by negative 5. And here we need to be very careful. We divided by a

00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:25.971
negative so we need to reverse the inequality sign. Now we're ready to graph.

00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:31.050
The y intercept is negative 3, which is here. 3 units down from the origin. Our

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.705
slope is positive 3 5ths, so we rise 3 units up and run 5 units to the right.

00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:40.405
Now, I have two points and I can draw my boundary line. I have a less than

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:45.265
symbol so I need to draw a dash line, because I can't include points on the

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:50.403
line. And finally, we use a test point to determine which region should be

00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:55.440
shaded, the top region or the lower region. If I plug in 0 for x and 0 for y I

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.572
get 0 is less than negative 3. I know this statement isn't true, so I don't want

00:01:00.572 --> 00:01:05.266
points in this region. I want this region. This should be my solution region and

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:09.537
I can test another point in this region to be sure I'm going to use the point

00:01:09.537 --> 00:01:14.041
zero negative four and remember you could choose any point in this region. It

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:19.676
wouldn't matter. If I plug in 0 for x and negative 4 for y, I get negative 4 is

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:25.692
less than negative 3. This is a true statement, so yeah, I did this problem

00:01:25.692 --> 00:01:26.707
correctly.
