So we demonstrated how you can condition a fear response with a little Albert

00:00:02.882 --> 00:00:06.340
study. But there are some fear responses that can be conditioned after a single

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.385
pairing. Phobias can be conditioned after a single pairing. Say you were stung

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:13.950
by a bee once and you were allergic, so every time you saw a bee you were

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.528
scared of it. Or if you had a near drowning experience when swimming, you might

00:00:18.528 --> 00:00:22.640
always be scared of the water after that. But we're going to talk about phobias

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.394
more later in the course when we talk about psychological disorders. But there

00:00:26.394 --> 00:00:29.592
is one thing I want to talk about here. Condition taste aversion. That can

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:32.985
happen after just a single pairing. Let me go grab Susan so I can demonstrate

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:34.170
this to you guys.
