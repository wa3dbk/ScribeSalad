00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.640
In DRAM, we also have a transistor
that is activated by the wordline and

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.480
that connects the cell to the bit line.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.080
But we said that's the only
transistor we have.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.330
The cell is made out of
a simple capacitor here.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.010
So, the idea is that to write to this
cell we will activate the wordline,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.920
we put let's say A1 into the bitline.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.310
This transistor connects
the capacitor to the bitline.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.470
Now what happens is R1 effectively
charges this capacitor.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.020
Once we deactivate the wordline,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.930
the capacitor retains the value
that corresponds to a 1.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.040
If we want to write a 0,
we activate the wordline.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.650
The capacitor is now connected
to the bitline that is connected

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.210
to a zero voltage, and we empty
this capacitor into the bitline,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.410
thus now our capacitor
becomes a zero value.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.670
Now when we disconnect the wordline,
the capacitor has nothing in it, so

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.760
it retains the value of 0.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.530
So as you can see, the bit is
really stored in this capacitor.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.580
When it's charged, we are storing a 1.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.650
When it's not charged,
we are storing a 0.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770
So what's the problem here?

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.140
Well the problem is that this
transistor is not a perfect switch.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.230
It's a little bit leaky.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.754
Here it's not a problem because
if it's a little bit leaky,

00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:28.812
these two are strong enough to retain
the voltage at let's say 1 and

00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:33.630
0 or 0 and 1, while these
are not trying to defeat them.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.020
But here our capacitor is slowly
leaking into the bit line and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.220
eventually gets empty.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.890
So one problem with DRAM is that it
will lose this bit over time, and

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.770
that means that periodically we
have to actually read out this bit,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.220
figure out what it was, and
write it back in at full voltage so

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.750
that it can again leak for
a while before it gets lost.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.170
Another problem with DRAM that
you don't have with SRAM is that

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.110
once we open the wordline,
the capacitor drains into the bit line.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.740
We can sense what the value was, but the
capacitor is no longer fully charged.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.330
This is called destructive read.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.730
When you read a DRAM cell,
you have to write it back in.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.110
It loses the value as it gets read.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.420
So this is what is usually called
a 6T cell or 6 transistor cell.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.030
That are two transistors that are there
for connecting to the cell and

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.190
there are four transistors in the cell
itself because each of the inverters has

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.680
two transistors.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.790
This is, of course, a 1T cell.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.410
Now, the area occupied by an SRAM
cell obviously is the area occupied

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.710
by about six transistors.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.590
The area of the DRAM cell it looks like
it's the area of one transistor and

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.650
the area of the capacitor.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.980
The bigger this capacitor the longer it
can retain something that corresponds

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.100
to a 1 or a 0 before it gets lost,
so we want this capacitor to be big.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.280
A capacitor can be viewed as two metal
plates placed very close to each other.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.950
The bigger the area of the plates, the
bigger the capacitance of the capacitor,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:13.950
it can keep more charge.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.490
So it looks like, to make a good DRAM
cell, we will have to make a big cell

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.140
because this capacitor will need a lot
of metal area to build large plates,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.080
but this is not how we
build this capacitor.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.940
The transistor and
the capacitor itself are actually built

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.350
as a single transistor in a technology
that is called trench cell.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.580
So this end of this transistor
is simply buried deeply

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.420
into the silicon substrate when
we manufacture transistors.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.110
So really the capacitor is kind
of buried under the transistor.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.710
So we really get the area of
the transistor itself and

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.970
not much around it.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.480
You can see also that the DRAM cell

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.070
can be smaller because it doesn't
need this second bit line.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.160
We just need one, so
that also makes it slightly smaller.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.590
We don't need as much wiring there.
