00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.320
In this video, I've built
a sample app that has geofences

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.770
around the studios that I'm filming in.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.000
As you build out your app, you'll likely
want to use a different geofence.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.850
As we've explained earlier, a geofence
uses latitude and longitude and

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.080
an easy way to find the lat long for
any location is to use Google Maps.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.680
You can either look at the URL when
you are in a particular location, and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.520
pull the latitude and longitude from
them, or if you prefer, you can drop

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.280
a pin and then you can see the latitude
and longitude in the pop-up.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.370
Note that it also depends
on your zoom level.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.610
So, here I zoomed into the the top
secret military base at Area 51 and

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.620
you can see it can actually get
the latitude and longitude for

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.080
the baseball field there.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.510
That must be where
the aliens play baseball.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.470
Or if they're more the tennis type,
I can drop the pin here and

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.660
then get the latitude and
longitude for the tennis courts.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.750
Yes, believe it or not,
there's a baseball field and

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.100
tennis courts in area 51.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.080
Now if you prefer to go to
a slightly less secret place,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.120
you can zoom in on anywhere you like,
for example the Google campus.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.660
And here I'll find the latitude and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.390
longitude of my favorite coffee shop,
which is right here in this building.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.420
There's the latitude and longitude.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.300
So it's up to you.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.110
You can find locations wherever you like
on Google Maps, and like I said you can

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.770
either look at the URL, as you can see
here, to get the latitude and longitude,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.930
or you can drop the pen and the latitude
and longitude will be presented to you.
