00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.930
Now recall from our previous lectures, where we

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.000
had basically talked about how computational photography is a process that takes

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.360
information from a three-dimensional scene, and goes through a series of

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.560
different steps to be able to generate an image that a user can interact with.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.760
So in the whole traditional aspect of computational photography,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.630
we start 3D scene, that is illuminated, optics is used to be able to

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.160
get information from the scene onto a sensor, which converts it into pixels.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.960
And we've looked at in detail how image processing techniques can take

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.560
the pixels for enhancement or even for analysis of images, like finding features

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.400
that would be then used for various computational photography processes.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.350
The thing I want everybody to remember is, what we're interested in is going

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.660
from rays of light in a 3D scene, and going to be able to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.360
generate pixels that can be used for various types of computational processes.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.220
Of course, we want the computational processes to also impact illumination,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.310
optics, sensor, not just image processing.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.150
So, one thing I want to emphasize also is that, in the study of computational

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.170
photography, we do rely on various types of disciplines, ranging from optics,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.340
sensors, computer vision, computer graphics and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.905
image processing, and they impact each and every aspect of this pipeline,

00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:18.580
of we're trying to get information all the way from 3D scenes,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.560
to actually generate an image that could be processed and displayed.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.320
And these are the disciplines that we have, kind of will be studying in

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.740
different details to help us build the foundations of computational photography.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.120
We already looked at image processing to kind of help us extract

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.850
information from images, but we will be looking at more scene analysis and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.250
stuff like that from optics and also from computer vision.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.540
And we'll study things like sensors, especially camera sensors and

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.010
how light is actually captured.
