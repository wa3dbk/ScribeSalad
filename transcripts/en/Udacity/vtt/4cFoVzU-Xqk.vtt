00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The first thing that it's important to notice about the supplied code is that in the array angles,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the angles are measured in degrees but as we said earlier,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the cosine and sine functions in Python's math library take arguments

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that are measured in radians not in degrees.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So first thing that we need to do is convert each of the angles in the array angles into radians.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We do that by multiplying each angle by π and dividing by 180.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This gives us a new variable angle in radians or angle rad.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The next step is to set the initial position and velocity of the particle.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
As you can see from these two lines, we've decided that

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the particle is going to be in a zero in both the horizontal and vertical planes.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This means that it's starting at the origin.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Moving on to velocity, we set both the horizontal and the vertical velocity

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
by taking the initial speed which we set up here,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and multiplying by the cosine of the angle which we just converted

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
for the horizontal velocity or the sine for the vertical velocity.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Lastly, we finally make use of the Forward Euler Method.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If we want to find out what the position after the next step is going to be,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
then we begin with a position at the step they were at

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and then add the time step times the velocity at that present step.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You remember that this makes sense in terms of units because h is measured in time

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and v is measured in distance over time which makes this term

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
also measured in distance just like x.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We do something very similar with velocity except that this time,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the acceleration is a constant which we set up here as the gravitational constant.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This means that the value of the acceleration is not going to change

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
from step to step although the value of the velocity will.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Something else that you might want to know is that we've only set the range

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to go from 0 to num steps - 1.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You might initially have thought that we should insert num steps +1 as the argument of the range.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But because we're looking at the step +1 row in both x and v,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
we need to restrict the range to be one less than we would have otherwise needed.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
In fact, I made this error myself when I was looking over the code.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So it makes perfect sense if you were thinking that too.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
After all this has been filled in, we can run the program and get this plot.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now this is a plot of the position, not of the velocity.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You can see that the horizontal axis measures the horizontal position in meters.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The vertical axis measures the vertical position in meters.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Each different series here corresponds to each different element in the angles array.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
As you can see, because each of these particles is leaving out a different initial angle.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
&gt;From this graph, we can see that as we change the initial angle,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
we also drastically change where the particles going to end up landing.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now, we move on to a problem that combines both this idea of ballistic trajectory

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and the idea of orbits from the previous problem.
