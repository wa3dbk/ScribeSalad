00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.320
Developmental psychologists have discovered some changes that occur in late

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.308
adulthood, beginning in the late 60s and early 70s. These changes are slower

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:12.788
processing and limited working memory, but this is universal, it's not

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:19.194
dementia, which is a much more serious form of cognitive impairment. We do see

00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:24.502
however that as neural processing slows down it doesn't stop. Therefore, people

00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:27.322
in their 70s can learn lot's of new things, such as languages and even new

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:28.770
technologies.
