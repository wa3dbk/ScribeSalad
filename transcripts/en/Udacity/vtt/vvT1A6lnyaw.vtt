00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.607
Now that you have a handle on adding polynomials, let's try subtracting them.

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:08.895
When we subtract polynomials we need to subtract the second quantity. We can

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:13.370
think of this problem just like this problem. We know in this problem we don't

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.140
just subtract the one, we need to subtract a total of six. So we can subtract

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.420
the 1, subtract the 2 and subtract the 3. This is why these parentheses are so

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.100
important they indicate that when you subtract a total of 6 and not just a total

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.960
of 1. We get an answer of 9 here but this isn't so important, whats important is

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.438
what we did right here. We distributed a negative 1, we're going to use the same

00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:41.530
line of thinking for tackling this whenever you subtract a quantity, you want to

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.305
change every single sign because we're multiplying by a negative one. So I

00:00:46.305 --> 00:00:51.247
multiply each term by negative 1 and really that just changes all their signs.

00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:55.040
You don't have to show this step in your problem solving, but if it helps, you

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.277
do it. Here's our expression after we multiply by negative 1. Once we're here we

00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:04.340
carry out the problem just like addition. We regroup our like terms, and then we

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.203
combine them x squared plus 2x plus 2. Here's our final polynomial.
