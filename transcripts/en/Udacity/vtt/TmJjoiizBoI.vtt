00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.960
We are going to now leave you with some
food for thought on outlier detection.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.430
The first question we
want to ask you is,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.970
is Mahalanobis distance a good method to
detect outliers in the Medicare data?

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.530
To answer that,
let's try to ask another question.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.400
Are Outliers in bivariate data

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.480
indicative of true outliers when
the data has more dimensions?

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.490
Think about these questions for a while.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.620
These questions are not graded quiz but
just food for thought.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.720
Share your thoughts with other
students in the forum and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.360
we will post a link for
you in the instructor's comments.
