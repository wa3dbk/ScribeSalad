00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.536
To continue this problem, we're just going
to apply the distributive property to both

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:07.700
this part of the expression and this part
of the expression. And now we simplify

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.054
within each term and combine like terms.
One quick thing to take note of before I

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:15.344
write the final, final answer for this
question, let's look at each of these

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:21.131
terms. First we have x^2.
Now x^2 is just x times x, or x times x. The first

00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:26.331
terms, in each of our factors, multiplied
together. Then we have 5 times x, or the

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:28.904
second term of our first factor
multiplied by the first term of our second

00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:34.452
factor. Then we have -2x, which is just 
-2 times x. The first term from our first factor

00:00:34.452 --> 00:00:40.082
times the second term of our second
factor. And lastly, -2 times 5. Or -10, which

00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:46.429
is just this factor, 5, times this factor,
-2. So you can see that we've taken every

00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:52.270
combination of pairs of terms from these
two factors and multiplied them together

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.084
in order to get our final answer, which is
just x^2 + 3x - 10.
