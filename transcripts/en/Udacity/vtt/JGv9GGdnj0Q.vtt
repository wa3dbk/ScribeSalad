00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.110
So two cases down, one third case to handle is if in fact

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.740
the first elements of x and y are not the same. To deal with this

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.079
case what we're going to do is we're going to carve up Y into three pieces, and

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.780
we're going to determine what those three pieces are based on where and

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.240
why the first element of X is. So, the first element of X is five.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.830
Someplace in Y there is a five otherwise it's not a permutation. So

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.000
let's call the position of five in y the jth position and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.830
our three segments are going to be from one up to J minus one. Second segment is

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.990
going to be the jth position all by itself and the third segment is going to

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.470
be the j plus first position all the way to the nth position.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.460
The last position. Three segments and we are going to define whether or

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.810
not x and y are permutations in terms of those three segments.
