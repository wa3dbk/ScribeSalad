00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.147
So in this last section, we're going to discuss the combined approaches, of

00:00:03.147 --> 00:00:08.412
which there are three. When we combine psycho therapy and drugs and integrative

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:12.922
therapy and mindfulness training and drugs. So let's talk about the first one

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:17.798
first. Psychotherapy and drugs, so this is in fact a very effective and popular

00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:24.485
combination when we're treating anxiety and mood disorders. So the idea here is

00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:28.385
that the drugs will focus on and alleviate the anxiety of mood disorder,

00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:34.810
whereas as the psychotherapy helps the person manage their irrational thoughts.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.922
So another common combination treatment in therapy is when we combine cognitive

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:45.087
behavioral therapy with drug therapy to treat depression. In fact, sometimes we

00:00:45.087 --> 00:00:50.878
also have in this mix a token economy behavior modification therapy. In fact,

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:55.102
that combination of drug and token economy behavior modification is also seen

00:00:55.102 --> 00:01:00.596
in treating children with ADHD. So the idea is that this stimulant medication

00:01:00.596 --> 00:01:06.203
will help control some of the symptoms. And then every time the child acts in a

00:01:06.203 --> 00:01:10.200
non-hyperactive way, they get reinforced with a token.
