00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.590
So in this lesson, we will go through
several challenges that a many-core

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.560
processor, that is a processor with
a very large number of cores, will face.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.250
The first challenge is that as
we grow the number of cores,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.540
the coherence traffic
between these cores goes up.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.840
And that is because we have already seen
that writes to shared memory locations.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.260
Resulting in validations and
subsequent misses on those locations.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.530
And both invalidations and the resulting
misses go onto the shared bus,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.320
and thus, add to this coherent traffic.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.490
As we increase the number of cores,
we get more writes per second.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.750
And, as a result,
the bus throughput that we need goes up,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.520
until it eventually exceeds
what we can do on a bus.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.280
Unfortunately, the bus allows us
to only do one request at a time.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.280
In part, that is needed because
we rely on the bus to produce

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.350
the easy ordering that we get
between rides to maintain coherence.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.030
But that means that really the bus
eventually becomes the bottleneck.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.960
So, what we need is
a scalable on-chip network

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.420
that allows the traffic to grow
as the number, of course, grows.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.420
And then we also need to
use directory coherence so

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.280
that we don't rely on the bus
to serialize everything for us.
