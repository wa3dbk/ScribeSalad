00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.240
Now that you can load and
draw sprites and

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.540
animations, it's time to
start work on Gigagal.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.820
In this level, we'll plan out
the structure of the game,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.720
build out a project skeleton, and
set up our asset loading system.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.010
Then we'll focus in on
creating Gigagal herself.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.290
To keep track of the state of Gigagal,
and to know what sprite or

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.210
animation to draw, we need to keep
track of five things: Her position and

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.120
velocity, what direction she's facing,
whether or

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.020
not she's walking and what state
of jumping or falling she's in.

00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:31.730
Giga gal is a complex class, for sure.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.950
But at the end of this level,
we'll have a fun character to play with.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.610
Let's get started.
