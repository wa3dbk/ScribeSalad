00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.230
Let's imagine I wanted to send a message
to Cameron without anyone else being to

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.790
see that message.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.190
If I were to just place this note on
Cameron's desk, anyone could come by and

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.580
read it.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.060
I could find a box with a lock and
lock the message away but

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.658
then I have to somehow
get this key to Cameron.

00:00:16.658 --> 00:00:19.580
That's not going to work because
anyone will be able to come by and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.170
grab the key.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.370
But what if Cameron already
had a box set up on his desk,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.840
with his own lock, and the key to unlock
that box is always in Cameron's pocket?

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.080
He never shares that key with anyone.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.330
I can then come by his desk, place
my message in the box, and lock it.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.030
And no one else can
ever see that message.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.620
In this example,
the box is called the public key.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.900
The box can be left out in the open,
shared around without any consequence.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.900
The key in Cameron's pocket
is called a private key.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.150
Cameron never let's anybody else
borrow that key or see it.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.530
This combination of public and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.160
private keys allows me to securely
communicate with Cameron.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.570
This same cryptography trick can be used
to authenticate a client with a server.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.560
The server will send a random
message to the client.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.200
The client will encrypt that
message with their private key, and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.030
then send that encrypted
message back to the server.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.180
The server will decrypt this
message with their public key and

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.400
if that value equals the same value they
sent, then everything checks out and

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.600
the client has authenticated.
