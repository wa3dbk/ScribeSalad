00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.019
Let's talk a little bit more about the technique of completing the square. Now

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.050
we've used this a lot to figure out how to get equations for parabolas in vertex

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.101
form but we can also use it to factor expressions and to solve other equations.

00:00:12.101 --> 00:00:16.239
It's the technique that could be used in a ton of different circumstances. First

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.175
things first, let's see how we can use this to factor. Now earlier on in this

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:24.335
lesson, we saw that we could write this in a modified version of the equation in

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:28.571
vertex form as y equals the quantity x minus 4 squared minus 1. Notice that the

00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:32.475
first term here is a squared term and the second term, apart from the minus

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:36.550
sign, is also a squareed term. Because we have one squared term that's being

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.834
subtracted from another squared term, we can call this an instance of difference

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:44.965
of squares. In genereal, if we have two squared terms, a squared and b squared

00:00:44.965 --> 00:00:49.061
and we write a squared minus b squared then remember that we can factor this in

00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:53.262
an interesting way. This is just equal to a plus b times a minus b. Match up our

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:56.983
difference of squares here, with this general form for the difference of

00:00:56.983 --> 00:01:00.865
squares. Can you tell me what a and b are, in the case that we have right here

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:02.700
on the right side of our equation?
