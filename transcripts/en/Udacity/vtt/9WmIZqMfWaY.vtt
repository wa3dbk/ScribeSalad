We just decided that for this situation, we need to have x being greater than 0.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.754
But what if I told you that this restriction on x had a special name? In fact,

00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:16.804
it does. In this case, x is greater than 0 is called the domain of the function

00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:20.498
A of x. So, if this is the case, then what do you think we can say in general

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:24.963
about domain? Is the domain of a function the set of all possible inputs? The

00:00:24.963 --> 00:00:29.263
set of all possible outputs? The set of all possible values at the independant

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:33.117
variable? Or the set of possible values of the dependent variable?
