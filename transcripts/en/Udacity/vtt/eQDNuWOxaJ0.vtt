00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.760
And the answer is, none of them. This is more than

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.250
just a trick question. The point I'm trying to make, is

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.039
that all of these browsers are a little different. And if

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.290
you've used more than one of them, you'll know that, that's

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.020
obviously true. However, none of these browsers are perfect. And in

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.670
fact, it's not even clear when we're doing web development what

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.680
perfect is. It, it's a very imperfect art the web design

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.220
is. And so, while you may have a preference for one

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.640
of these browsers, it is not necessarily true that your

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.990
users agree. You know, you may like Chrome, and your

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.180
users may prefer Internet Explorer. Or more realist, realistically, you

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.750
may like Chrome, and your users are forced to use Internet

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.880
Explorer. So you need to have in mind that all

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.220
of these browsers are different. They all behave differently. And

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.950
you need to keep that in mind as you as

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.240
you develop and test in as many browsers as you can.
