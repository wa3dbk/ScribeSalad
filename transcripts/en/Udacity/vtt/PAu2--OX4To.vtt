Let's use our idea of perimeter to solve this problem. The length of a rectangle

00:00:04.306 --> 00:00:08.377
is 6 feet more than its width, and the perimeter of that rectangle is 52 feet.

00:00:08.473 --> 00:00:12.519
What are the dimensions, length and width, of the rectangle? To start this

00:00:12.531 --> 00:00:16.745
problem, let's draw a diagram. Here's a rectangle, with a width and a length.

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:21.179
Notice the opposite sides of the rectangle are the same. This is true for all

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:25.842
rectangles. Before we answer this question, let's break our problem down into a

00:00:25.854 --> 00:00:30.363
smaller step. Let's start with an equation. So I want you to write an equation

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:34.820
for the perimeter of the rectangle. Use p for the perimeter, l for the length,

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:39.494
and w for the width. Write your equation in this box. Remember, equations have

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.436
an equal sign, expressions don't.
