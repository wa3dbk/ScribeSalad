00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.730
So now, we have the buzz image.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.000
We know it has a width and height.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.400
Basically we want to use this to give it a numeric representation of this

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.630
image in two dimensions.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.760
So we can actually be looking for information in it in the x and

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.490
the y directions.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.340
The best way to refer to this would be a now a function I xy which

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.040
is a continuous function.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.430
Or if we have a discrete, we'd actually be able to refer to this as I of ij.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.370
So i, j here would be discrete indices, which could be the number of

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.370
the rows and the column that we're trying to traverse this thing.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.890
If this was, of course, a continuous function, we would be looking for

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.100
variables x and y to be able to now extract the information out of this image.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.420
And of course, one more thing to add here is then basically we tried to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.330
take the resolution of the image, which is represented in terms of width and

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.910
height as I showed in the last slide.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.240
Or basically just showing here, very quickly, as to an image basically as

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.400
the scope of these images, defined by the width of the number of columns and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.590
the height of the number of rows of this image.
