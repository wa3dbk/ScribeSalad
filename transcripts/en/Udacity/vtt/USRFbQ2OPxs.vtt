00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.230
So, show you results of some of their
experiments since they have the results

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.680
easily available on the Web.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.720
Now, when this paper was written,
which was a while ago,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.310
they were running 30 frames per
second on a 320 by 240 image.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.090
So now it can go faster because time
passes and machines get faster.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.830
They are also only using
500 possible samples.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.170
That's 500 possible new proposals.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.050
Now maybe you can do 5,000.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.650
They use 50 eigenvectors.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.595
Maybe you could use more.

00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:26.822
It is the actual numbers
don't matter yet.

00:00:26.822 --> 00:00:29.180
The goal it was nice and
it was kind of in real time.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.700
In fact, that's why I put down it runs
at XXX frames per second using Matlab.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.491
Where XXS is, XXX is going to be more
than two and less than 90,000, so

00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:38.909
it's in there somewhere.

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:41.540
It depends on how fast your computer is.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.543
So here's some results
that they show you.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.351
Now up here this is the main image, and

00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:47.808
you can see they're
tracking the face there.

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:51.510
What you're going to see here
is going to be mostly about

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.150
where the image is being explained best.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.420
We're going to talk about that
more when we talk about occlusion.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.410
And what you're going to see
down here are about 10 of the,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.580
of the eigenbases, right?

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.590
And you're going to see that they're
changing as the appearance changes.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.590
So if I press, there we go.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.470
All right.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.310
And so

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.400
you can see that it's doing a pretty
fine job of explaining the the face.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.050
Sorry, of tracking the face.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.900
That middle row that I was talking
about, that has to do with

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.780
what am I seeing versus how well can I
reconstruct it from the basis set, and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.010
it's using that as its evaluation.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.160
And you can see,
with really large lighting variations,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.060
it tracks really well.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.575
You saw it got stuck there at
the very end, and that sort of, as,

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:34.760
as far as it could go.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.345
Yeah, here's another example where
you're going to see a lot of sort of

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:41.141
change in orientation and
change of appearance,

00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:43.842
and this is Sylvester
the cat being tracked.

00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:47.902
And you can see that it creates a lot
of really sort of creepy lookingSyl-,

00:01:47.902 --> 00:01:49.394
Sylvesters on the bottom.

00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:51.634
Those are the eigen, the eigan cats.

00:01:51.634 --> 00:01:55.660
The images of, of the thing, and, and
that's how it's doing its tracking.
