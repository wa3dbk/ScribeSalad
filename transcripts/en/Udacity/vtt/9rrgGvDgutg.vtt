00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.099
So let's construct a table like this. In the first column, we'll consider different programs.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.266
And I'm just going to label them p1 for the first program, p2 for the second program, and so on and so on.

00:00:11.267 --> 00:00:18.399
In the second column we'll then consider different cases of what halt can say with respect to that program,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.566
when considering what happens if the program is run on itself.

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:31.832
So for example, we might say that for P1, halt might say yes, and for P2 it might say no when given the program,

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:34.566
and the program has an input.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:42.632
Now, what does that mean? So if halt says yes in the first line here, it would mean that program one stops

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:51.266
when given program one as an input. And of course, similarly, if halt says no, it would mean that P2 goes into an infinite loop

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.832
when given P2 or itself as an input.

00:00:54.833 --> 00:01:01.499
Now we're going to do a very quick quiz here, because what I would like you to think about here for P1 and P2,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.899
what inverse halt, when run on that program, actually does. So what does inverse halt do when it's run on P1?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.999
And what does inverse halt do when it's run on P2?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.066
So does inverse halt, when run on P1, halt or go into an infinite loop?

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:18.999
And does inverse halt, when run on P2, halt or go into an infinite loop?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.133
So please check the one that is correct for each one.
