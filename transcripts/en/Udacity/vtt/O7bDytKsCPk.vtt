Hi, I'm Mike Wales,
a program manager here at Udacity.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.970
We're very excited you've decided to
take this next step in advancing your

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.870
career, by enrolling in our senior
web developer nanodegree program.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.810
The Web and the capabilities
we're provided by browsers

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.630
has changed significantly
in the past few years.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.770
That's what this program is all about.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.880
You'll learn from amazing Googlers,
many of which have worked directly

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.620
on the specs for
these exciting new features.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.840
Through the course of this program,
you'll develop a series of progressive

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.240
web applications, making use of
features like service workers,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.860
push notifications, device center
access, and home screen installation.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.250
Furthermore, you'll start analyzing
frameworks and technologies to figure

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.610
out the best tools for you and your
applications to work most efficiently.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.890
By the end of this program, you'll
have a compelling portfolio that shows

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.370
employers you've mastered the latest
technologies within our field, and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.230
you can develop web applications
with many of the features

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.380
only native web applications
have enjoyed in the past.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.880
So good luck, and have fun learning.
