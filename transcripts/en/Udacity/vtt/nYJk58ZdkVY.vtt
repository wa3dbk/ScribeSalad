00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here I've continued my wishful thinking,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and I've written out the complete grammar. I think I've got it right.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now all I'm missing is something that understands this format.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's continue the wishful thinking and wish that we had

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
a function that could take this format and turn it into something

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that we can then use in a parser.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here I have applied the wishful thinking and said I wish I had this function grammar

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that would give me this grammar G, and then I could use it to parse expressions.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now it's up to me to deliver on that promise or that wishful thinking.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The first thing I should ask myself is what do I want this object G to look like?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
One good idea is that G could be a dictionary.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The keys of the dictionary would be these things on the left-hand side,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and then the values of each key would be some object corresponding

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
to this representation on the right-hand side.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I would have expression--something like this.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now all I've got to do is figure out what goes on the right-hand side.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Here I've made a choice, and what I've said is,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
well, the right-hand side looks like it's always going to be a set of alternatives.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The order matters, so I'm not going to make it into a set.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm going to make it into a sequence of some kind, and let's make that a tuple.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The right-hand side is always going to be a tuple of alternatives.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It might be a tuple of length 1, but it's always going to be a tuple.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Each element of that tuple is going to be a sequence--

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
here a sequence of three items, here a sequence of one items.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We'll represent sequences as lists.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Here are the three items, and here is the one item.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Every right-hand side is a tuple of lists where the lists are a sequence

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and each element of the list is a atom.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The atoms can either be the name of a category that's defined on the left-hand side,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
or they can be a regular expression that's going to match actual characters

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
in the input when we go to parse.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now, of course I could have typed in the whole grammar like this to begin with,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
but that would have been messy and error-prone and harder to read.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I did myself a favor imagining the language I wanted and writing in that language,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
then figuring out how to get it into something the computer can understand.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now all I have to do is write this function grammar that translates from this format into this format.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Fortunately, it's really easy to write this function. Here the whole thing is. Here's what I've done.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I've initialized the grammar that I'm going to produce to be the empty dictionary.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Then I've gone through the whole description--the description is the input--

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and split it up by lines.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
For each line I've split up each line by the arrow into left-hand side an a right-hand side.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Then for each right-hand side I've split that up, using the or sign,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
into a list of alternatives of one or more.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Then I've just said let's assign to the left-hand side--expression or term--a tuple,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
because that's what we're using for alternatives of the map of splitting up each alternative.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The alternative here would be a string.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It would be the string of everything starting from term and ending with expression.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Then I just mapped the split function to it to split it up into individual atoms.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
That would split it up into a three-element list--term, plus or minus, and expression.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
That's all I need.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
This is a description of the grammar format, immediately implements it, and builds up a dictionary for us.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I should say I've used here this utility function "split."

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It's just like string.split, except when it splits things up it strips the white space

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
from each of the pieces.
