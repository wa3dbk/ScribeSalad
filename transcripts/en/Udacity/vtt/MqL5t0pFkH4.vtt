The HTML spec says that unrecognized input types are to be

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.600
treated as text. So, new input types will still work even if

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.490
they're not supported on a particular browser. They'll just function like text

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.520
inputs. Not quite as useful, but still functional. Graceful degradation at work.
