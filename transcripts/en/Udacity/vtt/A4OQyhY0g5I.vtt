00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.810
Now, many of you, because this is
a graduate course intended for computer

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.340
science, I'm going to assume you've seen
some form of an algorithms class, and

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.360
you may have heard that there's
something called a graph cut algorithm.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.150
And a graph cut algorithm
does exactly what you think.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.130
It cuts a graph.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.870
So here I've got a graph and
the idea was originally it had lots of

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.960
connections in it, and when I'm all
done, I've decided to break this graph

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.590
on those four links to create two s,
different graphs, a and b.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.740
And they're totally d, disconnected, so

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.330
those would be two
segments in our image.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.190
And the idea is that the cost
of a cut is quite simply just

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.750
the cost of all of
the segments that you broke.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.090
So that's what this thing shows you,
here.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.430
I take, for all of the,
if there's a p in a, and q in b,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.360
and I've separated a and b.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.610
What's the cost between all of those?

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.490
And a graph cut would give you
a segmentation of the image.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.150
So the question becomes, what is a good
graph cut, and how do you find one?

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.130
So there are algorithms called min-cut
algorithms, sometimes called max-flow

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.200
because they're they're duels of each
other, they're the same, that allow you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.646
to find that segmentation in
a relatively not too complex a matter.

00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:16.400
Fast min-cut algorithms exist.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.350
So the original min-cut Fulkem,
Fulk, Fulk and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.670
Fulkerson, you may have learned there
are subsequent more rapid ones.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.510
We're not going to go into those here.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.220
All you need to know is that you can
go to your local algorithm store and

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.570
buy yourself a good
graph cut algorithm and

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.810
the more you can spend the faster
a graph cut algorithm you can get.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.370
And the idea is that,
that would partition your graph.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.300
A problem though,
if we just use min-cut for

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.550
doing segmentation, is that
min-cut by definition is going to

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.670
try to pull out little segments that
have as few connections as possible.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.540
So what it tends to do, is it tends to
pull off very small little segments.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.890
because by definition a little segment
will only connect to a small number of

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.050
other nodes.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.800
So, really what you want to do is
you want to something a little bit

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.090
smarter than that.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.680
In an intent,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.290
in fact, what you want to do is what's
referred to as normalized cuts.
