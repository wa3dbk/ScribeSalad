00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's write out one way to do it together.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're definitely going to need an if statement to tell the difference

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
between whether state is already in chart sub index and whether it's not.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let me do the hard case first.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'll check to see if that state is in the list returned by chart bracket index.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If it's not, we have to add it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
One way to add an element to a list is to make a list out of it

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and use list concatenation or list append.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Here, whatever chart[index] used to contain, we add that to the list containing just state,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and we store the result.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In this case we return true.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Otherwise it's already there, so I should not do any updates.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'll just return false immediately.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The key tricks--I have to check to see if state is in chart sub index,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and if it's not, I have to make a bigger list that contains all the old stuff we used to have

00:00:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
plus the new state we're being asked to add.
