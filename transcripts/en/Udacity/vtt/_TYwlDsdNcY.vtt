An easier model for rendering is the Pinhole Camera. With a Pinhole camera, you

00:00:05.168 --> 00:00:09.170
put a piece of photographic film at one end of a box and poke a hole in the

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.216
other end, then you cover up this hole. You do this in the dark so that the film

00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:16.894
was not exposed to light. Of course, just about no ones uses film anymore, but

00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:20.720
I'll assume you have some idea how camera film works. To take a photo, you point

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.672
the camera, open the hole for a short amount of time. Then go back to the dark

00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:28.336
room and develop the film. With the Pinhole camera, the light coming in from one

00:00:28.336 --> 00:00:32.140
direction is detected by a single location on the flat rectangle of the film.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.358
Put these differing light contributions together, and you get a picture. Most

00:00:36.358 --> 00:00:40.072
cameras work the same way. They may have more complex lense systems, but they

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:44.049
gather light in a similar manner with the image projected behind the lense. We

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:47.769
often simplify and think of our eyes as elaborate cameras that send images

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.355
directly to our brains. It's better to think about the eye as part of our visual

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:55.889
system, since ultimately it's the brains interpretation of the data that

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:56.423
matters.
