00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this question, Alice has created a circuit with onion router 1 and onion router 2,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and she wants to extend that to include onion router 3 and onion router 4.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And the question is, how many more total messages are transmitted?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Count one for every time a message is sent over a single-hop link.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
To help you get started, the first two messages are Alice sends a message to onion router 1

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to relay on c1 where c1 equals circuit 1

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to relay on circuit 2 to extend to onion router 3 and continue on with the message.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Onion router 1 sends a message to onion router 2 to relay on circuit 2 to extend to onion router 3.

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And so on. So how many messages do we need?
