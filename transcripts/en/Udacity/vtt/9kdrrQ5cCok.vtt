00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.469
Here are some guidelines about the review process itself. First off,

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.540
spread out the reviews over time.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.360
Performance degrades if reviews are too concentrated. A practical limit for

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.120
the duration of a review is the smaller of 250 lines of code, or 2 hours of,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.920
of artifact reviewing. Each type of review should have its own criterion for

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.100
thoroughness, which should be determined in advance of the meeting.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.310
You can, treat the review as a go, no go decision activity. That is,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.170
the review meeting should end with a decision about whether or

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.280
not the artifact is ready for the next stage of the development process.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.500
In fact, some organizations require the reviewers to sign off on

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.270
the acceptability of the artifact, thereby improving accountability.
