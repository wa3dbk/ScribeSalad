00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.030
So what is this user
preferred text size anyway?

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.530
Well, for

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.960
accessibility purposes Android allows
users to customize their font size.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.980
Users that have trouble reading
text can increase their font size.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.210
You can normally find this option in
the display settings on your phone or

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.350
tablet under font size.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.730
It's often also available through
the accessibility settings.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.350
With scale-independent pixels,
16 sp is exactly the same as

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.440
16 dp when the user's font
size is normal or 100%.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.070
But when the user's font size is large,
for example 125%,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.300
16 sp will translate to 20 dp or
1.25 times 16.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.770
Using sp units will make for
a better experience for

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.780
people with impaired eyesight.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.660
You'll be saving someone the frustration
of downloading your awesome app,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.410
only to find that they
can't read the text.
