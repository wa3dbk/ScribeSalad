00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.370
So we just recapped different
layout managers and

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.050
looked at how you'd use various layouts
together to create some example screens.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.570
As you probably noticed we started using
these circles and buttons and toolbars.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.900
Let's start diving a little deeper into
what some of those elements were and

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.320
why they keep appearing
all over the place.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.040
Now each application is
an individual snowflake

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.090
with different content and goals.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.100
Just because they're unique though, it
doesn't mean that we should force users

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.300
to learn new conventions
to operate them.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.240
By following some established
patterns of the platform, you

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.320
can accelerate your users understanding
of the app, making it feel intuitive.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.370
Imagine if every model of car had
a different layout of the pedals,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.080
the steering wheel and the levers.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.090
While you might be able to
learn one model you'd have

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.065
a hard time moving to another.

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:46.390
Your UI is exactly the same.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.880
By following some conventions users
can quickly get in and drive your app.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.570
Here is some of the most
prevalent patterns used on Android

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.690
to organize your interface and
navigate around it.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.360
A Toolbar is a horizontal bar,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.830
which provides a standard way to
present titles and actions in your lab.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.400
It's made up of a navigation
area on the left, a title area,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.060
and the menu of actions.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.070
It's a very flexible widget, and
each of these function is optional.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.460
A nice feature is that the toolbar can
show actions either directly within

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.240
the tool bar, or they can be collapsed
under a sub menu known as an overflow

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.110
if there isn't enough room.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.000
And it will base it's decision
on whether there's enough room

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.540
to show everything.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.116
Tapping the overflow item itself yields
this overflow menu of additional actions

00:01:31.116 --> 00:01:32.500
you can take.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.780
The toolbar itself is a view group,
so you can add children to it.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.800
For example,
I could add a Spinner Control

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.450
as a child view to provide some
kind of navigational control.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.960
Now, toolbars are used
extensively in Android.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.340
So they're very recognizable to your
users, and a common place to look for

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.820
actions or present them.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.100
They generally use a standard
height which varies by screen size,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.090
and can be queried using
the actionBarSize Free match P.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.350
They're also a great place
to embed your brand's color.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.820
Next, the App bar.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.340
The app bar is just
a special case of a toolbar,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.330
where it's placed at
the very top of the screen.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.800
As such, the title field often
provides a screen title.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.090
And the navigation icon provides access
to screen level navigation options.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.540
The app bar often uses an extended
height to provide more space for

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.015
branding or to contain a header image.

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:29.795
In this case it's using multiples
of the standard height.

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:31.295
Next up Tabs.

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:32.825
Tabs let you organize and

00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:35.925
navigate to different sections
within your screen or app.

00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:39.080
On Android, tabs always appear
at the top of the screen.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.710
And you can switch between them
using a horizontal swipe gesture.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.640
Generally, they sit on the same surface
as your app bar, if you're using one.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.520
Now, tabs can be a great way to
provide the main way of navigating

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.138
about your app.

00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:54.027
Or providing sub-navigation if
you're using a different top-level

00:02:54.027 --> 00:02:55.190
navigation construct.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.940
Such as a Navigation Drawer.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.700
Now a Navigation Drawer is a panel
that slides in from the left of

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.010
the screen and it contains
the top level navigation options

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.050
to different parts of your application.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.590
The drawer itself can be
divided into sections and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.520
frequently provides access to account
information here in this top area.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.800
Now, the drawer is closely associated
with the so-called hamburger icon.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.930
This three-line icon in your toolbar.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.070
Either pressing this or

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.910
dragging from the left edge of
your device will open the drawer.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.490
The drawer can work well if you
have a number of different sections

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.970
that you want to provide
quick navigation to

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.970
without taking up persistent
space on every screen.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.340
However, if you don't need this, say if
you only have a few sections to navigate

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.390
between, then a different pattern,
like tabs

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.200
might be more relevant as they're
going to be more obvious to your users.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.440
It's also important to use restraint and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.680
thoughtfully select items to
put in the navigation drawer.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.160
It shouldn't become a dumping ground for
all the things.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.190
Android also has pretty common
patterns around Scrolling and Paging.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.920
Users are typically comfortable
with scrolling vertically to see

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.620
more information on the screen.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.080
Horizontal scrolling is less common,
especially with text content,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.220
as it can be frustrating to read.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.920
More common is to use a horizontal
gesture to page through content.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.640
So, each gesture takes you to one
screen page, back or forward.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.860
So for example,
if you're reading emails or

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.089
news stories,
then it's a very useful pattern.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:21.615
Horizontal Paging is especially common
for a details view launched from a list,

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:26.125
where you have a mental model of what
the next page of items might be.

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.765
Note, that as we just
covered in the tab section,

00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:31.650
horizontal swipes should
change pages between tabs.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.130
So the effort is kind of
incompatible to use both tabs and

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.310
horizontally paid content.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.570
Another extremely common pattern
on Android is List to Details,

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.370
where you would show a list
of individual items and

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.040
clicking on one would take you
to a subsequent detail screen.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.020
You've probably used this 100 times.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.430
Such as viewing your contacts or
reading news stories for example.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.510
A variation on this pattern
is to show both the list and

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.710
detail sections on the same
screen on larger devices.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.040
So here these two screen would be
separate on a small device and

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.220
brought together on a larger device.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.540
Showing just a list on a large
screen can look awkward and

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.480
leave a lot of empty space.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.440
Additionally, showing both items at once
can allow you to obtain more context

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.523
about the activity you're performing and
prevents what we call Pogosticking.

00:05:19.523 --> 00:05:22.561
Where the user is forced to go
into details and back up, and

00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:24.000
into a details and back up.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.500
We'll go into much more
detail on other patents for

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.900
larger screens in lesson five.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.440
Now it's absolutely okay to
deviate from these patents if and

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.500
when it makes sense for
your specific use case.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.670
These are patents after all,
not strict rules.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.390
But make sure you're doing so for

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.000
good reasons, as you'll be asking your
users to learn a bespoke interaction.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.530
The phrase I like to use here
is deviate with purpose.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.210
Picking an application's structure and

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.860
navigation scheme depends on
the content in your application.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.150
A good exercise is to sketch out
an Entity Relationship Diagram.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.180
This shows the objects
in your application and

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.320
how they relate to each other.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.520
Once you understand this, you can pick
an application structure to match.
