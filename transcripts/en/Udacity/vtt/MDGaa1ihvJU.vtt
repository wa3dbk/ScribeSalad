00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.287
So, there are two main scientific theories of human intelligence, but before we

00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:09.490
get into those theories, let's remember what scientific theories are all about.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.470
Scientific theories explain and organize the known evidence on a given topic.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.155
It's important to remember, though, that good scientific theories, are always

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:23.335
open to change, based on that scientific evidence. So, scientific theories make

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:28.500
testable predictions, and we test those predictions, with empirical studies.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.820
The results of those studies, then, lead scientists to either confirm,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.044
disconfirm, or modify, their theories. So now I'm going to send you over to

00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:40.780
Lauren to talk about the two theories of human intelligence.
