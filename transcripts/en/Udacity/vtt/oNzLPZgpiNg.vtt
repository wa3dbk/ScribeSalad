Now that you've worked with constructors a little bit, let's do an example of

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.905
constructing some rectangles. We want to initialize the variables box, and

00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:10.570
box2, with two rectangles of equal dimensions that touch each other at a

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.960
corner. I'm going to give you a few more specifications. I want box to have a

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.390
width of 20 and a height of 30. I want box's top left pixel to be at x is 60,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.570
and y is 90. And if this is the frist box, I want box2 to touch it at this

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.700
bottom right corner. Boot up BlueJ and try this for yourself. Then paste the

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.450
code for the two boxes into the editor that we give you. Don't worry if too

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.835
much if BlueJ isn't working, you can just the Audacity editor we're providing.

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:44.570
And here's a quick hint, if you find that your boxes aren't showing up, it

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.104
might be because you have to remember to call the draw method.
