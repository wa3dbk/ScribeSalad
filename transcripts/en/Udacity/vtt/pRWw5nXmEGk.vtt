00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.910
Instead of applying a texture to a surface we can apply a texture to represent

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.080
the world itself. In the distance are clouds in all directions. The way this

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.010
illusion is done is with a sky box. The idea is to put the viewer in the center

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.428
of a box and put the environment on the walls, floor, and ceiling. Doing this

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:18.158
reminds me a bit of The Truman Show, where Truman's world is highly limited and

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:20.846
he runs his ship into, well, I don't want to spoil anything if you haven't seen

00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:25.002
it. The key is that you have to be careful to not let the viewer get too close

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:29.166
to the sky so that he doesn't figure out it's just an illusion. If I turn on

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:32.712
the wire frame for the cube, the trick is revealed. You can see the walls of

00:00:32.712 --> 00:00:36.754
the box. Without the wire frame, the illusion is seamless. If the viewer moves

00:00:36.754 --> 00:00:39.777
around, the center of the box moves with them. In this way, there's no

00:00:39.777 --> 00:00:43.897
distortion as the view of the walls never changes. This type of texture is

00:00:43.897 --> 00:00:47.791
called a cube map. It's made of six images that form the cube faces. The viewer

00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:52.230
is always placed at the center of the cube. For example, here's the frustum for

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.022
the top of the cube, the plus Y face. The cube shape is not required. It's

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:58.416
possible to have other geometries, such as a hemispherical dome around the

00:00:58.416 --> 00:01:02.117
scene. Whatever the shape, our eyes can't see the Z buffer, so can't tell the

00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:07.225
sky is only, say, 100 meters away. Sky boxes are typically used for star fields

00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:11.180
or, well, the sky, for times when you're not near the ground. Alternately, you

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.770
can simply make the surrounding sky box a part of the scene such as shown here.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.620
Real geometry has the advantage that it can receive shadows from the object.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.960
The main rule is that you want to make sure that nothing pokes through the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.509
walls of the sky box itself. Oh, and one more thing, you definitely want to set

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.498
the far distance of your camera so that it encompasses the sky box itself,

00:01:29.498 --> 00:01:32.449
otherwise it will be clipped out.
