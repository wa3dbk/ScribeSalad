00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.620
So the first requirement is definitely pertinent. Members of the gym shall

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.740
be able to access their training programs. It's pretty normal for members of

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.710
the gym to have a training program. And therefore, the system should allow

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.900
them to access them. Similarly for the second one. The system shall be

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.450
able to read member cards. Normally when you get into a gym

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.420
if you have a member card, you'll have to either show it to

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.010
somebody, or nowadays swipe it, and so the system should be able to

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.410
recognize the customer given the card.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.710
The third requirement is probably not pertinent,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.090
because I cannot think of any meaningful case in which the system

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.729
should know what is the members' commute time. The fourth requirement, personal

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.750
trainers shall be able to add clients, is also probably pertinent. Assuming

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.870
that we have personal trainers in the gym, and they should be

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.710
able to get clients, to work with the clients of the gym,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.140
and therefore, they should be able to add them as their clients

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.620
to the system. And finally, the last requirement, the list of members

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.800
shall be stores as a linked list. This is really something about

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.130
the how, more than the what. And therefore, for what we say before

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.720
is probably not a pertinent requirement, so we're not going to mark this one.
