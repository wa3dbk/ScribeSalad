00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.968
Our point of intersection is right here. Because this point lies on the line y

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.073
equals 19, we already know that its y-coordinate must be 19. Its x-coordinate we

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:18.370
can find by just tracing this down to the x-axis, straight below the point. And

00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:24.842
that is 5. So, our point of intersection is 5,19. The x-coordinate here is 5, so

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:31.283
x must equal 5. Let's check this in our original equation. We started off with

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:37.179
the equation 3 x plus 4 equals 19. Let's plug in our x value to see if this

00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:43.261
works. On the left-hand side, we'll have 3 times 5 plus 4, which simplifies to

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:49.407
19. The right-hand side has no variables, so there's nothing to change, and we

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:56.014
can just write 19. Sure enough, 19 equals 19. So, we're good. x equals 5 is the

00:00:56.026 --> 00:00:58.001
correct answer.
