00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.428
We've been working with quadratic inequalities and clearly linear inequalities

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:08.588
before that, but a lot of the techniques that we've learned to use can actually

00:00:08.588 --> 00:00:12.685
be used in a number of other kinds of situations too. Now we're going to take a

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:16.781
second to talk about rational inequalities, which are things like this, for

00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:21.023
example. The quantity 2x minus 18 divided by the quantity x minus 4 is greater

00:00:21.023 --> 00:00:25.533
than or equal to 0. The reason this is called a rational inequality is because

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:30.157
the left side over here is an example of a rational expression. Remember when we

00:00:30.157 --> 00:00:34.573
talked about rational numbers early Julie pointed out that the word ratio is

00:00:34.573 --> 00:00:38.846
inside the word rational. So while a rational number is just the ratio of 2

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:43.062
integers. We will remember the denominator is not allowed to be 0, and rational

00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:46.787
expression seems to be pretty closely related. It's just the ratio of two

00:00:46.787 --> 00:00:50.722
polynomials. And like with rational numbers, the denominator is not equal to

00:00:50.722 --> 00:00:51.070
zero.
