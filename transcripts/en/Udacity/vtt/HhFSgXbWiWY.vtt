00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Since 3 coloring is an NP and SAT is NP complete, meaning that it's NP hard,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
it has to be the case that we could use SAT to solve 3 coloring problems,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but it's actually a little bit interesting to see how you might do that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So let's take a look, here's a simple little graph and one, two, three, four nodes, four edges

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and imagine that we want to try to 3-color this graph.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What we're going to do is we're going to create a ??? formula that is satisfiable

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
if and only if this graph is 3 colorable, so that it's really the same problem,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the way that we're going to do that is we're going to create a bunch of boolean variables,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
12 of them to be exact, corresponding to each of the four nodes--a, b, c, and d,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and for each node, we'll a boolean variable saying whether that node is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
red or green or yellow, the three colors.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
For example, assigning the variable a red to true, a green to false and a yellow to false

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
means that we're coloring the a node red, and so once we've assigned true values,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
trues and falses to all 12 of these variables that corresponds perhaps to some coloring.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
In fact, you have to be a little bit careful here because if we assigned two of these to true,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do in a boolean formula, you can't really interpret this

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
as a coloring except for may be a is orange, but that's not really allowed.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What we have to do now is given these 12 variables, we have to create a formula that is true

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
if and only if it corresponds to a valid coloring, meaning that both exactly one of each of these

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
triples the variables are true and there's no collisions--

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
for example, we can't have a colored red and b colored red because they're connected by an edge.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
They will have to be different if they're connected by an edge.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The formula for this can be generated automatically and I'll give you glimpse at it.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Here it is, at least one version of it, and it's a little bit weird and complicated,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
but it actually falls into some nice structures.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.000
First there's a bunch of logic to say that it should be the case that say--

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the a red, a green, and a yellow variables, one of them should be true.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If they're all false, then it's not telling us what color a should be, and it also has to be case

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that no pair of colors can be true for a given node.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It can't be the case that both a red is true and a green is true, so that's bad.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
There has to be at least one true and not the case that both a is both red and green

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
not the case that a is both red and yellow and not the case that both a is green and yellow,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and we do that for all four of the nodes and that tells us that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
there's a meaningful color assignment to the nodes.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Then we have some additional clauses that say--

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
what can't be the case that a is red and b is red at the same time.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It can't be the case that a is green and b is green at the same time and it can't be the case

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
that a is yellow and b is yellow at the same time.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
What is that saying, that saying the color--whatever the color happens to be--

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
for a it can't match the color of b and that's because they share an edge in the graph.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
For each of the edges in the graph, we have three of these statements to rule out

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
all possible color matches, so there's three of these for one edge, two edge, three edge--

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
there's four edges in the graph so we have four blocks of these.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
In this formula now as a whole has a satisfying assignment, has an assignment that makes

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
this whole expression true if and only if there's a coloring, a 3 coloring of that graph.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now, in this case, I generated this formula by carefully looking at the graph

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and going back and forth in making the formula, but you can automate this idea

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
by just generalizing the way that I did this here.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Why don't you think about how to do that and I'll ask you a question

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
just to make sure that you got the idea.
