00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.430
Here is Acme's vocabulary. Some of it should be similar to you from the Garland

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.920
and Shaw paper that you read, and terms that we have been using to describe

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.367
architecture so far. First off is components, these are computational elements

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:17.860
and data stores. Along with them come connectors, which are communication and

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.350
coordination among. The components. Ports are com, component interfaces,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.680
possibly including protocols. And roles are similarly connector interfaces. So

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.290
you can imagine plugging together components and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.020
connectors using their their po, ports and roles. The Acme term for

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.490
configuration is a system. It is the set of components and

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.130
connectors you have for a particular architecture you're describing,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.010
the actual configuration specified via what Acme calls attachments of the ports

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.220
to the roles. I'll also be talking about representations, which is Acme's way

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.000
of describing hierarchical decomposition across multiple levels of abstraction.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.390
And rep-maps which are specific bindings between those levels of abstractions.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.660
Those seven terms constitute all that Acme

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.720
requires of you to understand in terms of building architectural descriptions.
