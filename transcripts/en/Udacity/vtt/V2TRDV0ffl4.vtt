00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.919
Let's talk a little bit about the Bayer filter on the sensor.

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:06.209
So in essence, a Bayer filter is nothing else but

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:11.100
different types of color filters that are above the photo diodes.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.340
And most of the time you'll actually see two greens and a blue and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.430
a red, so this would be the four region here, that represents one pixel.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.650
Four another here, that represents another pixel, four here and so on.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.470
Of course, depending on the convention of the Bayer filter used,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.145
sometimes you might have two reds and a green and a,

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:37.580
a blue, and also two blues and a green and a red.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.620
Depends again on it, but

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.060
knowing exactly what is the Bayer filter is essential because we need to

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.300
know this to have to compute and then, come up with a final image.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.920
Basically what happens with the Bayer filter is each one of them let's only

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.490
a specific light through.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.430
So when the light is hitting the red, basically, the blue and

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.420
green are prevented from going through.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.850
Red goes through.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.975
Same thing with green.

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:00.370
Just the green goes through.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.490
Same thing with blue, only the bo, blue goes through.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.200
So, in essence, we create three different patterns.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.590
Of course the photo diodes then store the intensity for each and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.620
every one of them.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.360
But, this coding scheme,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.940
pretty much let's us know which one of the bins is actually blue, green, or red.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.820
Then of course it's the combination of these three channels that gives us

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.690
the final image, and this is the one that we need to then decode and

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.800
save for our final things.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.100
One of the questions that's important is,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.660
how is the raw input in a Bayer mosaic format converted to an image?

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.650
What's the process to be able to then get basically the RGB color values,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.730
that is, the RGB as we have discussed when we

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.900
talked about the image processing pipeline, the three channels separated out?
