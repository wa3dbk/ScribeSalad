00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.580
Now that we understand reductions,
we're ready to use them to help us prove

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.130
decidability and
even more interestingly, undecidability.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.430
Suppose that we have a language
A that's reducible to B, and

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.020
let's say that I want to know whether
some string x is in the language A.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.520
Well, if there's a decider for
B then I'm in luck.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.110
I can use the reduction,
which is a computable function,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.980
remember, that takes in one string and
outputs another.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.100
I just need to feed in x and
take the output and

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.990
feed that into the decider for B.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.965
If B accepts, then I know that
x is in A and if B rejects,

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:40.760
then I know that it isn't.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.000
This works because by the definition
of a reduction, x is in a, if and

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.120
only if, r of x is in b and
by the definition of a decider,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.210
this is true if and
only if, d accepts r of x.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.470
Therefore the output of d
tells me whether x is in a.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.120
If I can figure out whether
a string is in b or not.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.240
Then by the properties of the reduction,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.590
this also let's me figure out whether
the original string x was in A.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.750
That means that we can say that
the composition of the reduction and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.220
the decider for
B is itself a decider for A.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.520
Thus, the fact that A is reducible to
B has four important consequences for

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.820
decidability and recognizability.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.410
The easiest to see is that if B is
decidable, then A is also decidable.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.700
As we've seen, we can just compose
the reduction with the decider for B.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.935
The same logic also works if
there's only a recognizer for B.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:45.099
If we input a string X that is in A,

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.302
then R of X will be in B, so
the recognizer will accept.

00:01:50.302 --> 00:01:55.229
And if we input a string that is not
in A, then R of X will not be in B, so

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.525
the recognizer will not accept.

00:01:58.525 --> 00:01:59.950
It might loop.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.690
But we know it won't accept and that's
good enough for our recognizer for A.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.520
The other two consequences are just
the counter positives of these.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.670
If A is undecidable, then this
composition of the reduction and

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.060
the decider can't be a decider for A.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.770
Since we're assuming that there is
a reduction, the only possibility

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.100
is that the decider for B doesn't exist,
hence B is undecidable.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.080
And the same logic holds for
the unrecognizability of A and B.
