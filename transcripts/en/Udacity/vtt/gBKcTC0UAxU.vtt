00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.134
In fact most IDEs are extensible through the use of

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:06.158
plug-ins. And by the way, note that plug-ins might be

00:00:06.158 --> 00:00:09.326
called differently on different platforms. For example, if you're using

00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:12.970
a Microsoft Visual Studio, plug-ins are normally called add-ins, but

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.598
the concept is more or less the same. So, what

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.555
is a plug-in? Well, let's imagine our IDE to be

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:22.320
this box. A plug-in is additional functionality that you can

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.430
actually plug into this box so that this box starts

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.830
offering more features to the user. For example, you

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.850
can add to Eclipse the Checkstyle plug-in. Which, paraphrasing the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.950
Checkstyle website, helps you ensure that your Java code

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.890
complies with a set of coding standards by inspecting the

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.690
code and pointing out items that deviate from a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.870
defined set of coding rules. Again, this is a functionality

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.330
the core of Eclipse doesn't have. You can add

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.600
the Checkstyle plug-in, and this functionality will become available in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.840
the IDE. Another example of plug-in is the EGit plug-in which

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.660
adds support for the Git version control system in Eclipse. And

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.290
actually this is something that we'll cover in detail, we'll have

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.150
a demo, and we will actually use it throughout the class, so

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.018
I'm not going to say anything more about the EGit plug-in for

00:01:07.018 --> 00:01:09.300
now. But again, what the plug-in will do is to add

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.220
the Git functionality to Eclipse. A functionality that is not in

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.110
the core of Eclipse and that is available to the user after

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.181
you add the plug-in.
