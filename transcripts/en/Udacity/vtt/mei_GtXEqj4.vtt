00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.890
So essentially, what the reference count and

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.170
the existence guarantee is giving you is, it

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.360
is giving you the same facility, without

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.300
doing the hierarchical locking, that was what we

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.820
really wanted. What we really wanted in

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.000
this hierarchical locking is the existence guarantee of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.260
this process object to guarantee the integrity

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.410
of this object. We're getting that. We're getting

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.790
that by associating a reference count and making

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.320
sure that this particular object is not gotten

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.470
rid of until the reference count goes to

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.180
zero. So we're achieving the effect of hierarchical

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.107
locking without losing concurrency for operations that can

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:44.410
go on in parallel. Of course if these

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.880
page faults for T1 and T2 are accessing

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.610
the same region of memory, you have no choice

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.160
except to go to the same region object. But there

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.280
again, this is something that the operating system can monitor

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.370
over time and see if, even though it is the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.712
same region, maybe this region itself can be carved up into

00:01:03.712 --> 00:01:07.470
sub regions and promote concurrency. And the limit, you can

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.320
have a region for every virtual page, but that might

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.190
be too much, right? And that's the reason that you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.040
don't want to have a detonation of a page table into

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.130
such a fine grain partition. But you might want to think about what is the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.650
right granularity to promote concurrency for services like this to go on

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.530
in the multiprocessor. So coming back again

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.560
to the hierarchical locking. The key to

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.690
avoiding hierarchical locking in Tornado is to

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.910
make the locking encapsulated in individual objects.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.300
There's no hierarchical locking. Locking is encapsulated in

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.440
the individual object and you're reducing the scope

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.200
of the lock to that particular object. So

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.500
if there's a replica of this region, then

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.910
a lock for a particular replica is only

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.870
limited to that replica. And not across all

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.630
the replicas of a particular region. That's important,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.700
it reduces the scope of the lock. And therefore

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.530
it limits the contention for the lock. But of course it is l incumbent on the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.740
service provider to make sure that if a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.450
particular region is replicated, then the integrity of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.430
that replication is guaranteed by the operating system

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.050
through a protective procedure called mechanism that keeps

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.240
these regions consistent with one another because you

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.740
made a replica of that. Even if the hardware

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.290
provides cache coherence, there's no way to guarantee that these replicas

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.710
will be consistent. Because they are dealing with different physical memories,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.720
and therefore, it is the responsibility of the operating system to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.230
make sure that these regions are kept consistent with one another.
