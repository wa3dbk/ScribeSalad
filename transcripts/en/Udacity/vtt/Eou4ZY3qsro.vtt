The baby spent nearly all of its time with this mother, and would even cling to

00:00:03.626 --> 00:00:08.550
this mother to lean over to feed from the wire mother. This really showed us

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.362
that food and nutrition aren't the only things that go into attachment. We need

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:16.998
a warm secure caregiver also to form an attachment. So remember then we see

00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:20.898
that attachment is not just about food and nutrition. In fact other studies

00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:24.580
have shown that animals will choose a fake mother that resembles their own.
