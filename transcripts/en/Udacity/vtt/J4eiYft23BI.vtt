00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.278
You've now seen two loops, the while loop and the for loop. And now, you have

00:00:04.278 --> 00:00:10.264
choices and which loop to take, and choices aren't always easy. So, let's look

00:00:10.264 --> 00:00:18.529
at a typical problem. Let's say we have $10,000, and we get 10% interest. And

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.345
we want to know what happens to our nest egg over a period of 30 years. Which

00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:27.444
loop should we take? Now, in this case, what's going to drive our decision is

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:32.744
the fact that we know we want to do something 30 times. And when you know how

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:37.758
often you want to do it, then the for loop is what you want to choose. Over

00:00:37.758 --> 00:00:42.966
here, I've modified our program to do this. Here you see now I've changed the

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:48.334
balance to 10,000. I've changed the interest rate to 10%. And I have now that I

00:00:48.334 --> 00:00:53.396
want 30 years. And then, I just write my loop here, where the year goes from

00:00:53.396 --> 00:00:58.790
one to the numberOfYears, gets incremented every time. And inside here, you

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.500
have the familiar computation of the interest. So, notice that in this loop, I

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.220
know exactly how many times the loop is going to execute, namely, this many

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.631
times, 30 times. Let me run the program. Here you see the output. You see the

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:19.050
interest, and starting at 1, scrolled off at the top, and it went 30 times.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.210
That's the classic case for the for loop. Contrast that with, the example of,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.088
the first program that we had, where we wanted to become a millionaire. At that

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:31.805
point, we used a while loop, because we did not know how many years it was

00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:37.021
going to take for us to achieve our lofty goal. When you don't know how many

00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:41.007
iterations you want, the while loop tends to be the better choice. So, that

00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:45.530
simply is your criterion for decision. Do you know how many times the loop

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.542
runs? You usually choose a for loop. If you don't know, you usually choose a

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:50.560
while loop.
