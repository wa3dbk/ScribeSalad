00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.709
Okay, to solve this problem, first I'm going to reduce my fractions. I want to

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:09.357
take out anything that equals 1. I know 8 goes into 24 and 16, so I'll have an 8

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.690
over 8 in my answer, so let's get rid of that. 24 divided by 8 is 3. and 16

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:18.159
divided by 8 is 2. With 11 and 55, I know they both share a factor of 11. I'm

00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:22.925
going to, to divide that out as well. 11 divided by 11 is 1 and 55 divided by 11

00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:28.075
is 5. So I have 1 times 3 in my numerator, and 2 times 5 in my denominator, so I

00:00:28.087 --> 00:00:31.075
get 3/10. If you said 3/10, nice work.
