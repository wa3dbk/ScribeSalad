00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.402
&gt;&gt; Fantastic. The solution for this is pretty straight forward, based upon what

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:06.699
we've already seen. Firstly, we walk through all the tile set's inside of the

00:00:06.699 --> 00:00:10.496
map object that we've created. For each one of them, we've created a new image,

00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:14.522
set it's on load function, and then set it's source name. Once we are loaded,

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:18.554
effectively we increment the imgLoadCount variable, and then we test if the

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:22.838
imgLoadCount variable is equal to the number of tile sets that could potentially

00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:27.183
occur. So effectively, we are saying that our number of images loaded equal to

00:00:27.183 --> 00:00:31.586
number of images that exist. If so, we can set fully loaded to true. Now, you'll

00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:36.002
notice one annoying little variants of the JSON format for tiled, is that the

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:40.349
image path is actually an absolute path to the file from where the editor and

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:44.871
base file were formed. So effectively, what this is saying is that, given the

00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:49.491
path to tiled, there's some really crazy file path to actually get to the grid's

00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:53.820
master PNG from the source file we're using. So, to properly load that, what

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.242
we'd like to do is strip out all of the other data that's not just the file

00:00:57.242 --> 00:01:00.980
name. And then, append the file name to our data directory. Now, this is because

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.444
our editing environment may be in a different directory structure than our

00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:08.347
production environment that users are actually playing. For grids, we use this

00:01:08.347 --> 00:01:12.373
nifty little regular expression here that allowed us to replace all of the data

00:01:12.373 --> 00:01:16.338
before the final slash with blank characters, giving us the file name for this

00:01:16.338 --> 00:01:20.726
image. We appended that filename to the ../data directory, giving us the source.
