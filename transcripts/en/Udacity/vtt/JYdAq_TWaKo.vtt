00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
Alice is medium happy right now and our goal is, of course, to make her more happy here.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.450
Let's find out if we can find some good rules for pre-processing a graph

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.590
for which we want to solve vertex cover, and the way we're going to do this is--

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.150
I am going to give you a couple of options of potential ideas for pre-processing.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.290
So if there is a vertex with just one neighbor--what I mean by this is there's a vertex like this

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.710
it's connected to another vertex and that vertex is possibly connected to more vertices,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.180
but this one here is only connected to this one.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.690
Should we then, as a pre-processing rule, automatically take this vertex here

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.900
into the vertex cover or should we automatically take this vertex here into the vertex cover,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.060
and as a third case, if we have a vertex that has just two neighbors--so something like this--

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.030
should we then have the pre-processing put these two vertices here into the vertex cover,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.270
which of course would also mean that you do not need to have this one in here.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.290
Please check all of the rules here that are correct--meaning that as required,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.520
they do not affect the solution that we're going to find in the end.

00:01:06.520 --> 99:59:59.000
Having applied this rule, we can still find the smallest possible vertex cover for the whole graph.
