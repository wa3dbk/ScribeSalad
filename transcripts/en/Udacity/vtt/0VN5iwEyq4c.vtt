00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.710
Okay, now that we have some tools,
we can dive into basic algorithms.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.809
Let's say you have an array
sorted in numerical order and

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.770
you want to see if a number that
you have exists in this array.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.189
If you start at the front and
check every number in the array,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.820
the time could be O(n) if
your number is really big.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.270
The same happens if you
start at the other end.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.960
You could have a really small number and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.460
it might end up taking
linear time in worst case.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.990
However, we could do a cool trick
here that takes advantage of the fact

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.110
that you have a sorted array.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.800
Rather than starting at the end,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.540
let's say you started in
the middle of the array.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.290
You could say, is my number bigger or
smaller than the one in the middle.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.970
Since my number is bigger,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.640
I know that it'll have to be in
the second half of the array.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.880
Now I don't even have to search
the first half of the array.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.200
The best thing about this strategy is
that you can make the same assumption

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.800
again, just on the second
half of the array.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.360
Check the middle element and
then move forward from there.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.768
My number is still bigger than
the middle of this array, so

00:01:03.768 --> 00:01:06.185
now I only have to
check the last element.

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:07.405
And now we're at the end.

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:13.160
We've checked 19 and 29, two numbers
side by side, and we still don't see 25.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.395
Thus, we can conclude 25
does not exist in our array.

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:18.155
Guess what?

00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:19.915
You just learned an algorithm.

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:23.635
An algorithm is really just a high
level description of a trick for

00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:25.550
solving a problem.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.505
This one happens to be
called binary search.
