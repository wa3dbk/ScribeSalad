00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.820
We'll be looking at messaging and
document standards next.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.980
But both of these rest on the data
standards we've just discussed.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.550
To see that,
go to the URL in the instructor's notes,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.800
it will take you to the HealthVault
Developer site to access a sample

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.645
of a CCD,
an XML formatted patient summary.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.220
Find the Problems section and use it
to answer the questions that follow.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.320
Note that the problems
are represented in three ways.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.220
First, in easily human-readable text,
next in a table format that could

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.140
readily be viewed as part of a web page,
and third, the same problems are wrapped

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.750
in a considerable amount of
data standards nomenclature.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.960
Each of these begins with an entry
type code and ends with /entry.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.240
Study what's between these to
see how complex HL7 has become.
