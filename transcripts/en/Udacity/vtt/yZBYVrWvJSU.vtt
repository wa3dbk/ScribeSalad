00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.780
So why do we care about Virtualization?

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.520
Well, first it enables consolidation.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.150
And consolidation is this ability to run
multiple virtual machines, with their

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.580
operating systems and applications,
on a single physical platform.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.920
Consolidation then leads to
improved cost efficiency.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.790
With pure machines, with less space,
potentially with fewer admins, and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.240
with fewer electrical bills, we will be
able to run the same kind of workload.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.630
So consolidation delivers benefits
because it allows us to decrease costs,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.320
and also to improve
the manageability of the system.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.740
In addition with Virtualization,
once the operating system

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.920
in its applications are nicely
encapsulated in a VM, and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.760
decoupled from the actual
physical hardware.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.320
It becomes more easy to migrate
the OS in the applications

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.980
from one physical machine to
another physical machine.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.030
Or even to copy and

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.230
clone them onto multiple physical
machines at the same time.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.350
As a result, Virtualization leads
to mechanisms that are useful

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.290
in order to provide greater
availability of the services.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.330
Like, for instance, if we have
an increase in the load, we can just,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.620
create multiple VMs and
address that issue.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.650
So, increase the availability
of the system.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.420
And also to provide solutions
that improve the reliability.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.510
For instance,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.890
if we detect that a particular hardware
node is getting hot and likely will

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.940
fail, we can just migrate those VMs
onto some other physical nodes.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.380
There are other benefits
to Virtualization.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.600
For instance because the OS and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.600
the applications are nicely
encapsulated in a virtual machine.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.320
It becomes more easy to contain any
kinds of bugs, or any kinds of malicious

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.180
behavior, to those resources that are
available to the virtual machine only,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.470
and not to potentially affect
the entire hardware system.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.400
Speaking of debugging, in particular,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.145
Virtualization has delivered
some other benefits,

00:02:06.145 --> 00:02:11.430
that it has become a very important
platform for operating systems research.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.570
It let's systems researchers quickly
introduce new operating system feature

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.450
and has them in the OS that's
encapsulated in the VM.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.830
And then they have ability to more
quickly view the effects of that and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.350
debug it as opposed to
a more traditional cycle,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.980
which would have included hardware
restarts of the machines and

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.160
then searches through the log files or
the error files, etc.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.930
Virtualization is also useful because
it provides affordable support for

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.680
legacy operating systems.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.500
With Virtualization it's no
longer necessary to designate

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.230
some hardware resources for
some older operating system

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.080
just because it's needed to run one
particular application, for instance.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.760
Instead, that legacy OS and applications
can be packaged in a virtual machine and

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.930
then can be co-allocated,
consolidated, on

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.860
the same hardware resources that support
other VMs and other applications.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.860
And there are many other
benefits to Virtualization.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.480
These are some of the key ones, though.
