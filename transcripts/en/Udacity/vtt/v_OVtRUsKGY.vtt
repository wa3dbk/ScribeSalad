00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390
So let's take a look at channel economics, but this time assume you are in

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:13.430
original equipment manufacture and your product becomes some other customer's cost of goods.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:23.980
So let's assume this diagram on the top is a laptop computer sold for a computer reseller channel.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:32.920
And let's say this laptop sells for $3000 and like any other channel,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.090
the end user assumes they get a discount.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.750
The reseller is taking a profit but gee that reseller was actually buying these laptops

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.450
from a master distributor.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:51.750
Now remember, back here the manufacturer of the laptop had their cost of goods

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.460
sometimes abbreviated COGS, which include manufacturing costs, components, etc.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:07.240
And finally, they had their sales costs, their R&amp;D costs, and their general and administrative costs.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.060
And finally, after all that, they make a profit.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.480
So where do you fit? This is just a laptop manufacturer.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:24.260
Assume this is Apple or HP. But in this case, you were a graphics chips supplier to Apple or HP.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.170
And you were just one single component on their motherboard.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.390
Well, if you really think about it, you were fitting in here in their costs of goods.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.880
And now your cost of goods; your sales, general, and administrative costs;

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.980
your profit; and now your reseller costs.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.900
Now, in some cases, you might've been selling directly your parts in to HP or Apple

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.950
and you would not have reseller costs but you would have more direct sales costs.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.560
Remember, this stands for sales, general, and administrative costs and so your profit is miniscule

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.100
compared to what the laptop manufacturer is making but you might be selling millions

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:16.750
of single chips and so that profit is multiplied by that high volume when you OEM a product.
