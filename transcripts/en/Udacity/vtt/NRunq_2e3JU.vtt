So, why is REM sleep important? Well first, we can look for answers in sleep

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:08.835
patterns that occur across the lifetime. We see that REM sleep steadily

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:14.202
decreases from infancy to adulthood. For example, REM goes from about 50% of

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:19.142
total sleep time in infancy, to around 20% of total sleep time in childhood and

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:25.834
adulthood. However, then it increases slightly to around 23% of total sleep

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:31.905
time in old age. So for most of our life, we spend about 20 to 25% of sleep in

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:36.880
REM sleep. Now, if you remember from our previous lessons when we talked about

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.300
REM sleep, REM sleep is associated with neural growth.
