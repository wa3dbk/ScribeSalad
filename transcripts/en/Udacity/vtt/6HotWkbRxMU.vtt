00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.980
This picture that we have here actually
puts a number of different concepts,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.540
in terms of how they're
related to each other, so

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.700
let's just sort of quickly
look at it from two sides.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.850
People who rely on computer systems and
network systems, these are owners

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.640
of the data that's stored, and
the systems where the data is stored.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.110
They deploy those because those
are critical towards the do.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.330
At the same time we know that
there are threat sources and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.520
they're going to pose threats to
the systems that we're talking about.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.790
But one way we deal with
both the threat source and

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.300
a vulnerability that we may
have is deploying defenses.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.650
Owners obviously want
to reduce this risk.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.200
And one way to do that is to deploy
the defenses that we have in place.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.513
And the risk is to the online assets
which are valued by the owners.

00:00:48.513 --> 00:00:51.913
That's sort of the picture
on the legitimate owners and

00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:53.656
what they do in cyberspace.

00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:59.176
In terms of the attackers, or
the malicious actors, threat sources,

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:04.590
they basically increase risk to
these online assets that we have.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.660
And that happens because they exploit
vulnerabilities and launch attacks.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.360
By doing that they wish to profit and
that's the way they do it.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.310
The big picture is sort of the center is
what is of value, who poses a threat and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.950
what do we do to somehow manage
the risk that we have for

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.920
our online assets from
the threat sources.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.660
But the key concepts in cyber security,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.530
this diagram sort of nicely relates
the idea of threats, vulnerabilities,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.460
attacks, cyber risk, and so on,
and how they're all connected.
