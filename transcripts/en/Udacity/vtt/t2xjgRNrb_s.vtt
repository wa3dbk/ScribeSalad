00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.760
Welcome to the first lesson
of computational investing.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.810
My assumption in terms of learning goals

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.930
is that you want to be
a portfolio manager.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.670
What is it you need to know,
and what motivates you?

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.315
It depends on what type of fund you
manage and what your incentives are.

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:21.910
Your motivation is
probably compensation.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.280
And your compensation depends on
the type of fund you manage and

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.950
how well your fund performs.
