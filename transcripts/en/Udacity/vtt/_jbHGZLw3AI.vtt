The answer is, it print jello on one line, and then hello on the next line. On

00:00:06.685 --> 00:00:11.270
the second line, when we just print out greeting, we can see that it hasn't

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:17.000
changed from the original. We say that it didn't mutate. Instead of modifying

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.920
the original string, the replace method returns a new one. This would be like

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.260
if you had a mean cat and you told your cat to be nicer. And instead of

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.230
becoming nicer, it just gave you a new, nicer cat. That's why we call replace

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.470
an accessor method, not a mutator.
