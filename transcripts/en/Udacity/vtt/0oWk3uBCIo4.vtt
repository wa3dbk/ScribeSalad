00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.950
When using maps in your application
the map fragment provides a view

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.480
over the map, based on the
specifications defined on your camera.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.410
If you don't define a camera you just
get a view of the entire world over

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.560
latitude zero and longitude zero.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.020
Understanding the camera is
the key to understanding your app.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.770
The camera is controlled using
a class called CameraPosition.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.440
The properties that define
your camera are the targets.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.650
And this is the latitude and longitude
that you want to point the camera at.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.740
This lat long will define
the center of your map.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.920
And how much of the map you
see is determined by the zoom.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.140
This is a value from zero, the furthest
out effectively showing the whole world,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.280
down to 21,
which is really close to street level.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.860
You can get in even closer
by using Street View,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.130
and you'll see that in a later lesson.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.800
Bearing is a property, and

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.380
this determines the direction
that the camera is facing.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.290
It's specified in degrees
clockwise from north.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.160
So if you want the camera to be facing
east, the bearing would be 90 degrees.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.210
If you wanted to face northwest,
the bearing would be 315 degrees.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.380
Tilt is how much
the camera is tilted by.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.210
By default,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.410
this is zero which means the camera is
facing directly down towards the ground.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.740
You can increase this with the upper
bound determined by how far zoomed

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.100
out you are.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.070
So, for example,
if you're zoomed out really far

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.690
the maximum tilt that you
could do is 30 degrees.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.410
As you get closer to the Earth,
the maximum tilt goes up.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.630
With a maximum of 67.5 degrees.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.560
You can just see tilt as how
the camera is tilted toward the ground,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.650
you're looking straight
down at the ground, or

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.890
you're tilted at the ground so
you can get a 3D isometric style view.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.680
Like you had with
the skyscrapers earlier on.
