00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
With an automatic test, and this is the main advantage,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you can always check whether the problem persists by running the automated test.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
An open automated test by definition reproduces the problem.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If the test fails, yes, you can start debugging right away.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And in the run you can query as much information as needed,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because you can always reproduce it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So, all four apply.
