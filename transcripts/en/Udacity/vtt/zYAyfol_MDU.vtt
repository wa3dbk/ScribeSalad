00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.029
We'll need to pass in some values in order to

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:03.830
meaningfully discuss this question.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.220
So, let's make some here.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.440
Furthermore, I'm going to make the variable names reflect the color of

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.830
the value that they store.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.590
At this point, now that we have some values, we can finally call the function,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.670
passing in a couple of the objects that we've made, so

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.070
we can see how they're treated.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.240
Input parameters to a function only have bindings when that

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.850
function is actually running.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.750
So only now that we have an example of invocation can we really

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.180
meaningfully evaluate what we expect parameter two to be bound to.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.280
So what do you expect to be logged in this example?
