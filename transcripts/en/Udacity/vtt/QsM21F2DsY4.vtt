00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.290
Welcome to the third course in CS

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.280
6250, where we will be discussing network operations

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.180
and management. This segment in the course has

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.775
three lessons. The first lesson is focused on

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:16.160
software-defined networking, and its role in making

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.390
network operations and management easier. The second module

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.600
covers traffic engineering, which is the process by

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.160
which network operators reconfigure the network to balance

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.010
traffic demands across the network. The third lesson covers

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.780
network security. We will start with a lesson on

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.550
Software Defined Networking. But before we jump into the

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.130
details, I'd like to motivate a little bit why.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.750
In particular I plan to tell you about the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.220
role of network operators in running the network. So

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.720
what is network management? Network management is the process

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.710
of configuring the network to achieve a variety of tasks.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.710
Network configuration achieves a variety of

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.840
tasks including balancing traffic load across the

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.220
network, achieving various security goals, and

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.260
satisfying business relationships that may exist between

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.427
the network that's being configured. And

00:01:05.427 --> 00:01:08.330
neighboring networks such as the network's upstream

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.480
Internet service provider. A key aspect

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.050
to network management is configuring the network.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.180
Unfortunately, if the network is not configured correctly, many

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.460
things can go wrong. Configuration mistakes can lead to problems,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.330
such as persistent oscillation, whereby, routers can't agree on a

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.120
route to a destination. Loops, where packets get stuck in between two or more

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.590
routers and never actually make it to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.670
the destination. Partitions, where by the network is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.540
split into two or more segments that are not connected,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.910
and black holes where packets reach a router that does

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.680
not know what to do with the packet and drops

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.380
it, as opposed to sending on to it's ultimate destination.
