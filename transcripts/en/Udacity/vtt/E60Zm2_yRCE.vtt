00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.730
Before we begin, we should take
a moment to discuss API usage limits.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.220
It is important to Google that
developers have access to

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.190
as much capacity as they
need to be successful.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.130
And so, usage of the Google Places API
for Android is free and unlimited for

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.180
all apps.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.640
However, to ensure fair use by all apps,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.900
there are tiered query
limits on some methods.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.080
The Places API enforces a default limit
of 1000 requests per 24 hour period.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.890
There's another checkpoint when your
average is 150,000 requests per day.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.980
If you exceed either of these
thresholds, your app may start to fail,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.430
as further API calls are denied.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.340
So to avoid this,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.800
we have a simple review process in
place to be granted a higher limit.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.070
Instructions on this review process can
be found in the documentation linked,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.250
in the instructor notes below.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.680
But because of these usage limits,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.530
in order to use the API,
you will need an Android API Key.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.640
If you fail to provide this, you may
notice that the Place Picker widget will

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.925
launch, and then immediately close.

00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:58.450
It's an interesting
error to try to debug.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.500
So to get properly configured, and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.670
create your API Key, you need to return
to the Google Developer console.
