00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.130
I haven't talked about how to convert from U,V values to texels, that's a

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.032
formula you can figure out. We have a texture of size 16 by 16 applied to a

00:00:08.032 --> 00:00:13.668
square, the U axis goes along the columns, the V axis goes up the rows. The

00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:18.684
lower left corner texel has a location of 00. The upper right is 15 15. With

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:24.047
the X axis coordinate listed first. The lower left corner of this 00 texel has

00:00:24.047 --> 00:00:31.815
UV coordinates of 0.0, 0.0. The upper right has 1.0, 1.0. So the question to

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:38.390
you is, what Texel is at location U,V equals to 0.72, 0.40. By the way, I want

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.050
integer answers, not floating point.
