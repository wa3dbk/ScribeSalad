00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.285
Well, if this is my image and these are the pixels on the boundary,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:07.845
I've assigned 1 thread per element or 1 thread per pixel.

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:11.688
A warp somewhere in the center of the image is not going to have any divergence.

00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:17.369
And similarly, a warp along the top or bottom rows is also not going to have any divergence

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.535
because in this case all of the threads responsible for the pixels along this row

00:00:22.535 --> 00:00:26.234
are going to call that special boundary handling code.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:33.246
So it's really only warps like these that are at the beginning or end of a row,

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:36.422
of an interior row, that have any divergence.

00:00:36.422 --> 00:00:39.549
In this case 1 thread will execute the boundary code.

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:42.057
That's the one responsible for the pixel in the boundary.

00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:45.754
The rest of the threads will execute the mainline code, the interior code.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:51.394
So in all these cases you have 2-way divergence, and that's the answer to our question.
