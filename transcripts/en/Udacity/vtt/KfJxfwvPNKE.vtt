00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.870
let's try another division problem. We are going to divide this rational

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.290
expression by this rational expression. Remember to change your division to

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.488
multiplication and then multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction. Then

00:00:12.488 --> 00:00:15.494
your problem turns into something that you've definitely seen before. You can

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:17.290
