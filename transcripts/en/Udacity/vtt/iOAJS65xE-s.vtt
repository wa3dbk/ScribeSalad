00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.827
Now that we've talked a bit about how our variables x and y are related in this

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:07.874
equation we've developed for the total weight of the suitcase depending on the

00:00:07.886 --> 00:00:11.701
number of glasses wiper sets that Grant puts in it, I think that the next step

00:00:11.713 --> 00:00:15.532
to further understand the relationship here, is to graph our equation. Now, I

00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:19.816
know that I've done some graphing for the class already on the tablet. But since

00:00:19.828 --> 00:00:24.122
I really want to encourage you to graph on physical, actual graph paper, I'm

00:00:24.134 --> 00:00:28.379
going to just show you a demo of how I do that. Justmake sure that you've got

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:32.772
the basics for setting up a graph and drawing a line totally down. So, I clearly

00:00:32.784 --> 00:00:37.115
has to switch pens since this one doesn't write on actual paper. Materials that

00:00:37.127 --> 00:00:41.498
are important for graphing include graphing paper, which is just paper with

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.753
lines on it, that create a grid. A ruler, like this lovely one right here. And a

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:49.858
pencil. I'm super picky about using pencils and not pens for graphing. I think

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.824
it's really important so that you can make sure that you can fix any mistakes

00:00:53.836 --> 00:00:57.610
that you've made by erasing. The xy table we created earlier is going to be

00:00:57.622 --> 00:01:01.285
really useful for helping us graph points. But before we can graph those points,

00:01:01.372 --> 00:01:04.735
we need to set up our coordinate plane. So, we need to draw a set of axes, we

00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:08.235
can plot these points on. So, start out by lining the ruler up with one of the

00:01:08.247 --> 00:01:11.835
vertical lines on the sheet of paper. Over to the left-hand side, since all of

00:01:11.847 --> 00:01:15.325
the values that we need to graph in this graph are both positive in x and y.

00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:19.206
Sometimes, this won't be the case and you'll need to think about where to put

00:01:19.218 --> 00:01:23.112
your axes, and how far to draw the x-axis in both directions and the y-axis in

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:27.101
both directions, so that you can fit all the important points on your graph. But

00:01:27.113 --> 00:01:31.165
for now, I have drawn a y-axis. And now, I line up the ruler horizontally, you

00:01:31.177 --> 00:01:35.711
can notice that it's positioned quite toward the bottom of the y-axis that I've

00:01:35.723 --> 00:01:39.848
drawn, since I don't really need any negative y values for this. And once I've

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.827
got the ruler situated properly, in relation to this horizontal line r ight

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:47.625
here, I can draw my x-axis. Wonderful, so now I have a y-axis and an x-axis.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.735
What's missing right now is some arrows. I know that the y-axis and the x-axis

00:01:51.747 --> 00:01:56.348
both extend infinitely in both directions, they both go from negative infinity

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.919
to positive infinity. I also like to label the origin with a 0, and I label each

00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:05.248
axis as well with a variable it corresponds to. Great, now I have some axis.

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.640
However, let's look at what numbers we actually need to plot. We need to plot

00:02:09.652 --> 00:02:13.953
from 0 to 50 in x and from 7 to 32 in y. We've got 0 laid out, that's great. But

00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:18.913
to go all the way to 50, I clearly can't have each one of these boxes stand for

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:23.758
1 on the x-axis or on the y-axis either. So, we need to make a scale. Since I

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.672
have quite a few boxes here, and I'm only graphing 6 points, I need to make

00:02:28.684 --> 00:02:33.946
every grid length on the x-axis stand for 5. And just for simplicity, I'll label

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:38.177
every two grids with a 10. So, 10, 20, and so on, and so forth. I can do the

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.981
same thing or a similar thing for the y-axis. Here, I only need to go up to 32

00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:46.071
though, so I can probably space my numbers out a little bit more. I've labeled

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:50.099
my y-axis that every 2 grid links stands for 5. And, of course, I've labeled it

00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:53.685
all the way up. Now, that we have our axes set up, we can actually start

00:02:53.697 --> 00:02:58.297
graphing points. This is sort of a tricky example to start with, so I'm sort of

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:02.377
glad that I picked it. Because you'll notice that since there are numbers that

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.564
end in 7 and in 2 on the y values, these aren't going to correspond exactly to

00:03:06.576 --> 00:03:10.612
grid lengths here. So, this is a great chance to see that sometimes when you're

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:14.521
graphing, you don't have points that end up exactly where lines on the grid

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:18.968
cross. You have to just be very careful and estimate as closely as you possibly

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.333
can. To remind us of the coordinate or ordered pair notation that we'll often

00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:27.662
see when we're moving to graphs, I've written all the data in the table here in

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:31.894
point notation. Okay, let's actually graph. First point, 0 7, so we start at 0

00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:36.043
on the x-axis and move up 7 in y. The point halfway between 5 and 10 is 7 and a

00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:40.301
half, so we're going to be right below that. And I'll put a point right there.

00:03:40.401 --> 00:03:44.694
We have 10,12 so we go to 10 on the x, and 12, which will be just below this

00:03:44.706 --> 00:03:48.647
line right here, which is 12 and a half. And we continue just like this. Hm,

00:03:48.747 --> 00:03:53.091
something looks kind of funny to me. Let's check with a ruler to see if all of

00:03:53.103 --> 00:03:57.995
these points lie on a single straight line. Clearly, this one doesn't, so I must

00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:01.169
have done something wrong. It's really, really easy when you're graphing. Two,

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:05.786
when you move over on the x-axis and then up to your y-coordinate, accidentally

00:04:05.798 --> 00:04:09.617
switch your hand position horizontally, and add to a graph in their own point.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:13.440
This is why we just need to check our work very carefully. Okay. So, that was

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:17.184
the point 40 27,. So, I'll just graph that one again. 40, very carefully

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:21.238
following this line up to the 27 mark, that looks better than the other point.

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:25.226
So, you can see I must have just shifted my hand to right when I was graphing.

00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:29.496
Okay. Now, that I have all my points, let's make a line through them. Rulers are

00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:33.739
really helpful but you also have to make sure that you're using them as best you

00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:37.655
can. I like to put the point of my pencil on a point and then line the ruler up

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:41.527
with the pencil tip, just make sure that the ruler's actually going to be in

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.231
line with the points. I can do the same thing with the last point I'm going to

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:49.352
graph. And now, I actually connect the points. Get a beautiful line. Wonderful.

00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:53.847
Now, since conceivably, Grant could pack more than 50 pairs of glasses wipers in

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:57.632
his suitcase, I'm going to draw and arrow on the end of the line right here.

00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:00.943
This indicates that the graph could continue increasing in the x-direction and,

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:05.656
in this case, the y-direction as well, past this last point that we graphed. I'm

00:05:05.668 --> 00:05:09.017
not going to put one over on this end though because for the purposes of the

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:12.580
dealer we're dealing with, we're not going to have negative x values. Grant

00:05:12.592 --> 00:05:16.213
can't pack a negative number of glasses wipers in his bag. This would be very

00:05:16.225 --> 00:05:19.980
different though, if we were graphing other kind s of equations that don't

00:05:19.992 --> 00:05:23.831
necessarily correspond to things that can't have negative quantities. So, with

00:05:23.843 --> 00:05:27.620
most graphs, you'll see an arrow on the other end of the line as well. We'll see

00:05:27.632 --> 00:05:28.727
that in later examples.
