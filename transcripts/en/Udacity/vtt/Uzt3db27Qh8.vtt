00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.270
Along with all the other changes
that you've been making in the app,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.230
now that you know who the owner is,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.270
you can start implementing some
rudimentary premissioning.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.820
For example,
there are some things in the app

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.200
that only the owner of
a list should be able to do.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.640
I'll start with two pretty simple ones.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.575
Only the owner of a list should
be able to edit the list name,

00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:20.652
and only the owner of a list should
be able to remove that list.

00:00:20.652 --> 00:00:23.396
Now if the person looking at that
list isn't the owner of the list,

00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:26.480
they shouldn't even have the option
to be able to do these things.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.410
You know who's logged in,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.290
and you should be able to grab
list data for the database.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.330
So, could you write the code that will
only show these options if the user is

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.460
the owner of the list?

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.780
I'll send over the full spec now.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.280
Take a look.
