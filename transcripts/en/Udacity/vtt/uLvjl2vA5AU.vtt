00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.740
Okay so let's look at the first one. Well I

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.760
don't think that the fact of keeping developers busy is really

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.020
one of the highlights or the main benefits of iterative

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.310
approaches. Developers are really busy without any need for additional help.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.950
So I will just not mark this one. The second

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.280
one conversely is definitely one of the advantages of iterative approaches.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.710
So the fact that iterative approaches give the developers a early

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.890
feedback, is a great advantage which has in turn additional advantages.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.340
For example, it increases the project tempo, so it gives the developers

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.350
not busy but more focused. It's easier to be focused when you

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.790
have a short term deadline, or a short term goal

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.670
rather than a release that is planned in six months or even

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.420
later. Another advantage of this early feedback is the fact that developers

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.390
are rewarded for their efforts so, there is sort of an immediate

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.360
rewards because you can see the results of your effort instead of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.310
having to wait a long time to see such results. And last,

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.126
but not least the fact of getting early feedback also minimizes

00:00:55.126 --> 00:00:58.570
the risks of developing the wrong system. So why is that?

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.820
Well because getting early feedback will also allow us to find

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.140
out whether we're going in the wrong direction early in the development process

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.460
rather than at the end. And therefore, will minimize this risk.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760
Going back to the previous question, yeah, I don't think that, you

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.960
know, doing the same thing over and over is a great

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.170
advantage. And in fact, iterative approaches do not do the same thing

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.940
over and over. So they keep iterating, but they keep

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.930
augmenting the amount of functionality in the system. They don't

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.960
just repeat the same thing. As for improving planning, actually

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.980
improving planning is not really a strength of these approaches,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.880
because sometimes the number of iterations is hard to predict,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.050
so it's hard to do a natural planning when you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.440
are using an iterative approach. So finally, are iterative approaches

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.700
good for accomodating evolving requirements?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.630
Most definitely. First, iterative approaches, and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.590
in particular, the one that we're discussing consider requirements

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.900
incrementally, so they can better incorporate your requirements. So if

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.030
there are new requirements, it's easier to accommodate them using

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.210
an iterative approach. Second, these approaches realize a few requirements

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.740
at a time. Something from the most risky ones, as

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.600
we said. So any problem with those risky requirements will

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.220
be discovered early, and suitable course corrections could be taken.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.850
So in case you still have doubts about iterative approaches,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.460
it might be worth it to go back to

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.390
mini course number one, lesson number two to discuss the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.620
life cycle models. Because we talk about iterative approaches

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.770
and their advantages and their characteristics there in some detail.
