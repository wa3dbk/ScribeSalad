00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.944
We now have some sense of how we can make lighting calculations, not take an

00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:07.622
incredible amount of time. In this lesson, we're going to take an extremely high

00:00:07.622 --> 00:00:11.484
level view of how objects get rendered by a graphics accelerator. This graphics

00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:16.074
hardware is usually called the GPU, for graphics processing unit. A GPU uses a

00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:20.274
rendering process called rasterization or scan conversion, which is optimized to

00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:25.450
use the simplifications I've outlined. Let's look at one rendering pipeline from

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.614
end to end. The idea of a pipeline is to treat each object separately. The first

00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:33.676
step is simply that the application sends objects to the GPU. What objects?

00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:37.926
Typically, 3D triangles. Each triangle is defined by the full locations of its

00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:42.491
three points. An application converts a cube into just a few triangles. A sphere

00:00:42.491 --> 00:00:46.477
gets turned into a bunch of triangles. So, in the first step, the application

00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:50.159
decides what triangles to send down the pipeline. In the second stage of the

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.393
pipeline, these triangles are modified by the camera's view of the world along

00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:57.169
with whatever modelling transform is applied. A modelling transform is a way to

00:00:57.169 --> 00:01:01.430
modify the location, orientation and even the size of a part. For example, if

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.390
you were rendering a bouncing ball, the ball's modeling transform each frame,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.216
would move the ball to a different location along it's path. The effect of the

00:01:09.216 --> 00:01:12.966
camera view is clear enough. After the object is moved to it's location for the

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:17.196
frame, is it still in view of the camera? That is, is the object inside the view

00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:21.570
frustum. If not, then we're done with this object, since it won't affect any

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.936
pixels on the screen. In this case, we say the object is fully clipped. So here,

00:01:25.936 --> 00:01:30.794
this cube is fully clipped since its outside of the view frustum. The camera and

00:01:30.794 --> 00:01:34.410
modelling transforms compute the location of each triangle on the screen. If the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.130
triangle is partially or fully inside the frustum, the three points of the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.004
triangle on the screen are then used in a process called rasterization. If a

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:45.774
triangle is slightly off the screen, it gets clipped and it's turned into more

00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:50.142
triangles. This process identifies all the pixels whose centers are inside the

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:54.451
triangle. In other words, it fills in the triangle. So, rasterization here has

00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:59.000
found that this triangle covers the pixel centers, in these various places.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.193
These locations are then used to show the image of the triangle on the screen.
