00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.250
Here is a problem that may look slightly more complicated than what we've done

00:00:04.262 --> 00:00:08.515
before. But you know everything you need to know to solve it. And I'm even going

00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:12.555
to give you the first step that I'd like you to do. I want us to start out by

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:16.835
dividing each side by 3. If you do this first step, then what do you end up with

00:00:16.847 --> 00:00:18.485
on either side of the equation?
