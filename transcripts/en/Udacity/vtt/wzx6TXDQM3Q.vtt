Let me do this here, there's two of age 19, 3 times the age 22, two aged 23, 24 and 25

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and now we can call this at exactly 11.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is where you'll find the lower quartile, the median and the upper quartile.

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's 20, 22 and 23.
