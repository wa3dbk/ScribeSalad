00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.340
Here's another bit about color.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.860
Contrary to popular belief, the rainbow effect is not an optimal color scale for

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.029
human visual perception.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.360
This visualization displays the endothelial sheer stress, or

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.620
simply the pressure on different parts of artery walls.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.250
Areas of low pressure, as shown in blue are troublesome and

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.340
can lead to heart attacks.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.530
Michelle Borkin, a researcher at Harvard School of Engineering and

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.900
Applied Science, conducted a study to determine whether visualizations like this

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.560
rainbow model, could be improved to increase the accuracy and

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.510
speed of the diagnosis of heart disease.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.110
In her study, she tested whether two-dimensional models were better than

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.160
the three-dimensional models.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.410
So here's the three-dimensional model, and here's the two-dimensional model.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.190
But you might notice that she also tested something else.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.720
She tested whether the standard rainbow colors,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.750
which are found among many default settings in visualization software

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.730
outperformed the type of color palette shown here.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.650
So, what type of color palette is shown here?

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.280
Type in your answer here.
