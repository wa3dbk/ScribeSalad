00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.810
So the question is what is the largest sized

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.360
index where we can do a lookup in about

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.150
one second? So if you look at the executions

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.620
we have, we've seen the time it takes with

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.080
an index with 10,000 is .0009 seconds. The time with

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.870
an index of 100,000 is .0085 seconds. And

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.210
your goal is to predict what the largest index

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.100
that can support lookups that finish within about one

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.355
second is. And your choices are 200,000 keywords,

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:31.789
1,000,000 keywords, 10,000,000 keywords,

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.763
100,000,000 keywords, or 1,000,000,000 keywords.
