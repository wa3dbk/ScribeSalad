00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We have two dice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One has 6 sides and one has 8 sides.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We select which die to roll based on whether the flip of this coin is heads,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in which case was roll the 6-sided die,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
or tails, in which case we roll the 8-sided die.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What is the probability of rolling a 6?

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can assume that the coins and dice are fair.
