00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.961
The first thing we want to do is factor our numerator and denominator. To factor

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:09.300
the numerator, we find factors of negative 8 that sum to positive 2. And since

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.710
the coefficient in front of m squared is 1, we can use these two factors in our

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.146
binomials. For the denominator, we want to find factors of negative 12 that sum

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:22.879
to negative 1. These factors are negative 4 and positive 3. Now, we can't just

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:27.431
use these factors in our binomials since the m squared has a coefficient of 2.

00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:32.094
Instead, we'll need to use factoring by grouping. Using that method, we get a

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:36.308
denominator of 2 m plus 3 times m minus 2. Now that we have our factored form,

00:00:36.308 --> 00:00:40.853
we can cancel factors that appear in the numerator and denominator. Since they

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:45.004
equal 1. And this leaves us with our solution. We know we can't simplify the m's

00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:49.319
anymore since we have a sum and the numerator and the denominator. We don't have

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:51.057
anymore factors to cancel.
