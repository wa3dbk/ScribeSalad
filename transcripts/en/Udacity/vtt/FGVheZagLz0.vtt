00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.920
And now I want to look at a couple of examples of approaches taken to these kind

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.860
of applications. You can think of these a computing paradigms or, methods for

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.620
dealing with particular kinds of situations.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.900
In particular they both relate to services. One of them is web services and

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.420
the other is service oriented architecture.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.250
For the purposes here we can say that a service is a self contained, self

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.700
defined unit of computation that's meaningful to the user. We'll go into that

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.010
a little bit more when we look as these two particular, types of implications.
