00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.269
Here are the problems you did in the last couple of quizzes. Did you notice a

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:08.563
pattern at all while you were doing them? If I have a general statement, x to

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:12.820
the a all to the b power, how could I express this with a single exponent? In

00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:17.151
other words, what happens if I want to get rid of the parentheses around the x

00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:17.871
to the a here?
