00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.715
In the Forecast Fragment, we want to modify the

00:00:02.715 --> 00:00:05.070
FetchWeatherTask, so that we can pass in the

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.730
postal code parameter when we execute that task.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.370
You can click on this class, to jump

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.780
to where it's defined or you can use this shortcut. And here you see that we

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.640
modified the generic input type, to be a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.080
string so that the doInBackground method receives string params.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.783
Now, we only passed in one string param,

00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:30.923
94043. So when you see down here later, we

00:00:30.923 --> 00:00:33.816
can read out the zeroth position in the params

00:00:33.816 --> 00:00:37.520
array, to get that postal code. Notice that we're

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.590
using the UI builder here, and we're appending query

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.830
parameters, one by one. We define constants for these

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.100
query params, as seen here. And for the values,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.300
we also define them up here. You can imagine

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.590
that in the future these might be configured outside

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.580
of this class, but for now we're just going

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.820
to define them here. To verify that this URI

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.010
was defined properly, we add a verbose log command

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.629
to print out the built URI. Let's verify that

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.460
the log we added actually shows up. In overflow

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.350
menu we tap Refresh. Then we see the log

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.300
tag FetchWeatherTask with our UI printed out. It says

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.610
94043, jSON format metric units, seven days. So this looks correct.
