00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.969
The other extreme, of course, is to use a direct

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.010
trie where instead of 1 bit per look up we might

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.760
have 1 memory access responsible for looking up a much

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.420
larger number of bits. So, for example, we might have a

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.900
2 level trie. Where the first memory access is dictated

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.540
by the first 24 bits of the address, and the second

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.580
memory access is dictated by last 8 bits of the address.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.360
Now here, we can look up an entry in the forwarding

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.900
table with just two memory accesses, the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.020
problem is that this structure results In a

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.130
very inefficient use of memory, unlike the single

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.780
bit trie. To see why suppose that we

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.580
want to represent a /16 prefix. Well unfortunately we have no way of encoding a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.720
lookup that's just 16 bits. We have to

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.150
rather encode 2 to the 8th identical entries,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.470
corresponding to the 2 to the 8th/24 prefixes that are

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.840
contained in that /16, so this is extremely inefficient use of memory.
