00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.450
We've learned how to use build types
to customize Gradle's behavior.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.360
So now let's look at how build variants
allow you to control the behavior of

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.910
your app itself.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.120
And depending on which
app we're building,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.100
the Android Gradle plugin creates
a whole slew of source sets.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.885
And depending on which variant you're
building, it will merge the sources and

00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:18.475
resources from those source
sets into the final APK.

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:20.845
At the most broad level,

00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:24.315
there's the main source set
which is located in source main.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:27.155
This is where we've been
putting all of our code so far.

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:30.120
Additionally, there's a source set for
each product flavor.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.280
Assuming our example from before,
let's say we have a free and

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.890
a paid product flavor.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.910
There's also a source set for each build
type, in this case debug and release.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.740
Finally there's also a source for
each final variant.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.700
So that's source free debug, free
release, paid debug, and paid release.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.910
If we have sources and resources
that we need in a paid flavor but

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.930
not in the free flavor,
we can put them in source paid.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.770
Similarly, if there are resources
we need for debug build but not for

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.290
the release build,
we can put them in source debug.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.010
Finally, if we have resources
that are needed only for

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.420
the paid debug variant, then we can
put them in the source paid debug.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.340
When we build a particular variant,
Gradle will take care of all

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.810
the emerging sources and
resources we need for that variant.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.580
It will also take care of a variety of
resources that are defined in more than

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.230
one configuration.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.860
The rule is that the more
specific configurations

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.700
override the less
specific configurations.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.030
Java's source files
cannot be overwritten, so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.320
you need to be careful that you don't
try to define the same class definition,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.510
and it ends up in multiple variants.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.720
Gradle can do a bit better for
resource files like strings.xml, or

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.540
even Android Manifests.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.390
For resources of that type,
the files will be merged, and

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.890
the entries will be overridden by ID.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.520
To determine what sources and resources
are included when we build a particular

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.790
variant, we can draw a diagram
that looks like this.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.530
We start in the middle.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.350
If we want to build the paid debug
variant, Gradle will include everything

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.220
in main, then merge everything in paid,
overriding any conflicts.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.490
Next Gradle will merge in everything
from debug overriding again.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.210
Then, finally,
Gradle will merge in the resources and

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.508
source that are in paid debug.
