00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.580
So we have seen that hard drives do

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.030
not really benefit from Moore's Law. They don't get

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.210
much faster and also, although their capacity is

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.938
improving, their speed is very, very, very slow. So

00:00:11.938 --> 00:00:15.335
one question would be RAMs, especially DRAM, are

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:20.040
benefiting from Moore's Law in terms of capacity. So

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.480
their capacity is growing about as fast as

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.520
the capacity of hard drives, but they're way faster

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.320
than hard drives. Hard drive access times

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.351
are about, let's say, ten milliseconds, whereas RAM

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:35.500
access times are well under a microsecond.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.570
So we're talking about at least three orders

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.450
of magnitude speed difference. So the reason

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.370
we normally do not use memory for storage

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.030
is that the hard drives are about

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.920
100 times cheaper per gigabyte. However, DRAM has

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.922
many times better latency than hard drives. So people came up with this

00:00:56.922 --> 00:01:03.126
idea of solid-state disk, SSD, which really is not a disk at all. It is just

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:07.636
solid-state, meaning electronic storage, but because it's

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:10.506
intended as disk replacement they call it

00:01:10.506 --> 00:01:16.086
disk. One approach to build a solid-state disk would be to use DRAM and our

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:21.078
controller that will refresh it and then have a battery so that we can keep the

00:01:21.078 --> 00:01:24.570
DRAM content refreshed and not lose it. This

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.975
is very fast. It's actually very reliable, more reliable

00:01:28.975 --> 00:01:31.600
than the hard drives, but it is extremely

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.636
expensive. And it is not good for archiving

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:38.248
data because eventually the battery will run out,

00:01:38.248 --> 00:01:41.356
and then we lose our content, whereas a hard

00:01:41.356 --> 00:01:46.780
drive can be stored for a really long time. Today there is another option, which

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.800
is flash memory. So flash is fabricated in

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.360
similar technology to the one that is used

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.553
for making DRAMs and processors. And it uses

00:01:56.553 --> 00:02:00.239
transistors to store data so it benefits from

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:04.230
Moore's law. It consumes very little power because

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.480
unlike a disk that spins all the time

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.405
even when you're not using it, flash, while

00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:13.210
it's idle, consumes very, very little power. And

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.310
also it doesn't need to move any heads

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.750
or anything. It's still very fast, way faster

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.870
than disks, although it is slower than DRAM,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.990
and it has smaller capacity than disks because

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.030
for flash we are still expressing their sizes

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.780
in gigabytes, whereas disks easily go into the terabytes.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.760
And one good thing about flash, as compared to the DRAM and battery, is that

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.480
flash keeps the data alive without power. So you can store something in a flash,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.355
forget about it for several years, and you will probably still be able to read

00:02:47.355 --> 00:02:50.205
it, whereas here, your battery will almost

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:52.880
certainly be dry after a couple of years.
