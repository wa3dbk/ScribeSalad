00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.469
If you'd play your application to App Spot, you

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.930
can explore the entities in the data store using the

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.860
Admin Console. Let's take a quick demo of how

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.110
to get there. So to get to the Admin Console,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.290
you go to console.developers.google.com. And it will list your

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.160
projects. This is one project here, and then you click

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.480
on that. You click on the project that you want

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.630
to investigate. And it will take you to the dashboard

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.580
for your project. So you see there's a, an App Engine

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.930
section that let's you get to various. Things about App Engine,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.200
I think you already looked at that. So if you click

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.720
down here, you see the cloud data store option. And this will

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.150
take you to the dashboard for your data store. Dashboard shows

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.650
you various kinds of information about your project. You can get

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.400
statistics of all your entities, you get breakdown by property type.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.040
You can get the total size of the entities that are stored

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.120
in the data store. See this here, the indexes?

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.390
You'll be learning about indexes really soon. So, go

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.610
ahead, you can go ahead and explore the, the

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.349
dashboard, see what kind of information is in there. What

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.490
I really want to talk about is the query.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.790
So, if you click query, it takes you to

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.300
the page where you can find out information about

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.970
the entities that have been saved. This kind of menu,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.430
just like in the local host. Admin Console lists

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.520
the kinds of entities that are stored. Right now

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.670
I only have profile, and these other two things

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.670
are internal to App Engine. I'm looking at the entities

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.360
of kind profile, I've only got one, that's the

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.420
profile that I just created. You can see the display

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.690
name, the main email, the tee shirt size. Can

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.020
drill down into it if you want. You can even

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.650
change the values here. Obviously you'd really only

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.390
want to do that during development. This is

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.640
where you would come to check your entities. And it can be a really useful tool.
