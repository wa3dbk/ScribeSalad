00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
Why you're doing all this is to define the minimum viable product,

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.840
or sometimes called the MVP for short.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.280
The MVP basically is what product or service you're building in your first instance

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.410
that's delivered to customers.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.740
And the MVP is not an alpha or beta. This is a big idea.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.460
In the old days, the product development process would go from seed funding

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.690
to concept to a market requirements document to an engineering requirements document

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.340
and blow out into an entire waterfall development process.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.060
And part of those steps were alpha test, beta test, and first customer ship,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.450
and you'd be shipping and telling customers, "Here's a buggy, unfinished product."

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.590
"Why don't you test it for me?"

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.490
And then you'd always argue with sales about whether you should charge for it or not.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.100
But the MVP is actually quite different.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.800
The MVP says, "No, no, no. We're not spec'ing a version 1.0 product

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.650
"that has a spec 18 pages long."

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.330
"We're actually doing the work outside the building first

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.230
"and trying to understand what's the minimum version of a version 1.0--

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.790
"not what engineering or the founders thought

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.100
"but what is it customers are going to tell us they'll pay for or use now?"

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.660
And while it might be, quote, a beta product,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.670
we never use that word.

00:01:20.670 --> 99:59:59.000
We actually tell customers it's a minimum viable product.
