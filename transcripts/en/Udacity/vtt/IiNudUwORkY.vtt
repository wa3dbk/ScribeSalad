00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this summing numbers problem, we're given a string

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
such as the one I have here, "hello 2 all of you 44."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And we output the sum of all the integer numbers in the string.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So here we have 2 and 44,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and we're going to return the number 2 + 44,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and with some advanced math, is 46.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
How are we going to solve this?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well, one way, using only the totals you had in CS101,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
might be to iterate through the string character by character,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
checking if the current character is a number

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and then continue concatenating that string of numbers

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
until we don't reach a number, so we'd have 2, and then we'd hit a space,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and then we add 2 to our total running sum.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That isn't a very elegant way to do that.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We'd rather use regular expressions to help us out,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
so to get us there, let's think of a regular expression

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that matches the numbers that we are looking for.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Well, numbers range 0-9,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and we want 1 or more of them, and that's it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We're going to use our friend re.findall with this regular expression

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in the input string, and for everything that's matched,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
we add it to our running sum.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Let's write a bit of code to do just that.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I remember to import the re library, and I've defined

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
my procedure sumnums that takes in 1 parameter that is the sentence.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I've now written the regular expression that we came up with previously,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and I initialize my sum to 0.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And now I'm going to run find all with this regular expression

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
on the input sentence, and it's going to return a list of all the occurrences

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
of that regular expression, in this case, a list of all the numbers.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So found is going to equal one at a time

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
all the numbers found in our input sentence,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and remember from the hint given in the problem,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
the int procedure will turn a string

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
into an integer if it so applies,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and so we're going to update our sum with the integers that we find in the string,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and once we're done, we're going to return the sum.
