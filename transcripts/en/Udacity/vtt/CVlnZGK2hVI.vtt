00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.719
So watch the sagas array as we run this line of code.

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.430
At this point, a new function has been added to the sagas array.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.370
And even though that function is being referenced by a variable in

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.520
the global scope, the function itself has the blue type of scope access because

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.160
it's fundamentally a blue function that originated inside that red function.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.030
So we've reached the big question.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.160
What do you think is going to happen when we try to run one of

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.770
these blue saga functions that was created inside the red context but

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.020
is now being accessed from the green context?

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.930
Remember the red context that it was created in

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.490
has already completed and returned.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.200
So any variables that are referenced by this blue

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.210
function from the red context seem perhaps like they should be unavailable.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.760
So, when we invoke this saga sub zero function,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.600
a blue box should appear somewhere in our diagram.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.750
Based on your understanding of how these contexts work,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.540
where would you expect that blue box to appear?
