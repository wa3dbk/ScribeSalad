00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.873
So how do we do this? Well, we find the smallest element,

00:00:02.873 --> 00:00:06.507
and we know that it must move to the smallest output location.

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:11.529
So, in that case, that's going to be a zero here. This is the smallest element out of all of these.

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:16.187
It's going to be scattered to output location zero. The next smallest element is here,

00:00:16.187 --> 00:00:23.106
and then here, and then here, and then here, here, here, and here.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:29.063
So the key here is, how do we get these numbers? That's the important part of the merge algorithm here.

00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:33.500
So we're going to put ourselves in the mental position of one of these elements in the first list.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.074
So we're going to pick this particular element right here,

00:00:36.074 --> 00:00:41.077
and we're going to say, "Hey, what position am I in my own list?

00:00:41.077 --> 00:00:46.482
Well, I'm a position 2 because there are 2 elements in front of me in my list."

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:51.024
So, he would be at position zero, he would be at position 1, and I'm at position 2.

00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:56.926
Now here's the cool part. This guy has to ask, "Where would I be in the other list?"

00:00:56.926 --> 00:01:01.663
Well, if I look at this list I would need to be right here.

00:01:01.663 --> 00:01:08.366
So if I was in that list I would also be at position number 2 because there would be 2 elements in front of me.

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:13.750
This guy would be at position 0, this guy would be at position 1, and I would be at position 2,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.652
so in the overall list I know I'm behind 2 elements here,

00:01:17.652 --> 00:01:22.285
and I know I'm behind 2 elements here, so I can add those things together

00:01:22.285 --> 00:01:27.724
and discover that in the final sorted list I would be at position number 4,

00:01:27.724 --> 00:01:34.130
and that is the scatter address that I need to put him in the right position in the output list.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.441
So how do we know our position in our own list? Well, that's very simple.

00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:41.571
We've launched these threads as a contiguous block with 1 element per thread.

00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:45.949
So I'm going to be exactly at my thread ID. He's thread ID 0,

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:51.814
he's thread ID 1, and he's thread ID 2. So how do we know our position in the other list?

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:53.947
That's a little bit more complex.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:58.053
What we need to do to make this work is to do a binary search in the other list.

00:01:58.053 --> 00:02:04.797
So, this element will look in the other list, move down as a binary search until it finds out where it's going

00:02:04.813 --> 00:02:09.833
to belong in the other list. Every thread does an independent binary search in

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:14.357
parallel in the other list. So for a sorted list of length n,

00:02:14.357 --> 00:02:19.373
that will take log n steps per element, and all of those elements will do the search in parallel,

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:22.810
and that's a very fast operation if we're doing it out of shared memory.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.979
Now, for sorting more elements that can fit in shared memory,

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.884
then what we generally do is read in only a chunk of each sorted list,

00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:33.487
compute the first part of the output, write it back into main memory,

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:36.357
refill the input arrays with more elements, and repeat until done.
