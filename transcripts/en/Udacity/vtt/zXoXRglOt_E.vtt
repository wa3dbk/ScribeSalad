00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.464
This can be written as log base 5 of 25 equals 2. Nice thinking if you found

00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:12.417
this. Remember that the base for this equation becomes the base of our

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:18.764
logarithm, and that the logarithm of any number Is an exponent. This means log

00:00:18.764 --> 00:00:25.380
base five of 25 must equal 2. We're asking ourselves, what do we raise five to

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.290
in order to get 25? That power is 2.
