00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.080
Looking at this term, the constant factors
are 5, 7, and 2. So, we can write

00:00:06.092 --> 00:00:12.196
those in the first three slots right here.
Because of the commutativity of

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:17.661
multiplication it doesn't matter what
order we write the 5, 7, and 2

00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:21.610
in. Instead, I could have written 2,
7, 5 or 2, 5, 7 or 7,

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:27.908
5, 2, or any order of these three
numbers in these first three slots. For

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.527
simplicity sake, I'm just going to leave
mine written this way, but you're answer

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.842
is right as long as these three constant
factors are in these first three slots.

00:00:39.052 --> 00:00:44.110
Now, what's left over to deal with are the
variable factors. So for those, we have x,

00:00:44.217 --> 00:00:49.715
y and z. Here, it's important to remember,
the invisible multiplication signs between

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:54.635
these constant factors in the adjacent
variables. Remembering that those are

00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:59.585
there is what's going to allow us to pull
out the variables and move them around.

00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:05.045
So, I'm just going to keep x, y, and z in
the order they're written in and fill them

00:01:05.057 --> 00:01:10.366
into the slots right here. Now, just like
with the constant factors, we could write

00:01:10.378 --> 00:01:15.666
these variables in any order that we want
to. We could write z,y,x, z,x,y, x,y,z,

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:22.031
actually, that's what we have, [LAUGH]
y,x,z, . Any order these three variables

00:01:22.043 --> 00:01:26.693
go in is correct as long as they are in
these last three slots.
