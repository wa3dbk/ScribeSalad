00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's take a look at my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.450
So the first thing I do is assert that the length of the graph is equal to the length of the cover

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.720
since we need the same number of nodes and vertices in both the cover and the graph.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.390
We set n equal to length of the graph then.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.910
So we go through every element in the adjacency matrix one by one

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.020
and if the element is at 1, that is there's an edge between those two vertices,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.360
and either the first vertex which I think is not equal to 1, that is it is not part of the vertex cover

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.990
or the second vertex it isn't, then we return false.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.410
And we check every single one of those and if we fall through all of those, then we go ahead

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.270
and return true and then it is a valid vertex cover.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.080
Now for the naive vertex cover algorithm, what we do is first

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.270
for every assignment and a product of 0's or 1's

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.780
that is of length n, that's what this product statement does.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.600
And if the validity check is true for that assignment and that input graph,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.870
then we set the size to be the sum of the number of 1's in the assignments.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.000
So we add up all the elements in that list, all the 0's and 1's.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.290
Now if the minimum vertex cover is greater than the size, then we set that to be the size.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.270
We update it, otherwise, we leave it alone.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.070
Once we've look through every possible assignment

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.740
and remember there are a lot of possible assignments,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.880
then we return the minimum vertex cover.
