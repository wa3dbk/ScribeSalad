00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.051
So there are two main pathways that are activated during stress response, that

00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:09.648
start in the hypothalamus. First is the adrenal medullary system. Now think

00:00:09.648 --> 00:00:13.459
back to lesson 1, when I saw the snake. When I initially saw the snake, the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.880
stress was encountered. In my hypothalamus, sends information, to the brain

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.742
stem, to activate the sympathetic nervous system. From an evolutionary

00:00:22.742 --> 00:00:26.341
perspective, our ability to engage the activation of our fight or flight

00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:31.730
response, has important benefits. When we encounter an emergency, or a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.817
dangerous situation, this causes the release of catecholamines and the

00:00:35.817 --> 00:00:42.150
activation of our fight or flight response, allow us to behave appropriately.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.544
Meaning, we can either run away or we can stay and fight. So here are the

00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:50.450
catecholamines were released and I obviously opted to flee, rather than to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.050
stand and fight. However, long term activation of your sympathetic nervous

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.372
system. Can have some serious negative effects. This constant increase in heart

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:03.564
rate, can cause damage, but we're going to talk more about the negative

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:06.829
consequences of chronic stress shortly.
