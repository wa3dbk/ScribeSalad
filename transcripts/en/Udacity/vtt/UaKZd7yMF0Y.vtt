00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.365
Okay.

00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:04.207
We're going to cover one last thing with exponents, and it has to do with

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:08.572
squares. In particular, I mean squaring numbers, like 4 squared and 5 squared.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.779
Specifically, I want to know if 4 squared plus 5 squared is the same thing as

00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:16.925
the quantity of 4 plus 5 squared. I'm going to draw some squares to help us out.

00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:21.107
This square's going to have sides of 4, and this square's going to have sides of

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.564
5. This square is going to have sides of 4 plus 5, or 9. But I'm going to split

00:00:25.576 --> 00:00:29.865
it up so that way I can see the side with 4 and then 5. It will look like this.

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:33.579
This side is going to be 4 and this side is going to be 5. I've kind of

00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:37.933
exaggerated it, but it's okay. This side is also going to be 4 and this side is

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:38.520
going to be 5.
