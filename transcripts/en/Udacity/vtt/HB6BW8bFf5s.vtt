00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.500
We can remove a 4 from the first 3 terms of out numerator, leaving us with 4

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.124
times x squared plus 4x plus 4. We can also remove a 4 as a greatest common

00:00:10.124 --> 00:00:14.010
factor from 4x and 8. This leaves us with 4 times x plus 2 in our denominator.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.707
We have a quadratic trinomial here and not only that it's a perfect square

00:00:18.707 --> 00:00:23.212
trinomial, so we can factor that as x plus 2 times x plus 2. Finally, we cancel

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:27.570
the factors in the numerator and the denominator. So x plus two divided by x

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.772
plus two equals one, and four divided by four equals one. Remember, we're only

00:00:31.772 --> 00:00:35.930
simplifying factors, or things that are being multiplied in our numerator and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.832
our denominator. This leaves us with x plus two divided by one, or just x plus

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:45.450
two. Notice that not every rational expression simplifies to another fraction.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.883
Sometimes we'll just get another polynomial.
