00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.270
You actually did
an interesting experiment.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.910
Can you share something
about that with us?

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.890
&gt;&gt; Well, we called it the lessons
of the Kobayashi Maru

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.970
which is a Star Trek reference for
our audience.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.114
In the Star Trek episode, it was
an unwinnable exercise and young cadet,

00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:24.376
James T Kirk, was forced, or chose,
to cheat on an unwinnable scenario.

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:29.250
And he reprogrammed the computer, and
was able to succeed in that exercise.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.580
So, we want to put students
in a similar scenario,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.590
with the intent of deliberately forcing
them to take on adversary mindset.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.410
And mind you, the people that we
did this were government employees

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.120
that typically work nine to five.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.710
And they don't have this mindset.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.750
But they embraced it.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.570
What we asked them to
do was to take a test.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.390
We gave them very little notice, and
we told them the night before too, and

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.090
that they were expected
to cheat on the test.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.210
And if they were caught cheating,
then they failed.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.270
They weren't supposed to study.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.990
&gt;&gt; Okay, so cheating was allowed.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.140
&gt;&gt; Cheating was expected, and the test
itself was the first 100 digits of pi.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.740
So they had to recite
the first 100 digits of pi or

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.440
actually write them down.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.160
It actually worked out really well.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.930
I'll give you a couple of
examples of their creativity.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.820
One of them created business cards,
well actually had a stack, and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.790
came up the next day before the test and

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.540
was very proudly giving
us their business card.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.820
The rest of the stack, it turned out,
had the answer written on them.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.490
So this individual could have
walked around in front of us and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.220
given one to every single student,
and given them all the answer.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.120
He chose not to, but he could have
because he subverted our trust.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.020
Another example was someone who,
we allowed students to have soda

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.220
cans on their desk and
they printed out the answer.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.963
And put in on the side of the can and

00:01:52.963 --> 00:01:56.887
when we would walk around, they would
put their hand over the answers, and

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:59.459
then check the answers
when our back was turned.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.404
And my personal favorite was a student
who would take one of the books

00:02:04.404 --> 00:02:07.700
from the course,
scanned in the back cover,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.340
loaded it in Photoshop,
and ghosted in the answer.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.760
Printed it out, trimmed it down and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.070
used hairspray to tack it lightly
to the back cover of the book.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.580
It was indistinguishable unless
you closely looked at it.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.874
So they created a whole
entire false book cover.

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:26.950
But that's exactly what
we are looking for.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.470
We wanted people to
think like an adversary.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.030
It really comes down to trust.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.770
Where do you place trust?

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.130
Find those trust assumptions and
subvert.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.990
&gt;&gt; So in this case the proctor was
the security system in some sense.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.060
So you were proctoring all this time
when they were taking the test?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so during the test,
my colleague and I were proctoring it.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.110
And what was very funny, and granted,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.751
we weren't trying too hard
to catch them cheating.

00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:57.359
As we'd walk around the classroom,
in front of us, we'd see the students

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.235
staring up into the sky considering
the 73rd digit of pi, and

00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:03.376
behind us, we'd hear rustling.

00:03:03.376 --> 00:03:07.400
And then I'd slowly turn,
behind me were students

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.380
contemplating the 67th digit of pi,
the 82nd digit of pi.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.730
And then behind me I'd
start hearing rustling.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.410
But it was really a good deal of fun,
they embraced it I mean, I could go on.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.120
It was just,
the innovation was off the scale.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.610
But I felt it was a useful and
fun exercise.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.800
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.750
I think security we say is all about
our assumptions and guarantees.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.650
And assumptions have to be about
the nature of the threat you're going to

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.340
be dealing with.
