00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.530
So far we have talked about the very
basic process of case based reasoning

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.090
and we have portrayed as
if this process was linear.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.450
But of course the case based reasoning
process may not necessarily be linear.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.700
As an example, if the evaluation fails,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.230
then we might want to adapt that
particular case in a different way.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.690
As an example of the evaluation
of the candidate solution,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.790
that adaptation had produced fails.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.840
Then, instead of abandoning
that particular case,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.248
you might want to try to adapt it again.

00:00:33.248 --> 00:00:38.120
Alternatively, if we try to adapt
the same case several times, but

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.730
we just cannot adapt it,
we might want to abandon that case and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.710
try to find a different
case from the case memory.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.140
There is another possibility.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.430
Suppose that we retrieve
a case from memory.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.970
And we try to adapt it but

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.770
we are unable to adapt it to meet
the requirements of the new problem.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.190
In that case, you might want to abandon
the case and try to do a new one.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.300
There is yet another possibility.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.960
Let us suppose that we retrieve
a case from memory and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.940
it exactly matches the new problem.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.951
In that case, no adaptation needs to be
done and we can jump down to evaluation.

00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:08.706
In fact this is what happened when
we're discussing the KNN method.

00:01:08.706 --> 00:01:13.588
In this way we can see that there
are many ways in which this

00:01:13.588 --> 00:01:17.740
process need not necessarily be linear.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.590
&gt;&gt; So Ashok,
earlier you said that if the evaluation

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.750
shows that the new solution is good,
then we should store it.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.480
If the evaluation shows that
the new solution is not good,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.340
we should try adapting again or
we should try retrieving again.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.690
But what about evaluation showing
that new solution is not good?

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.220
Should we ever store those?

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.040
&gt;&gt; Indeed, sometimes studying
failed cases is also very useful.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.750
Failed cases can help
us anticipate problems.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.930
So imagine if you're
given a new problem, and

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.570
you retrieve from your
case memory a failed case.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.300
That failed case can be very useful
because it can help you anticipate

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.440
the kinds of problems that will
occur in solving the new problem.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.830
&gt;&gt; So that reminds me of another
example from our file input problem.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.920
One thing I've encountered a lot when
I'm doing a file input is that if you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.260
read too far in the file,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.470
then the program will crash and
it'll give you an error.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.330
It will always give you the same error,
and it's a very common problem

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.230
because different languages do
file input slightly differently.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.190
So in my mind, I must have cases of
the different ways that it's failed

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.990
in the past, so I can anticipate those
and do it correctly in the future.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.200
&gt;&gt; Failures are great opportunities for
learning.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.490
When failures occur,
we can try to repair the failure

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.650
by going back from the evaluation
step to the adaptation step.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.680
Or we can try to recover
from the failure

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.150
by going from the evaluation step
all the way to the retrieval step.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.560
In addition, we can store these
failures in the case memory.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.190
When we store them in the case memory,
then these failures can help us

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.400
anticipate failures that might
occur with new problems.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.000
There's a flip side to this.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.810
Just like it is useful
to store failed cases,

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.180
it is not useful to store
every successful case.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.260
If we stored every successful case, then
very soon the case memory will become

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.000
very, very large, and the retrieval
step will become less efficient.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.970
This is sometimes called
the utility problem.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.550
We want to store only those successful
cases that in fact help us cover

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.540
a larger span of problems.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.300
This means that, even when a case
succeeds, we want to store it

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.380
only if there is something interesting
or noteworthy about that case.
