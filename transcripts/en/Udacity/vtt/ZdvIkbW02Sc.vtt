00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.518
This parabola has a vertex at 2, 1. Great work if you found this. We start by

00:00:07.518 --> 00:00:11.204
completing the square. We want to add a certain amount in order to make this a

00:00:11.204 --> 00:00:16.813
perfect square. We'll need to add four in order to do that. And since we add

00:00:16.813 --> 00:00:22.858
four here, let's also subtract four. This keeps our equation balanced. Remember

00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:28.229
that to complete the square here, we always add b over 2 squared. The b value

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:32.631
is negative 4, so b over 2 is negative 2, and that amount squared is positive

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:38.900
4. It's the amount we add in order to complete our square. Now we'll be ready

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.438
to write this expression as a perfect square. The positive 5 and negative 4

00:00:43.438 --> 00:00:48.993
will just stay on the end. Here's our perfect square. And here's our equation,

00:00:48.993 --> 00:00:52.760
simplified combining these two numbers. So the vertex is at positive 2 for the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.951
x coordinate, and positive 1 for the y coordinate. Our vertex is here, and we

00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:04.150
get it by setting this binomial equal to 0. And the k value, or the y

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.040
coordinate of the vertex is k. It's right here, positive 1. Now that we have

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.140
our vertex, we can actually plot two other points. The one right next to the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.200
vertex. Our a value is positive 1 so this means we move one unit left and right

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.315
at the vertex and then one unit up vertically. That will give us two additional

00:01:25.315 --> 00:01:29.262
points. And if we zoom in on our parabola, we can see this more clearly. We

00:01:29.262 --> 00:01:34.584
move left one and right one from the vertex. And then we move a units in the

00:01:34.584 --> 00:01:40.195
vertical direction, in this case one unit up. So left one and up one and right

00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:46.195
one and up one. This gives us our points at 1, 2 and 3, 2. Once we have these

00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:56.106
two points we can draw in the basic shape of our parabola. That's how we get

00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:56.920
this graph.
