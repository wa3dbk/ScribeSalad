00:00:00.147 --> 00:00:04.540
So here's some examples of models and
these are the same transformations that

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.182
we talked about earlier when we're
talking about doing mappings for

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:11.024
homographies and panoramas,
and things like that.

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:15.759
So we have very simply so we basically
go from the red to the, the green.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.412
So if we have a translation, right,
so this thing just move that way.

00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:23.204
And in translation,
how many unknowns are there?

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:23.945
&gt;&gt; Two.

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:24.700
&gt;&gt; Two, right.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.338
So since we get two equations for
each point,

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:30.541
we just need to track one point here,
one point there.

00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.790
If I know that between them, I know
how x changed, I know how y changed.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.891
Two equations, two unknowns.

00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:37.111
Great, everything is good.

00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:38.852
We have what's called a similarity.

00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:43.530
A transform similarity is where things
can translate rotate and scale.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.740
All right, and
that's four unknowns, two points.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.070
Which if they, think about it.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.620
If I take a stick here, I can translate
it, rotate it and stretch it.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.700
I only need two points to know
the translation rotation stretch.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.790
Much more interesting is
what's referred to as affine.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.050
I have this rectangle and
when I move it,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.820
I can translate, rotate,
skew, all right?

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.560
And so, parallel lines remain parallel.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.790
And I have six unknowns.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.460
And, and there's, we,
we actually looked at the math before.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.890
One way to think about it is,
I take one triangle, and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.560
I map it to its corresponding triangle.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.910
And that's an affine transform.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.670
So the six unknowns, and
I can solve it with three points.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.190
And then finally, I know you're
all waiting for this, right?

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.310
Here it's written as perspective,
we can also write this as homography.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.700
Now you're seeing why we don't
have me writing anything.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.850
We did this before right?

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.750
We said if we have perspective
projection of a plane

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.170
to another plane that,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.980
that transformation is a four-point
transformation, eight unknowns and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.410
that's because it takes four and four
points therefore to recover homography.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.880
So each of these can be thought
of as transformations or

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.310
as motions within a region.
