00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.270
Let us again written to the center. Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. You

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.680
and I can quickly recognize, that this sentence is grammatically correct even as

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.070
it is semantically meaningless. How do we do it? Consider this mini-grammar.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.080
This is a small subset of the English language grammar consisting of just three

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.770
simple rules. The sentence can go into a noun phrase, followed by a verb phrase.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.120
A noun phase can be, optional adjectives, followed by a noun or a pronoun.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.290
The square bracket here means, optional. A verb phrase, composed of a verb,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.470
followed by optional adverb. The variables in this particular sentence,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.530
are the words. The values we assign to them are elliptical categories like verb,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.350
objective, noun and pronoun. If we can make a pastry for

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.690
this, that assigned values to this variables in a way that is consistent with

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.030
this grammar, then this particular sentence is grammatically correct.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.330
Let's try to make a pastry for this sentence. A sentence can a noun phrase, or

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.250
a word phrase. So we may say, that this is a noun phrase and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.930
this is word phrase. Of course at this particular point we do not know,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.510
where we should make this demarcation, what should go into the noun phrase,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.080
what should go into the word phrase? We know whether or

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.720
not, this demarcation is correct depending upon whether or not this noun phrase,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.700
and word phrase meet the low level lexical categories. So let's look at

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.150
colorless green ideas. We know that a noun phrase can go into one or

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.380
more adjectives, followed by a noun or pronoun. So we can look at a lexicon, and

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.880
know that ideas are a noun, so we say that this is a noun.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.280
We can look at a lexicon that tells us that colorless and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.130
green are adjectives, and so colorless and green are adjectives here.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.860
We have satisfied this part of the constraint. So I am ready for

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.700
the verb phrase, a verb phrase can be composed of a verb, followed by one or

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.910
more optional adverbs. We can look in the lexicon, and sleep is a verb, and

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.950
furiously is an adverb, so we have satisfied the constraints for

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.670
this particular part. Because we have satisfied the constraints,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.540
we know the top level demarcation of this as a noun phrase, and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.390
this as a verb phrase was correct. So the processing is not very top down here.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.170
It also has a bottom up component. In this way we are able to decide,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.310
that this particular sentence is grammatically correct because it satisfies

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.758
the constraints of [INAUDIBLE] grammar. Know that we have used knowledge of

00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:11.930
constraints, and the matter of constraint propagation, both for

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.780
visual processing and for language processing. This sentence method is very

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.420
general purpose in doing independent. Once we have done constraint propagation,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.090
to derive the parse tree for the sentence, then we can do additional processing.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.090
We can use this parse tree to support semantic analysis to build

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.630
an understanding, a semantic understanding, of the sentence.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.020
Similarly, in visual processing, once we have used the constraints for

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.270
doing line labelling. And recognize the surfaces and their orientations.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.450
We can then go on further and recognize the object in its 3D form.
