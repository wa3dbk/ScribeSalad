We can solve this problem like our other equations. First, we distribute the 2.

00:00:06.262 --> 00:00:11.855
2 times 90 is a 180, and 2 time negative x is negative 2 x. Here, I combine my

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:17.715
like terms, we add 2 x to both sides and we get a 180 plus x equals a 190. So, x

00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:19.870
is equal to 10, or 10 degrees.
