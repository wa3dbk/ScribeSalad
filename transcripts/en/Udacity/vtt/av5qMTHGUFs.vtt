00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.452
For the answer, imagine you have objects entering each stage of the pipeline at

00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:08.967
the same time and suddenly stage B takes 3 nanoseconds. After 1 nanosecond, the

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:14.032
object entering stage A is done processing, but stage B is still busy. So, the

00:00:14.032 --> 00:00:18.482
object coming out of stage A is blocked and has to wait. With stages C and D,

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:23.490
the objects move on through just fine. However, the object in stage B does not

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.626
enter stage C until 3 nanoseconds have passed. And that is in fact the time that

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:33.403
this whole pipeline will take for every object to come off it, is 3 nanoseconds.
