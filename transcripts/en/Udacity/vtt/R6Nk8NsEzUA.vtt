00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.860
What's an example of an interactive graphic that you've seen and

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.550
that tells a really compelling story?

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.920
&gt;&gt; One of my all time favorites is by Amanda Cox, Sean Carter, and

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.180
Kevin Quealy of the New York Times.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.230
I'll pull it up over here.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.620
It's actually from 2009,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.500
so you know, it seems like a long time ago, at this point.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.810
But it's an unemployment graphic.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.910
I think people just talk about it as the unemployment graphic.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.630
But it's called The Jobless Rate for People Like You.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.650
Well as, as you can see.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.770
So it's, it's really interesting.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.030
First of all it starts out giving you this line.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.140
So we can see over time from January 2007 to September 2009.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.320
We can see kind of okay the jobless rate has gone up.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.520
Unemployment has gone up.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.110
For all men and women overall.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.630
Right.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.820
But what's really beautiful and

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.350
compelling about this is that you can sort of you know,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.220
as soon as you mouse over this piece you know, you can interact with it,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.040
and you can start seeing like these different categories or groupings of people.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.750
And you can use these toggles up here.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.480
So I guess, okay well.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.650
You know, I'm interested in white women in this age group who, you know,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.680
are college graduates.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.718
So we can say, well, for that group, it's like, okay, the,

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:16.450
the employment rate is really pretty low, 3.6%.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.640
But we could change.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.770
Maybe we could say Hispanic men who are younger, for example.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.500
We can see the fluctuations over time for that group, and see that they,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.370
how much higher unemployment rate, at least as of 2009, right.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.650
So I think this is, this is really let's see.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.550
If we click into some of these I think this rescales to, yeah, so You know,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.410
unfortunately, you can see who has the highest unemployment rate.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.610
Like it's so high that we have to rescale the chart, right?

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.490
It's a black man, 15 to 24 without a high school degree.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.180
So, and it's really compelling because you can get a sense of the,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.290
kind of massive inequalities here?

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.690
But also, you know, the graphic works.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.010
Just on its own.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.670
Like, even if it weren't interactive,

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.210
this is the kind of thing you could see published in the paper.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.538
Like a static version, right?

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:11.350
And so you could say,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.330
okay, well, I can see, I can see the unemployment is going up.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.740
But as soon as you have a graphic and you can kind of,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.610
you know, find yourself inside that graphic, I think it makes it really.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.060
Really compelling.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.370
And just by tapping in a couple different categories and say, oh wow,

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.030
I'm in this group.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.870
This represents me and now I can see how I compare to the average and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.799
how I can compare to everybody else.
