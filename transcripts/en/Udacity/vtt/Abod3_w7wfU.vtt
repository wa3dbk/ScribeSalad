00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The next issue we're going to explore is basically purely selling my own views and opinions,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but the next issue we're going to explore is the question,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Can random testing inspire confidence?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And so what I said earlier in this course is the purpose of testing is to maximize

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the number of bugs found per amount of effort spent testing,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and so that's really what testing is all about.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
On the other hand, when we start to do a better and better job testing

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
especially using random testing, we start to get tempted to use those results

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
as justification to believe that we're creating good software.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What I want to talk about now is, is that ever justified, is that an inference that we can make?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What I think I can give is sort of a highly qualified yes answer to this question.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let's go through the qualifications.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If we have an API that we understand really well and we have a relatively small piece of code

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
For example we're doing unit testing of a data structure like a balanced tree

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and we have a strong and well-chosen collection of assertion embedded in that code

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we have a mature, well-tuned random tester, and we've measured coverage

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and shown that coverage is good then at least in some cases, I think we can conclude

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that the software is pretty good.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
What I mean basically by this is that I could or any of you could take the splay tree

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that we looked at for the queue or red ??? or something.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Do all of these things and develop a reasonably high degree of confidence as described.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If any of these conditions isn't met, I would strongly doubt

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
whether random testing can inspire confidence.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If you don't have a small code, let's say that instead of small code

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we have would be acrobat reader, there's no way, even if we have all these other things

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that we could possibly get any confidence in the quality of that software using random testing.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
For example, if we don't have a small code, if we have for example adobe acrobat reader

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
then even all of these other things were true,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
there is no way that random testing would inspire the confidence in the quality of the product.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The thing we should keep in mind is since these conditions for inspiring confidence

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
are quite restrictive, we never just do random testing.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We always use it to augment other testing methods that might be even better

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
at showing up some of the weakness of random testing.
