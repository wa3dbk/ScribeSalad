00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
You could have implemented NSUserDefaults in a number of ways.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.290
Here's how I did it. First I added a method to the app delegate to check if

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.490
this is the first time this app is run before. This is pretty much the same code

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.109
used in the example app.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.920
The only thing I changed is what I said to be the default value. Here I set

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.329
float to be the default value for slider value key. Remember this is

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.210
important, so that you can check this user default throughout the rest of your

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.000
code, without wondering whether the value is set or not.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.599
Next after looking around the PlaySoundsViewController

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.460
I thought it made sense to check for the slider value in ViewDidLoad.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.549
And using NSUserDefaults floatForKey() method, I set the sliderView.value equal to

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:48.420
NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults.floatForKey(SliderValueKey).

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.259
SliderValueKey is just a constant that I used to store the key string I’ll be using

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:56.189
again and again. For saving the slider state, there are a few methods that would work.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.979
If you save it in slider move

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.670
you will always be storing the most up to date slider value. If you stored in

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.599
play audio, you will see the last value that the user chose to listen to.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:11.670
I chose to save it in play audio and I used

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.810
NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults.setFloat(sliderView.value, forKey:SliderValueKey)

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.599
to set the user default to the current sliderView.value, and let's run it.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:33.370
“Is this a persistent yet?”

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.390
“I hope so.” “I hope so.”

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.989
And we see that the slider position is in the same place
