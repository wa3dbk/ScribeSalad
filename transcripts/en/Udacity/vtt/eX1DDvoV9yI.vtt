00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.292
When a is 0, all f of x ends up being is 0 to the x. And that actually just

00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:10.100
equals 0 for every value of x except for 0, since 0 to the 0 power is not

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:18.840
defined. When a equals 1, f of x just equals 1 to the x. And that simplifies to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.540
1. Since both of these are constant functions, they're just horizontal lines.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.860
That's not very interesting. Horizontal lines are definitely not exponential

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.959
functions. That's why a can't equal 0 or 1 for this general form of our

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:33.029
exponential function.
