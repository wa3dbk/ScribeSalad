00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Finding things like the max of a list or the min or the second largest or the second to last smallest,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
they are all examples of what are called order statistics.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Statistics summaries of the values in a list that depend on the order that they are sorted.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This notion is generalizing min and max, so the min can be expressed as order statistic 1.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The second smallest element in the list is order statistic 2.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The median is order statistic like n/2 floor.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The second largest is order statistic n-1, and the max is order statistic n.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
To give you a chance to play with this idea a little bit of order statistics,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'd like you to write some Python code to find the second most popular name.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm going to give you the list of the most popular names

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
given to babies in the US born in 1995, it's a yob, for year of birth, 1995.txt

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and if you take a look at the file, you should be able to download this and take a look at the format.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's pretty simple, the name and the sex and essentially a measure of how popular the name is,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and what you want to find is the second most popular female name given in the US in 1995.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Once your program is completed, it should be able to output the name,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and I want you to just check off the name that your program returns.
