00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.581
And the answer is no. So even path coverage's stronger criteria

00:00:03.581 --> 00:00:06.376
that we saw is not enough to reveal this problem. And why

00:00:06.376 --> 00:00:08.526
is that? So let me go back to a concept that

00:00:08.526 --> 00:00:12.491
I mentioned in a previous lesson, the cost of exhaustive testing. Exhaustive

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:15.236
testing is really the only way in which we can exercise

00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:18.230
all of the possible behaviors of a program. So we can say

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.884
even though it might sound like topology, that only exhaustive testing is

00:00:21.884 --> 00:00:25.710
exhausted. All the coverage criteria that we saw are just process and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.900
just approximation of a complete test. So test is a best effort kind

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.180
of activity. Coverage criteria help you assess

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.430
how well you tested but once more,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.060
test can only reveal issues, can only reveal problems. You can never show the

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.530
absence of problems. And that's something is

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.377
important to remember when we do testing.
