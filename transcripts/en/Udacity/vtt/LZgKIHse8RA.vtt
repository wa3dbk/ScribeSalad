00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.844
The first answer is 3x, and our second answer is 2 plus 2 times the cube root

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:10.280
of 6. Great thinking for getting those two correct. Now, these were a little

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.307
bit tricky because you had to keep in mind we had cube roots. We can multiply

00:00:14.307 --> 00:00:20.580
these two radicals together since the indexes match, so we'll get 27x cubed.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.676
The factor of 3 appears three times underneath the radical as is the factor of

00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:30.600
x. This means we pull out one 3 and one x to get 3x. This should also make

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.112
sense. We've seen the cube root of 27 before, and we know that's 3. And using

00:00:35.112 --> 00:00:40.000
power divided by root, we'll have 3 divided by 3 which is x to the 1. For our

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.116
second problem, we'll distribute the cube root of 2 to each of these terms. So,

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:49.735
we'll have the cube root of 8 and the cube root of 48. We know the cube root of

00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:52.815
8 is simply 2, and we can split up the cube root of 48 into cube root of 8

00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:57.987
times 6. We use our product rule to split this up into cube root of 8 times the

00:00:57.987 --> 00:01:03.106
cube root of 6, and simplify once again to get our final result. You might not

00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:06.600
have always shown this step throughout your problem solving, and that's okay.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.900
You just really want to be careful when you take cube roots of numbers. Put the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.500
factor on the outside, and leave anything else inside the radical.
