So you just checked 1 and negative 1 off our list of possible rational zeros

00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:08.119
for this function. We know that neither one of these works. So let's move o to

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.841
one of our next four possibilities. Why don't we try out one half? Is one half

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:14.883
a root or a zero of this function?
