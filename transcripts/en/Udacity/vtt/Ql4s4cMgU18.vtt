00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.090
Today we'll talk about Analogical Reasoning.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.010
Analogical Reasoning involves understanding new problems,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.990
in terms of family of problems. It also involves addressing new problems, but

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.239
transferring knowledge of relationships from known problems across domains.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.320
We introduced a notion of transfer previously in explanation based learning.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.175
We also have talked about Case Based Reasoning.

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:26.420
Today we'll talk about transfer in a much more general manner.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.860
We'll start by talking about similarity then revisit case based reasoning.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.780
Then we'll talk through the overall process of analogical reasoning,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.970
including retrieval, and mapping, and transport. Then we'll close by

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.680
talking about a specific application of analogy, called Design by Analogy.
