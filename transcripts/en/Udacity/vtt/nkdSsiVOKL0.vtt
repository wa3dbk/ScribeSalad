00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.740
Okay, so here's my solution to that.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.277
I started by adding a constant in; K equals 16, like we talked about.

00:00:07.277 --> 00:00:10.380
So now if you think about this, we're going to have thread blocks,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.983
each of which is responsible for a tile in the matrix.

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:15.204
Let's draw that.

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:18.012
We'll be processing this matrix in blocks called tiles,

00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:21.384
each tile corresponding to a single in the thread block.

00:00:21.384 --> 00:00:23.331
Here's the new kernel I wrote.

00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:25.355
Very similar to the previous one.

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:29.369
The difference is that now I need to compute the INJ values,

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.175
not just the I values,

00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:34.835
and that computation involves using the block index as well as the thread index,

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:39.509
so the block index times K plus the thread index plus x.x

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:41.577
gives me my I value.

00:00:41.577 --> 00:00:43.784
Similarly, I get my J value from the Y,

00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:48.167
and so now the threads in my grid have an overall index, X and Y,

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:52.081
as well as an index within their block, which is the thread index.

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:54.225
So I am going to compute that X and Y,

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:56.801
and that's going to correspond to the INJ of the output matrix,

00:00:56.801 --> 00:00:59.378
and that's the calculation that's going on here.

00:00:59.378 --> 00:01:03.167
And finally I do the same final calculation that I've done all along.

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:09.457
I go and grab an element from the input matrix, equal to the coordinates IJ,

00:01:09.457 --> 00:01:12.041
and I write that into the output matrix,

00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:16.908
the location of the output matrix corresponding to element JI,

00:01:16.908 --> 00:01:19.088
and here's how I'm going to call it.

00:01:19.088 --> 00:01:22.990
Now I need to define the number of blocks and the number of threads,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.960
which is simply N over K, N over K.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.447
I'm being a little lazy here; you can tell.

00:01:28.447 --> 00:01:31.934
I'm assuming that N is a multiple of K.

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:34.910
There's K by K threads in a block,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.808
and now when I launch, instead of launching a single thread, I launch blocks threads.

00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:41.150
N over K by N over K,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.509
and instead of launching 1,024 elements or N elements,

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.544
I'm going to launch K by K elements per block.

00:01:48.544 --> 00:01:50.719
Let's go and compile and run this.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.725
Okay, now we're talking.

00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:55.753
So now we're down to about 0.67 milliseconds.

00:01:55.753 --> 00:01:57.528
Let's make a note.

00:01:57.528 --> 00:01:59.592
And thinking about what we've done here is

00:01:59.592 --> 00:02:02.523
we've now extracted the maximum amount of parallelism from the application, right?

00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:06.030
We started with a single serial code, 1 thread doing all the work.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.453
We switched to a code that used 1 thread per row of the input matrix,

00:02:11.453 --> 00:02:14.351
and now we're down to something that uses 1 thread per element.

00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:17.307
There's really no more parallelism that we can extract here,

00:02:17.307 --> 00:02:20.905
And you can see that increasing the parallelism has really helped us.
