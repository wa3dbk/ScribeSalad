Congratulations on making
it to the last lesson.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.600
In this lesson, you're going to iterate
on your previous work with Meme Me and

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.808
get the app portfolio ready by adding
the ability to view sent memes.

00:00:10.808 --> 00:00:14.690
That might sound pretty simple, but
the sent memes feature is a tricky one.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.800
It employs a tab view,
a table view, a collection view,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.590
not to mention implementing navigation,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.000
so you'll need to extend your UIKit
knowledge in each of these areas.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.710
We'll take you through each
topic one step at a time.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.611
Let's start with a close look at this
updated version of the app, Meme Me 2.0.
