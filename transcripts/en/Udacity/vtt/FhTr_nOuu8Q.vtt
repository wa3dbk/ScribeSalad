00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.930
All right.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.200
Well, using all the skills that you've
learned throughout this course,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.820
it's time to make some final
tweaks to the home town site.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.850
To start off, I want you to
update the sports score table.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.050
Go ahead and put your favorite sports
teams in, and make sure it's responsive.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.530
I've also added another column into
the sports score table just to

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.370
make things a little bit more difficult.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.270
Next up, double check your text.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.540
Is there any text that's too long?

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.350
If so, find a way to make it fit
a little bit more naturally.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.950
This is also a great place to
add some minor breakpoints.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.240
Add at least one, or

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.840
I'm sure if you keep trying, you could
find a lot more than just one to add.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.490
Lastly, try replacing a few of
the images with responsive images.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.500
If you haven't completed the responsive
images course, check out the responsive

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.940
images section of Web Fundamentals
using the link in the instructor notes.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.370
And when you're done, make sure you
share your project in the forums.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.150
That's the best way to get feedback and
make improvements.
