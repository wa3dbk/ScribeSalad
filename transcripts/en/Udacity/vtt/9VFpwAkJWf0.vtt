00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.910
Earlier we discussed syntax and
semantics and

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.930
said that syntax is structure
while semantics is meaning.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.930
The HL7 Reference Implementation Model,
or RIM,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.180
defines the semantics of a common
set of administrative financial and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.240
clinical concepts in order
to foster interoperability.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.800
It consists of five abstract concepts.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.210
Each happening is an Act.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.040
Examples include procedures,
observations and medications.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.220
Acts are connected through
Act Relationships.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.860
Participation defines the context for
an Act author, performer,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.800
subject or location.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.760
The participants have Roles,
such as patient, provider and so on.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.200
And Roles are played by Entities,
which could be persons, organizations,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.690
material, places or even devices.
