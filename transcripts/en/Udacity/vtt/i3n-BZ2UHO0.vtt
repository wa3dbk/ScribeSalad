Hi, I'm Sean Bennet - Course Architect with Udacity

00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:06.292
I'm Colt McAnlis - Developer Advocate at Google

00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:08.544
I'm Peter Lubbers - a Program Manager at Google.

00:00:08.544 --> 00:00:14.368
Now HTML5 has a rich suite of functionality to build amazing experiences on the web.

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:19.134
This course is about leveraging those tools to build fun engaging games.

00:00:19.134 --> 00:00:22.460
Now Colt here is going to be acting as our game expert

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.463
Hi I like games!

00:00:24.463 --> 00:00:27.865
And Peter is going to be acting as our HTML 5 expert.

00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:29.239
I love HTML 5.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.281
Now there are two different ways you can enter this course. If you're not already familiar

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:38.100
with JavaScript or modern browsers, then we have an optional JavaScript crash

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.239
course for you to take. Now if you're already familiar with all of that, then

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.374
you can go ahead and skip that. And go straight to our canvas unit.

00:00:45.374 --> 00:00:47.420
Can't wait to see you in class!
