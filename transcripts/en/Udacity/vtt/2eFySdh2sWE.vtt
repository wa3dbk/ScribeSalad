00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In that last analysis of grid graphs,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we ended up discovering that the number of edges is 2n - 2√n,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which is such a terrible function, but the fact of the matter is

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
as these analyses get more and more complicted

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
getting detailed answers like this is more and more cumbersome.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Researchers have worked out a scheme for talking about functions in a much more

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
high level way while still being completely rigorous but without it getting bogged down

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
in all the details, and this is the notion of asymptotic growth.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You may have heard it described in the form of Big Oh notation,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and we're going to get to Big Oh in a moment, but we need to start off with Big Theta.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Θ(g(n)) is actually a set of functions, specifically the set of functions that grow

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
equally quickly as g(n).

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
To be a bit more formal about it, we say that some function f(n) is in the set

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
of functions equally fast growing as g(n),

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
if and only if there are some constants c1 and c2 and some threshold n0

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
such that for any n bigger than n0, we have something that looks like this--

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the function f(n) for all these values of n--all these big values of n--

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
is sandwiched between c1 * g(n) and c2 * g(n).

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
To illustrate this idea with a picture imagine we have some function f(n).

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It grows. As n gets bigger, f(n) gets bigger.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We also have some function g(n) that we can multiply by c1 or we can multiply

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
by some bigger number c2.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
What we find is that once we get out to the right of some threshold n0

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
f(n) is always between c2g(n) and c1g(n).

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In the beginning maybe weird things happen, but once we get out far enough asymptotically

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
in the limit as things get really big, f(n) lies between c2g(n) and c1g(n).

00:01:54.000 --> 09:59:59.000
If that's the case, if such c1, c2, and n0 exist, then we can say that f(n) is in Θ(g(n)).
