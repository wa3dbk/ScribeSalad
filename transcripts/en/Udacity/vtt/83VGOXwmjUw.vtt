00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.452
Our mean difference as you found earlier is negative 2.72. For the lower bound

00:00:05.452 --> 00:00:09.807
we'll subtract the T critical value times the standard error, we found before

00:00:09.807 --> 00:00:16.170
that the T critical value is 2.064 when there are 24 degrees of freedom. And

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.122
then we'll multiply this by S the standard deviation of the differences. divide

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:27.326
by the square root of 25. This gives us about negative 4.24, then we'll do the

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:34.263
same for the upper bound of this confidence interval. Negative 2.72 plus 2.064

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:43.247
times 3.69 divided by the square root of 25. If we round to the hundreths

00:00:43.247 --> 00:00:48.802
place, this gives us negative 1.20. We can conclude then, by saying that on

00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:53.488
average, users will make around four to one fewer errors on the QWERTY keyboard

00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:57.498
than on the alphabeticle keyboard.
