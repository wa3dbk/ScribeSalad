00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.562
So far, we've learned what happens when we substitute in special values of x

00:00:03.562 --> 00:00:07.694
that make the function equal to zero. And we've seen that this connects

00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:11.574
directly to factors. Now we're going to look at how to find special values,

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:15.338
like a in this case. Working backwards from what we have written here, if we

00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:18.133
could look at a function and find its factors, then we would know these special

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:23.108
values. So let's figure out how to do that. Now you already know how to factor

00:00:23.108 --> 00:00:26.600
quadratic expressions and you had a lot of practice with that earlier in the

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.259
course. So let's see if we can look at another function and use similar methods

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.259
to this to find one factor and then figure out what that factor needs to be

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:38.579
multiplied by to give us the original function. Let's say we have a function

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.548
that's already in factored form maybe it's f of x equals x minus 6 times x plus

00:00:42.548 --> 00:00:47.765
2 times x minus 4. If this is the case and we decide to multiply this right

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:52.931
hand side out, and then simplify, what is the constant term that we'll get? Now

00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:55.604
what you want to be looking for here is a shortcut to do this. So that you

00:00:55.604 --> 00:00:59.192
don't have to actually multiply out everything. Think about which combinations

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.819
of terms here are going to give us just constants.
