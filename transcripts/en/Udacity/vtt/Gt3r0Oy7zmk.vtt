00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.540
We talked about these different methods,
something you know,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.030
something you have,
those are called factors.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.020
The first one is sort of
the secret you know factor.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.050
The second is something you have factor.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.580
The third is who you are factor.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.570
So it doesn't have to
be just one factor.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.520
You can actually have
a multi-factor authentication.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.110
One of the quiz questions,
the smart phone and PIN for

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.740
example, the password and
the PIN that is sent or

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.240
the code that is sent to you,
the password is something you know.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.900
The PIN that is sent to you on the smart
phone is based on the smart phone which

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.560
is something you have, for example.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.720
So you can use more than one factor to
actually make authentication stronger.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.280
So, as we said we use more than
one method, you type password but

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.840
also send code via SMS, and
this code goes to your phone,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.290
actually Gmail when you
create an account uses this.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.230
These are called phone verified
accounts or PVAs, mainly

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.380
to provide protection against bots
that create a lot of these accounts.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.820
So this is multi-factor,
because it's not just a password, but

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.880
also this code that comes
to a device that you have.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.290
So that's the second factor.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.750
Your ATM card and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.250
PIN that you use to get money out of
an ATM machine is actually a two factor.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.290
The PIN is something you know,
the card itself is something you have.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.630
So these are two factors.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.800
There's another example of
a multi-factor authentication.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.220
The other methods that use
things like where you are,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.570
your location and IP address of
the machine, OS fingerprint,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.900
these sort of add a little bit of
more to the authentication process.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.040
So when you have multi factor
authentication of course that attacker

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.030
must defeat both to successfully
compromise the authentication method

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.650
we have in place.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.030
So the authentication we talked
about sort of going to the system,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.920
having a trusted path to the system,
providing the password, fortunately,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.730
a lot of times you do authentication
over the network where the system

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.660
may be thousands of miles away from you.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.260
In fact, a lot of remote services
we access whether it's our email or

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.280
our banking system and so on are of
course, we don't walk up to them.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.770
So, what happens in this case?

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.720
We don't have a trusted
path to the system,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.410
remember we sent physical wires from
your keyboard to your machine right in

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.780
front of you in close proximity,
That's how we get that trusted path.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.420
The network is open and, obviously,
the same thing doesn't hold there.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.120
So we don't have a trusted path,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.560
especially when we access
in remote services.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.270
So network authentication
introduces a new problem.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.630
But how do you deal with the absence
of this trusted part that we've been

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.424
talking about?

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:37.420
Well, actually, we need crypto to
secure the network communication.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.625
So when you talk about network
security in a different lesson,

00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:41.995
we're going to address this.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.805
Of course you have to worry
about different kind of threats,

00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:47.285
such as man-in-the-middle and
things like that.

00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:50.285
But the reason I want to mention,
although we're going to

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:53.880
cover this in network security topic,
is that authentication

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.580
relies on this fundamental
requirement of this trusted path.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.840
In a network,
you're not going to have that.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.780
So you'll have to do something else
about the lack of the trusted path, or

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.038
some method you have to find to
secure the network over which you're

00:03:07.038 --> 00:03:09.540
going to send the evidence for
authenticating yourself.
