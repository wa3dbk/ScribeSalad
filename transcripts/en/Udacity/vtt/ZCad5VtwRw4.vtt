Instead of writing f of x equals the absolute value of x, we could write f of x

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:08.274
equals negative x for x is less than 0, and x, for x is greater than or equal

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:14.570
to 0. Notice that writing the function in this piecewise form actually tells us

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.688
what it means to take the absolute value of a number. The absolute value signs

00:00:19.688 --> 00:00:25.290
switch the sign of negative numbers and preserve a value of positive numbers.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.959
That's pretty cool.
