Okay, let's see how one would write such a comment. The method is called

00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:09.240
addGas. And we need to describe it's purpose in plain English. So, just say

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.970
Adds gas to the tank of this car. The method has a parameter, and for every

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.220
parameter, we'll need an @param clause. Put in the name of the parameter, and

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.720
then a description. The amount of gas to add. Do we need a @return clause? No,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.780
because this method, returns void. That's the Java.comment. When you generate

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.198
the documentation again, now the comment is included in the webpage.
