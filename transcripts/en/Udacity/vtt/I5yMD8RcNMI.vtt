So, having one pipeline is effective in giving you extra production. But it can

00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:08.668
only go so fast. So, we can produce even more boxes by buying more factory space

00:00:08.668 --> 00:00:12.902
and creating more assembly lines. Gpus are designed to use these techniques of

00:00:12.902 --> 00:00:16.453
pipelines and parallelism to get extremely fast rendering speeds.
