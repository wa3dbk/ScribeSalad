00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.550
So in the previous video, we described how the probability that our estimate for

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.730
beta deviates from the true value, is the following.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.160
The probability that x bar minus the true beta star is greater than epsilon,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.970
is less than or equal to 1 divided by 4 and epsilon squared.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.090
We want to get a feel for

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.760
how many data points that we need to be able to say something with accuracy.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.650
Let's suppose that we want to deviate from the true beta by no more than 0.01.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.560
And that the probability of that occurring should be no more then 10%.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.030
How many data points do we need?

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.750
