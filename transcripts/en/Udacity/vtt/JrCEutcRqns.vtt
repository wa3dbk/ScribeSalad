00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.590
Let us try a couple of simple exercises. So here we have A, B and

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.610
we want to find a truth value of A or not B.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.190
Given these values for A and B, can you please write down the truth values for

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.050
A or not B. And similarly, for not A and not B
