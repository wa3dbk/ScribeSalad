00:00:00.715 --> 00:00:02.590
&gt;&gt; Okay, Michael, what's your answer?

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.570
&gt;&gt; Alright. So. Again, a lot feels like a good

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.338
answer, it's already written down on the left. But it's

00:00:09.338 --> 00:00:11.740
also wait, wait, may be we can quantify this. So

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.990
if it were. Maybe one way to think about this

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.370
is if each of the, each of those empty boxes

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.510
there, is either true or false. It's kind of like a

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.960
bit. And we're asking how many different bit patterns can

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.800
we make? And in general, it's two to the number

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.100
of positions, but here the number of positions is 2 to the n. So it ought to

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.510
be 2, to the 2 to the n. Which is that the same as 4 to the n?

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.446
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:36.476
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:36.476 --> 00:00:38.653
&gt;&gt; But you're right. It's 2 to the 2

00:00:38.653 --> 00:00:42.530
to the n. So it's a double exponential and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:50.820
it's not the same thing as 4 to the nth. It's actually 2 to the 2 to the nth.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.650
Now how big of a number do you think that is Michael?

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.250
&gt;&gt; I'm going to go again to my go to place and just say a lot.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.810
&gt;&gt; It is, in fact, a lot and I'm

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.640
going, I actually, I'm going to look over here, and I'm

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.930
going to tell you. That for even a small value

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.740
of n, this gets to be a really big number.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.740
&gt;&gt; So for, for one, it's 2 to the 2

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.230
to the 1, which is 4. That's not a big number.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.690
&gt;&gt; That's true. What about two?

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.640
&gt;&gt; For

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.300
two, it's 2 to the 2 to the 2. So 2 to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.070
the 2 is 4, so it's 2 to the 4, which is 16.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.850
&gt;&gt; What about three?

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.480
&gt;&gt; Alright, so that's two to the 8th, which is 256?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.350
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. So that's growing pretty fast, don't you think?

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.410
&gt;&gt; Sure, but those aren't big numbers yet.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.120
&gt;&gt; What if I told you, [LAUGH] that for n equals

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.148
6, 2 to the 2 to the n was, I'm going to start

00:01:42.148 --> 00:01:52.148
writing it, okay? 18466744073709551616.

00:02:02.302 --> 00:02:03.599
&gt;&gt; Holy monkeys.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:06.863
&gt;&gt; Yes, that is in fact the technical term for this number,

00:02:06.863 --> 00:02:10.038
it's a holy monkey. It is a very, very big number.

00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:12.120
So 2 to the n grows very fast. We already called

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.150
that evil. 2 to the 2 to the n is a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.660
double exponential and it's super evil. It grows very, very, very,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.930
very, very fast. So what's the point of this exercise, Michael?

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.810
It's, it's to point that the space of decision trees, the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.810
hypothesis space that we've chosen, is very expressive because there's lots

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.470
of different functions that you can represent. But that also means

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.450
we have to have some clever way to search

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.150
among them. And that gets us back to our

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.050
notion of an algorithm with actually going to very

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.300
smartly go through and pick out which decision tree. Because

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.820
if we aren't very smart about it and we

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.130
start eliminating whole decision trees along the way. Then we're

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.560
going to have to look it to billions upon, billions

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.090
upon, billions upon, billion upon, billion of possible decision choice.
