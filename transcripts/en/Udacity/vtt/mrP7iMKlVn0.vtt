00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.261
It turns out you can do one half of the job in one hour's time. We can get one

00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:08.674
half by drawing a diagram to help us out. We know that it takes two hours for

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:13.283
us to do the entire assignment. So, if two hours passes, then we've finished

00:00:13.283 --> 00:00:18.020
our complete assignment; both of these bars would be full. So, what we can do

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.790
is we can take our entire two hours and split it up into one hour increments.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.262
Each of these would represent one hour. And each of these on the corresponding

00:00:27.262 --> 00:00:30.734
side would represent the amount of work for the fraction being done in that

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:36.930
hour. So if we split our time in half we could split our assignment in half.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.870
We'll know that we'll finish half the assignment in one hour. And then the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.282
other half in the next hour. So this is how we know that in one hour we only

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:49.100
finish half of the assignment. Great work if you got that fraction.
