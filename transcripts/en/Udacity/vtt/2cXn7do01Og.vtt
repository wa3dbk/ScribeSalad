00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If you have assertions in your code, not only can you detect errors much more easily

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but you can also test your code much more thoroughly.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In particular, you can separate two things. A test consists of two parts.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
First we need to generate on execution and second we need to check the outcome.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
With assertions in your code, checking the results is already done

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so we can focus on generating the tests.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let me illustrate with a very, very simple example.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The idea is that we're going to take a square root function with assertions integrated

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and just use random testing to test it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Here's a very, very simple implementation of the square root function.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We simply invert the built-in Python square root function from the math module,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and we have set up appropriate assertions to check for the precondition and for the post condition

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now for the test driver, I have set up a loop with 1000 iterations

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and we generate random numbers in the range of 0 to 9,999.99.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This is random with random function which returned a value between 0 and 1.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This is the floating point number and it comes from the random module

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and then when we feed this random number into a square root function turning assuming the result in z

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Note that we don't do any assertions down here

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because the assertions up here have already take care of everything.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
When all test are successful, we print out done.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So this is our test and the question is, what's going to happen?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Is it the program terminates gracefully, output is done, all test are fast.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Is it that the square root precondition fail? Is it that the square root post condition fails?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Or thinking of Python, do we see something completely different. Over to you.
