00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.780
We are now ready to formally
define the Class P.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.571
Most precisely, P is the set of
languages recognized by an order n to

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:12.955
the k deterministic Turing machine for
some natural number k.

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:16.230
There are several important things
to note about this definition.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.260
First, is that P is a set of languages.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.720
Intuitively, we talk about
P as a set of problems, but

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.360
to be rigorous, we have to ultimately
define it in terms of languages.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.030
A second point is
the word deterministic.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.220
We haven't seen a nondeterministic
Turing machine yet, but one is coming.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.640
Deterministic just means that
given a current state and

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.040
tape symbol being read there's only one
transition for the machine to follow,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.440
but in order n to the k time Turing
machine here I mean, a Turing machine

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.210
with running time order n to the k as
we defined the terms a minute ago.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.590
Perhaps the most interesting thing about
this definition is the choice of for

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.000
any k in the natural numbers.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.780
Why is this the right definition?

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.780
After all, if k is 100,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.360
then deciding the language
isn't tractable in practice.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.860
The answer is that,
the notion of the class P

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.400
doesn't exactly capture what
is tractable in practice.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.230
It's not clear that any mathematical
definition would stand the test of

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.770
time in this regard,
given how often computers change.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.680
Or how it could be relevant in so
many context.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.020
This choice however does have
some very nice properties.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.840
First, is that it matches tractability
better than one might think.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.570
In practice k is usually low for
polynomial algorithms and

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.450
there are plenty of interesting
problems not known to be in P.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.290
Second, is that the definition is
robust to changes in the model.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.710
That is to say P is the same for
single tape, multitape machines,

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.390
random access machines, and so forth.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.740
In fact, we pointed out
that the running times for

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.900
each of those models are polynomially
related when we introduced them.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.820
Lastly, P has a nice property of closure
under the composition of algorithms.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.385
If one algorithm calls another
algorithm as a subroutine a polynomial

00:02:02.385 --> 00:02:06.329
number of times, and
that algorithm is still polynomial and

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.282
the problem it solves is in P.

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:12.404
In other words, if we do something
efficient a reasonably small number of

00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:16.300
times then the overall
solution will be efficient.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.880
P is exactly the smallest
class of problems

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.640
containing linear time algorithms and
which is closed under composition.
