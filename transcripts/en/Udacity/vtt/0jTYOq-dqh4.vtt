00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.380
Couple of implementation issues.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.990
In general, warping is not,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.390
warping is one of those things that
in principle should be really easy.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.790
In practice you always make mistakes,
I will say that MATLAB does a very fine

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.370
job of, of allowing you to do
warping in particular ways so

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.340
if you are using MATLAB or
Octave it's easy.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.820
And I think within python nonpie
openCV accomplishes as well.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.700
The other thing,
in order to make this work and

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.365
actually we'll get to this when
we do the whole multi-scale.

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:31.560
Is its often useful to sort of
take a nice bit of a low-pass

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.680
filter of your images.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.880
Smooth things out,
why do you want to do that?

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.250
To get sort of your smoother
derivatives as, as things work.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.590
And we'll talk more
about that next time.
