00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.080
If you recall when we looked at the
application, we had three buttons across

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.520
the top of the screen, and we had
the map fragment itself underneath them.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.860
And the basic UI that Android Studio
created for us had a single text view.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:12.800
So delete that and

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.770
replace it with the layout code
that's in the instructor notes.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.170
This is made up of a LinearLayout which
is set to be in vertical orientation.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.490
And within this LinearLayout I then
have another LinearLayout at the top

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.490
which contains the three buttons.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.960
And as you can see my three buttons
are Button Map, Button Satellite, and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.530
Button Hybrid.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.950
And then underneath this LinearLayout
for the buttons is the fragment itself

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.080
containing the map fragment similar
to what we've been doing earlier on.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.770
So I have a linear layout putting the
buttons on top and the map underneath.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.010
And then the second linear layout
within the first has the buttons

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.980
horizontally stacked side by side,
as you can see here.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.770
So now if I run the application
you'll see I have the basic map

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.960
with the three buttons.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.510
They won't do anything yet, because I
haven't written the code behind them.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.630
Try it out yourself, see what happens,
and check your error log for details.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.530
Typically if you have problems it's
the API key hasn't been setup properly.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.990
And after we wire up the buttons
we'll take a look at how to do that.
