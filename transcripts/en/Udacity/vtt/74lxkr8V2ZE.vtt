As we've talked about many times before, domain just means allowable inputs.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.874
It's a set of values that you can plug in for the independent variable into

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:12.292
your function. For example, with these functions we've been dealing with

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:17.166
recently, the domain of f of x is all the real numbers. We can plug in any real

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:22.262
number for x. And get a real number out from the function. Now, can you tell me

00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:25.796
what the domain of g of x, where g of x equals the square root of 4 minus x

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:30.466
squared is? Please write this in interval notation.
