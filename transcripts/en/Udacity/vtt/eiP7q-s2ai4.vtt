00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now that you've gotten a bit of a taste for this,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
let's check in with someone who toils in the trenches of the real world.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm here at Mozilla with Steve Fink,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and one of the topics that we cover in class is debugging or testing--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
making small, convenient test cases that are going to lead us to a bug

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or a defect in our program. That's tricky even for small classroom examples.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It can be really difficult in the real world.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Steve, have you run into problems like this in your job?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Sure, and in fact right now I'm dealing with a particular test program

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that went to a great deal of effort to kind of re-implement the algorithm that it's testing,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which is great in terms of comparing the C++ implementation

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and this JavaScript test program and giving you a yes/no answer--

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
it works/it doesn't work.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But if you actually do have a bug, it can be a bit of a pain tracking it down

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
just because, okay, you have a failure somewhere in the test;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
now you have to figure out what the test program is actually doing

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to figure out why it made the particular invocations into the C++ engine

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that resulted in the behavior that it's actually testing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So in many cases, it's actually easier just to have a brain dead, simple

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
series of call this, call this, call this, call this

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
rather than for each of these items call this if this is true

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and expect this output if--

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This is where the re-implementation of the algorithm comes.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Let me give a specific example.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This was a test of typed array code,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and if you access outside of the bounds of a typed array,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
then it should give you a range error. &gt;&gt;An exception.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Yeah, an exception, which of type range error.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And so this test program just went through an array of different possible inputs

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and then said, "Well, based on this logic, if this index is higher than this number,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
"then expect range error; otherwise, expect this value that it pulled out of the array."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So the actual test invocation right there is array element i

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
should be retrieved from this typed array,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and then you should get the result based on element j of this array.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And it turns out, no, I didn't throw the right error. There was a problem.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But figuring out, "Okay, so what exact element were you looking for

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
"and what did you actually expect to find based on this other array?"

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
was very indirect, very difficult.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It would have been easier if it was just a dumb, simple series of statements saying,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
"Pull this element out, expect this error. Pull this element out, expect this value."

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And in fact, that's kind of what I plan to do is instrument the test case itself

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to generate a series of silly, stupid linear statements

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and generate a new test case out of that and then throw away the original

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
because as clever and as easy to modify as it is, it's not actually helpful

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
when you're trying to track down a particular bug.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It's an excellent point.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
In one of the things we cover in class you'll notice that in class

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
most of our test cases are relatively small and simple.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And this is good advice.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Sometimes it's better to have 2 test cases--1 for each feature--

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
than to try to combine them together and then have to tease apart an interaction later on.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Yeah. It also makes it much easier to do, for example, binary search.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
You can whack off half of the test file if it is a very simple, straightforward test file.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
If it's all interrelated, then it's really hard to take off half at a time. &gt;&gt;Exactly.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We'll get a chance to see in class commenting out parts of a test file

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
to see if it still causes an error.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
In a linear test file or just a sequence of assignments, that's much easier to do

00:03:52.000 --> 09:59:59.000
than if there's a lot of complicated control flow.
