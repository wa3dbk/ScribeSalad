00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.090
So far, we've been looking at
intersections of two lines in 2D.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.120
But what happens if we
introduce a third line?

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.272
Let's look at the system
of equations Ax + By = k1,

00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:18.210
Cx + Dy = k2, and Ex + Fy = k3.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.790
Now in general,
unless AB and CD happen to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.860
be parallel vectors, the first two lines
will have a single intersection point.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.390
Similarly, unless AB and
EF are parallel, the first and

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.070
third lines will have
a single intersection point.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.670
And likewise the second and third
lines will have a single intersection

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.472
unless CD and EF are parallel.

00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:47.280
However, there's no guarantee that these
intersection points will all coincide.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.720
Sometimes they can as in this set
of lines that all pass through

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.980
a common point.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.330
More generally, as in the set of lines,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.170
the three intersection
points are all distinct.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.820
Since systems of linear equations are
questions about common intersections,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.200
that is points that are common to
all the objects being considered,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.570
this latter case would have
an empty common intersection.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.290
To describe systems with new
common point of intersection,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.030
we use the term inconsistent.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.610
We will be using this
terminology in the future.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.610
So, I wanted to go ahead and
introduce it here.
