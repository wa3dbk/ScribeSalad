00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.758
Substituting in e to the 2 x equals e squared, and 5 e to the x equals 5 u. We

00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:12.974
end up with u squared minus 5 u plus 6 equals 0. Now it's time to factor. This

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:18.058
is equivalent to u minus 3 times u minus 2 equals 0. Then it's super easy to

00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:24.226
solve for u. We have u minus 3 equals 0 and u minus 2 equals 0. That gives us u

00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:27.259
equals 3 or u equals 2 as our solutions.
