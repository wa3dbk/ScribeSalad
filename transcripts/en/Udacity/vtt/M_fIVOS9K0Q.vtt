And now, finally, I would like you to actually graph this. Now, please first,

00:00:03.943 --> 00:00:07.808
just take a second, get out a piece of graph paper, create the same set of axis.

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.739
I kind of hope you already did that before on your own anyway. And then, on that

00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:15.591
set of axis, graph the points that we have on the table. After you've got that

00:00:15.603 --> 00:00:19.551
done, connect them using a ruler with a line. After you've done that, come back

00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:24.505
to this quiz on the computer and select all of the boxes on this grid where you

00:00:24.517 --> 00:00:26.580
think that these points belong.
