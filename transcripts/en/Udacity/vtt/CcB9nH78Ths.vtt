00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The scheme we look at for doing this is built on RSA,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and it uses RSA signatures as we've seen in Unit 4.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But this time, instead of using them normally,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we'll use them in a way that blinds the message from the signer.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here's the protocol--we'll assume Alice wants the bank to sign a message,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and Alice knows the bank's public key.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's an RSA key pair with the exponent and a modulus.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So m is the message Alice wants the bank to sign. Alice also picks a random value, we'll call that k.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Next, Alice will compute t by multiplying the message by k raised to the eb power.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If k is random, select it from the integers from 1 up to nB-1.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And it is also relatively prime to nB, well that would make keB mod nB

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
A permutation of the values of ZnB. That means that this is also random in that range.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And so, m multiplied by this is random. This doesn't reveal to the bank the value of m.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We can safely send that to the bank without leaking any information.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And the bank will sign that message using its private key--its private exponent dB.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
That produces the value t^dB power mod n, which the bank sends back to Alice.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
As far as the bank is concern, it just signed the random value and it sent that back to Alice.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Is there anything Alice can do with this that is useful?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The question is, which of these is equivalent to the value produced by the bank.

00:01:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Here are the choices. To answer this question, think about the properties of RSA.
