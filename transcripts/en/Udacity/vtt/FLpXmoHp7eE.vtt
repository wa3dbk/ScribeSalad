00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.440
The recall, the cases when it's truly Bush, and

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.680
we recognize it's Bush, is 123 over 127, which resolves to about .97, 97%.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.920
Where as the precision for George W.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.860
Bush, that's this column over here.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.480
In my calculations 123 over 156,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.700
which is the sum of all the predictions of George W.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.440
Bush. And that resolves to about 0.79.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.230
Much lower.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.470
Whether this warrants a recall for George W.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.700
Bush, is an open question, but you can see the asymmetry.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.130
This specific learning algorithm is really good in recalling or

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.920
finding George W.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.630
Bush, provided that it's actually Bush in the image.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.990
But it mistakes many, many other people.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.170
Most notably Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld for George W.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.670
Bush.
