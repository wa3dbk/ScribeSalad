00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's look at this equation for just the growth and constant harvesting

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and let's take care of the fact that we cannot harvest any longer once the fish become extinct.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
At which amount of fish do we find an equilibrium? All of these are given as multiples of 1 million tons.

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
0, 0.33, 0.50, 0.55, 1.0, 1.21, 1.45 and 2.0.
