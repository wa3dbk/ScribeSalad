What if we just want to print the first sentence of the book, including the

00:00:02.976 --> 00:00:06.988
period at the end? What method would you use to print just a piece of a string,

00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:13.512
not the whole thing? And at what index does the first sentence end? Here's the

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:15.943
text from Alice in Wonderland that we gave you, or at least the first couple of

00:00:15.943 --> 00:00:21.224
sentences. We could sit here and count to find exactly how many characters come

00:00:21.224 --> 00:00:28.065
before the period. Or we could use the methods we already know. Implement to

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:33.038
get first sentence method. If it's working it should return this. If you're not

00:00:33.038 --> 00:00:36.932
sure what methods to use to get started, you'll have the link to the fact

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:38.570
sheet.
