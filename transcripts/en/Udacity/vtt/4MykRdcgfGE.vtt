00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.024
I want to start by listing the factor pairs of 30. We have 1 and 30, 2 and 15, 3

00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:11.210
and 10, and 5 and 6, and we could keep listing by putting 6 and 5. But we start

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.770
to repeat a factor pair so we can stop. This lower number is positive 11. So, I

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.774
know I don't need to have a negatives for both of the factors. I just want to

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:24.956
find the factor pair that sums to 11. That factor pair, is 5 and 6. Good

00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:27.233
thinking if you found that factor pair.
