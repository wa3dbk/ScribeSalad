00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.210
Both Sass and Auto-prefixer have
existing gulp plugins that we can use.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.984
So, let's install them
as project dependencies.

00:00:05.984 --> 00:00:08.533
Execute npm install
gulp-sass in your terminal,

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.744
which will install the plugin so,
we can use it in our gulp file.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.650
Now we have to change the folder
structure slightly to account for

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.860
the generated CSS output files.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.350
Create a new folder in your project
directory and call it sass.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.027
Then move the files main.css and

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:31.580
extra.css from the CSS
folder into the sass folder.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.540
And rename the extension to .XCSS.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.750
We just turned them into Sass files
that soon got complied into CSS

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.330
files without a new task.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.880
It is now an empty CSS directory.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.900
Okay, before we can use
the gulp-sass plugin,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.870
we need to make it available to gulp.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.320
This works exactly as expected.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.870
Just required as dependency
right of the Gulp.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.910
Moving on, we create a new task and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.350
named it styles,
which is what the first argument is for.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.360
The second function as previously
is executed when a task is called.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.470
Now, we just need to tell a gulp
what files we want it to work with.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.060
For that, gulp has a special command
called source on the gulp object.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.340
The line I just added looks for

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.980
files with the .css extension in a sass
folder at any potential sub-directories.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.770
Now that we have the files,
we piped into Sass.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.940
The pipe function on the stream
of files, we just created,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.070
takes the destination that the plug
provides, so we call sass right here.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.360
The good news is that we have converted
our files from Sass to proper CSS now,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.930
the bad news is that we
haven't saved them anywhere.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.530
So finally, we use pipe again, and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.730
use the gulp.dest function to specify
our final destination, the CSS folder.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.660
This is all we have to
do to make it work.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.459
But by default,

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:43.672
the whole bit with stop and
error out when Sass discovers an error.

00:01:43.672 --> 00:01:45.780
That's not always what you want.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.250
Very often, it's better to finish and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.610
actually that you see
what error happened.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.610
Many plugins such like gulp-sass
emit events for this scenario.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.730
Listening to the error
event on a Sass object and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.120
inserting the sass log error function
here, changes the default behavior.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.670
Instead of killing the whole build, it
tells Gulp to simply log the error and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.400
go on as usual.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.470
This looks much better.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.699
Now, let's remove the CSS error and
try running Gulp in the terminal.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.670
See how the CSS files came
back into your CSS folder.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.530
These are generated from
the original Sass files.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.440
Now will be a great time to get familiar
with Sass if you haven't already.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.690
Just to give you an example, I can now
go ahead and nest my CSS to clean it up.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.880
First mission accomplished.
