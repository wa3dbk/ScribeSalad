00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.010
&gt;&gt; So like you said, our precondition for the first one,

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.640
is that both x and y are clear. We can't move x if there's anything on top of x,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.154
and we can't put it on y if something is already on top of y. Our post

00:00:12.154 --> 00:00:15.839
condition then, is that x is on y. For the table it's a little bit easier,

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.850
the table has unlimited room. So for the table, as long as X is clear we

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.720
can move X to the table. And in the postcondition is that X is now on the table.
