00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.618
The Blinn-Phong reflection model has been around for more than 30 years. It

00:00:03.618 --> 00:00:07.970
used to be hard-coded into older GPUs from the early 2000s. It's easy to

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.648
evaluate and somewhat intuitive to control. One technique worth mentioning with

00:00:11.648 --> 00:00:14.080
this reflection model is that you can get the specular highlight a different

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.930
color than the diffuse components. For example, if the specular component is

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.936
given a white color, the object looks more like a shiny plastic. If both the

00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:24.884
specular and diffused components are multiplied by the same color the material

00:00:24.884 --> 00:00:29.014
looks more metallic. However this classic reflection model is not energy

00:00:29.014 --> 00:00:32.142
balanced, you'll notice as I change the shininess, the material looks smoother,

00:00:32.142 --> 00:00:36.650
but overall the amount of light reflected becomes greater. If you think about

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.408
it, this makes a lot of sense. Here's the Blinn-Phong equation again. You take

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:44.946
N dot H, and take the maximum between that and 0, and raise that to the power

00:00:44.946 --> 00:00:49.416
of shininess. The graph of the angle between N and H, versus the specular

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:53.940
intensity, is like this. Clearly the area under the graph for cosine squared is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.884
smaller than for cosine, so the amount of energy coming from the surface will

00:00:56.884 --> 00:01:01.380
be less as you increase the shininess. Cosine cubed has even less overall

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.980
energy. As the shininess goes up, the area under the curve goes down. Two

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.080
changes give a better result, one that's both more plausible and easier to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.180
control. One idea is to attenuate the specular term by the lumbersian fall off.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.560
In other words, just like diffuse, make the specular term drop off as the angle

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.046
of the light to the surface becomes less straight. N dot L. The other idea is

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:25.280
to make these narrower curves be higher, giving them roughly the same volume at

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.618
3D. This idea is captured in the last term. As shininess increases this last

00:01:29.618 --> 00:01:32.852
term also increases, when combined with the Lambertian term this new equation

00:01:32.852 --> 00:01:37.463
gives a reasonably-balance result. Here is the original Blinnâ€“Phong equation.

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:40.403
You can see with the shininess of three it's overall much brighter than a

00:01:40.403 --> 00:01:44.382
shininess of 100. By energy-balanced I mean that changing the shininess does

00:01:44.382 --> 00:01:47.550
not noticeable change the amount of energy reflected from the surface, You can

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.976
see the effect by running the demo that follows. By the way, this demo puts all

00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:54.704
its shaders inside the JavaScript program itself, if you want to look at an

00:01:54.704 --> 00:01:59.312
example of how that's done. Using the Lambertian N dot L term also eliminates a

00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:03.339
serious problem with specular falloff. You may have noticed it yourself with

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:06.700
the basic Blinn-Phong model. Here's a view of the model with the low shininess

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.638
and the light coming up from behind it. The diffuse term drops off smoothly,

00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:14.937
but the specular suddenly drops to zero, giving a pretty bad result. By using

00:02:14.937 --> 00:02:18.199
the Lambertian dropoff, the specular term now fades properly.
