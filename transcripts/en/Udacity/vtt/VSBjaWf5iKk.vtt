00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.204
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For number one, we need to divide both sides by negative 5. 35 divided by

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:08.743
negative 5 is negative 7. And, because we're dividing by a negative number, we

00:00:08.743 --> 00:00:13.268
need to flip the sign of the inequality. So it goes from being a less than sign

00:00:13.268 --> 00:00:17.751
to a greater than sign. We can go through this similar process for the rest of

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.304
the problems. And, here are our solutions.
