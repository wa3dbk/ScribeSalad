00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.340
So if we're considering something
that looks very similar to our paper

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.140
prototype why would make one?

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.310
For this, it's important to go back
to the idea of circles of feedback.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.940
Our paper prototype was a thing that we
could show to people who were near by

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.440
and who we knew.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.200
The medium fidelity prototype will be
something we can show to subject matter

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.648
experts and users as well.

00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:24.290
By expanding our net we can gather more
information on the apps experience from

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.520
each of these vital perspectives.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.530
With an interactive prototype we
can ask users to complete tasks and

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.330
see how they go about doing it.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.270
We can ask them to explore the app
looking for a certain functionality.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.900
And most importantly we can
get out of their way and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.600
see the raw reaction to the app.
