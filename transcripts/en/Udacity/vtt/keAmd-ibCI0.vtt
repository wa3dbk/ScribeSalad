00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is 0.25, one quarter.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
To see this, recall that the variance is simply the sum of the squared differences

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
from the mean divided by n.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So in this case we have--and so this is a quarter, this is also a quarter, so this is 0.5,

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and then we divide by 2, which gives us 0.25.
