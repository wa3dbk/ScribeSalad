00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.270
There's a number of reasons
you'd be potentially better off

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.138
breaking your app into different activities.
Having a single monolithic activity

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.760
increases the complexity of your code,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.370
making the creation
and management of intent filters

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.470
much harder and making it
more difficult to maintain, test,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.740
and read your activity code.
It also increases the risk

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.443
of tightly coupling independent components
and makes it much more likely

00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:26.395
to introduce security risks
if the single activity includes

00:00:26.395 --> 00:00:29.721
both sensitive information
and information that's safe to share.

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:32.371
A good rule of thumb
is to create a new activity

00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:35.260
whenever the context changes.
For example, displaying

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.958
a different kind of data, while switching
from viewing to entering data.
