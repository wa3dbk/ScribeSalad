00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.100
In material design, we imagine UI's to
be composed of pieces of digital paper,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.930
which we call surfaces.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.220
Now these surfaces have tangible
attributes to imply real world

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.850
behaviors, but they aren't limited
like their real world equivalents.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.630
Everything on the screen lives in one
of these surfaces, including all texts,

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.370
icons, photos, buttons,
any UI element, really.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.570
Now, these surfaces have
a tiny amount of physicality,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.980
just enough to show that one
thing is distinct from another.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.150
And how they sit
relative to one another.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.430
This taps into our instinctive
ability to quickly recognize objects.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.510
There's no need to take the metaphor
too far, and use real world textures,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.900
sheens, spectral highlights, and so on.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.490
Just the smallest set of real world cues
are enough to express a lot of meaning.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.820
Surfaces also exist in 3D space,
we have varying widths and heights, and

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.910
at different elevations.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.440
These surfaces are arranged in front
of and behind one another, and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.270
cast shadows on lower surfaces.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.290
So here we can see as the fab
raises up in elevation,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.310
it casts a more diffused shadow.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.530
Let's take a small detour and
really focus in about how and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.980
why shadows get cast by surfaces.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.640
In general, objects that are closer to
us command more of our visual attention.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.610
And we can tell which objects
are closer based on their size and

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.840
how they cover and cast shadows.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.860
On the things that are behind them.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.830
So we can use depth as a queue in our UI

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.210
to direct attention to
important elements.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.480
So how do we use these
concepts on a 2D screen?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.580
We use the shadows to convey a surface's
elevation relative to other surfaces.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.750
Surfaces nearer to you
will cast a larger shadow.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.720
There's a lot of complicated maths
behind how to draw these shadows

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.680
correctly.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.150
But luckily, on Android,
we only have to edit a bit of code

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.490
to have the shadows drawn
dynamically for us.
