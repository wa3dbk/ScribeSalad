00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.673
Hello and welcome to this new lesson. In the last lesson, you've used objects

00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:10.130
of classes that other people have created. In this lesson, you will learn how

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.780
to write your own classes. We'll start out with the class that models a car

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.970
that drives along. When you design a class, the first thing you ask yourself

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.880
is. What can one do with the object? Well, imagine a car object. It can drive.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.760
Being a car, one will need to add gas once in a while. The object should be

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.640
able to tell us how many miles it has driven and also how much gas is left.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.970
That's all that our car objects will be able to do. Now the first step is to

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.010
take this English description of the car's capabilities and turn it into the

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.720
Java code for the public interface. Her is how I like to do it. I first imagine

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.800
myself being a user of this class, so I have an object, here it's my car and

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.805
here's how I might want to call the add gas method. The name of the method,

00:00:55.805 --> 00:01:00.152
addGas and here I'd add 20 gallons. To make the car drive, call the drive

00:01:00.152 --> 00:01:04.959
method on the car and of course one has to say for how long to drive and here

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:09.080
we say 100 miles. And then I might want to find out how much gas is left in the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.950
tank after that. So I again use the mycar object, invoke the getgasintank

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.490
method. It returns the gas level and I store that in a variable. Well, what's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.380
the point? I now have more information. I can see that these two methods take

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.010
arguments and this one doesn't. And I can see that this method here returns a

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.020
value that's actually a number and these two don't. Now it's fairly easy to

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.330
write up the publivc interface of the class. I have four methods. Here you see

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.920
their names. You see that the first two methods have parameter variables and

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.340
you see that these two methods return values. Let's see more closely on how

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.380
this process works. Look at the add gas method here. Here, we see it takes an

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.609
argument, the number of gallons added. I've called that here the amount and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:04.497
it's of type double. This method doesn't return any value, so it's declared as

00:02:04.497 --> 00:02:09.810
a void. In contrast gas getgasintank has no argument. So there's no parameter

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.052
variable here but it returns a number. So we put the keyword double here. So

00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:20.428
the general process when designing a class is to first informally figure out

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:24.440
what you want the class to do. Then to put yourselves in the shoe of the user

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.950
of the class and see how those methods might be called. And then you have

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.620
enough information to write up the public interface in Java. Sara's going to

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.066
practice that process with you with another class.
