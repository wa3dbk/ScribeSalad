00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.775
So far, all the Exceptions we've seen were produced by built-in Python code. But

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:08.557
you can raise Exceptions yourself. And the way to do this is to use raise

00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:13.262
followed by any Python Expression. As long as that Python Expression evaluates

00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:17.720
to some instance of Exception, this will raise the Exception that you intended.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.954
If it doesn't evaluate to an instance of Exception, well, that's probably a bug

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:23.193
in your code. It'll raise some other Exception.
