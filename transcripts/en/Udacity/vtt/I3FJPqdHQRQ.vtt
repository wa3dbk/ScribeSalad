00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.690
Note, to make matters slightly more confusing,

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.800
JavaScript allows you to assign to variables you've never even declared before.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.370
In this example I took the var statement off of this assignment operation.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.710
So foil has not been declared anywhere in our whole program.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.060
When you do this kind of assignment, variables that you're assigning to for

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.910
the first time will be added automatically to the global scope, and

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.930
not to whatever scope you did the assignment in.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.580
This is actually a pretty bad practice because leaving the var keyword off

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.689
is more often done by accident than on purpose.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.770
Even if you do purposefully decide that you want to do this,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.350
it'll be very confusing for other people reading your code and

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.950
they'll probably assume you just made a mistake.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.970
Also note, that unlike a lot of other languages,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.850
not all curly braces in Java Script are relevant for scoping.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.600
Blocks on if statements or while statements and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.650
other looping constructs like that, do not create new scopes.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.040
Only the curly braces that you find on a function statement creates a scope.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.650
Scoping limitations are actually very useful.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.870
They allow us to think about less of our program all at once.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.510
So we don't want to subvert them by leaving off var declarations.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.480
So for now, just remember to declare every variable with a var

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.420
keyword in whichever lexical scope you want that variable to live.
