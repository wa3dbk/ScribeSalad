00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In the previous example, I had highlighted ironcrutchli and x in red.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
They were identifiers, which is a formal way of saying

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
variable name or function name.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Identifiers are textual string descriptions that refer to program elements.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Things like factorial, s and tmp are all identifiers.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We often call them identifiers because they identify a particular value

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or storage location.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We're going to allow our identifiers to start with lowercase letters

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or also uppercase letters, and they can finish out

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
with any number of upper or lowercase letters.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Here we have another uppercase letter as time goes by,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and sometimes people like to use underscores to add readability.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That's totally allowed in the identifier, but we'll say not at the beginning.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You have to start with a letter, but after that you can have underscores.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Here I've shown 6 examples of identifiers,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and I would like you to use the interpreter

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to write an identifier token rule for these sorts of JavaScript identifiers.

00:01:10.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Try it out using the interpreter.
