00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So welcome back!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You just made it to one of the hairy parts of this class when we talk about normal distributions.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now we've come back into something intuitive, which is how to manipulate normal distributions.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Like I said in the previous class, you can flip coins up to better to the values

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
from the normal distribution just the same way you flip coins.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So now I'd like to understand what happens if I manipulate normal distributions.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So my very first example will be the following.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Suppose all the salaries in my company Udacity are normally distributed.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That is to say, If I were to look at the salaries, there is a well-defined mean of course.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Fewer and fewer people deviate from the mean by a larger amount where the frequency of deviations

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
captured really well by this normal distributions as most people are really near the mean

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and there's a small number of people are farther from mean.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And just for the sake of the argument, suppose the mean is $60,000 per year

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and the standard deviation is 10,000--these are obviously not accurate numbers.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Suppose now, I give everyone a raise of say $10,000, what do think is the new mean

00:01:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and the new standard deviation following µ' and σ'--can you answer these questions?
