Better yet, we can chain together all the matrices that effect an object and

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:08.534
store what 3JS calls a world matrix. Say we have a hubcap that's part of a

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:12.576
wheel, that's part of a car. Each of these objects has its own concatinated

00:00:12.576 --> 00:00:17.053
matrix of transforms. If a program wants to display the hubcap on the screen, we

00:00:17.053 --> 00:00:21.688
need to multiply the hubcap's vertices by these three matrices in turn. Instead

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:25.976
of doing three matrix multiplies, we can concatenate the three matrices to form

00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:30.154
a single world matrix and store that separately for the hubcap. This matrix is

00:00:30.154 --> 00:00:34.290
the world matrix, or it's sometimes called the model matrix. Whatever you call

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.322
it, a single matrix multiply is then all that is needed to transform a vertex

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:40.813
from its model space to world space directly.
