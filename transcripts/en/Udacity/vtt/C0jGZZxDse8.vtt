00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.140
So now that we know that each
application saves a lot of memory.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.890
And there is much less physical
memory than all the applications

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.720
actually can access.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.110
The question is where
is the missing memory?

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.060
So let's say we have one
application with four pages.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.680
Another application with
let's say four pages.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.190
A physical memory with let's
say four physical frames.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.060
Let's say that each of these
applications is actually using all of

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.190
its pages.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.970
Because there are only four.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.610
In this application there
is a four entry page table.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.620
That for every page tells us
which frame contains it and

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.360
it could be any frame in memory.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.920
This application also has some of
its pages in physical memory but

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.010
obviously there is not enough physical
memory for all of these pages.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.470
So the question is where
are the rest of them.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.030
And the answer is,
they're on the hard disk.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.535
So some of these pages
are not actually in memory,

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:05.280
they're actually stored on
the hard drive in the system.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.340
These pages can not be directly accessed
by the processor because the processor

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.080
can only really access through loads and
stores in the physical memory.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.660
So if the processor ever tries to access
one of these they need to be brought

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.910
from the disk before
they can be accessed.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.690
We will shortly see how that works,
but for

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.740
now just remember that because the
virtual memory of all the applications

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.790
can significantly exceed the size of the
physical memory, some of the memory that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.510
the applications think they have is on
the disk, not really in memory at all.
