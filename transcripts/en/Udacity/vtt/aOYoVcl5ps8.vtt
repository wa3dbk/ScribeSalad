Okay, let's look more closely at the meaning of an exponent. It's easy to think

00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:08.644
of 2 to the 3 as 6, but we really know this isn't true. I know exponents

00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:13.301
represent repeated multiplication, so I should have 2 times 2 times 2, which is

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:17.727
8. This is often a common error that students make throughout Algebra. You have

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:22.203
to train your eye, and train your mind to think about what this really means. Go

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:26.521
slow, and be careful. This is how you can get better at Math, taking your time

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.795
and asking yourself, what does this mean?
