00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.768
The Intermediate Value Theorem gives us some really fundamental information

00:00:03.768 --> 00:00:07.960
then, about how to find zeros in curves without breaks in them. We just need to

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.315
look for regions of the graph where y values switch from being positive to

00:00:11.315 --> 00:00:16.300
being negative, or from being negative to being positive. In either case, the

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.450
curve must have at least one x intercept somewhere in that region that we're

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.648
looking at. This is pretty general information, though. And the intermediate

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:27.990
value theorem can actually help us even more. In fact, Athena used it on the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.276
train in a very clever way. One day, Athena needed to catch the train in

00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:36.688
Mountain View. She had been visiting the Udacity office for the afternoon. Now,

00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:40.322
to find out what time her train would leave, she called her brother, Nicos. All

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:43.562
he could tell her was that the train would come to Mountain View sometime

00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:48.490
between 4pm and 6pm. This information wasn't quite accurate enough for Athena.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.716
She wanted to be able to plan her afternoon a bit more precisely. So she looked

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:55.420
up the schedule for the train. Much to Athena's disappointment, somehow, the

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.300
one departure time that was missing from the train schedule was the time that

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.617
the train would leave Mountain View. We have the times for every other stop

00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:05.972
listed, and the stops are written in order here, just like we saw on the map

00:01:05.972 --> 00:01:11.310
earlier. Staring in San Jose and then moving north along the track. Based on

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.885
this schedule, Athena knows a window of time within which the train will leave

00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:18.100
from Mountain View. What is that window?
