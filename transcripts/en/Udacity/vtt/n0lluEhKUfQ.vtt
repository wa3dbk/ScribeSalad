00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.430
We've got our new variable your joined so let's look

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.320
at its summary it looks like most of our users

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.230
joined in 2012 or 2013 and since the values for

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.490
this variable are discreet and the range is pretty narrow I'm

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.570
going to go ahead and table this variable as well.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.580
Here we can see the distributions of users and each year

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.920
joined. Notice that there isn't much data here about early

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.970
joiners. To increase the data we have in each tenure category,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.450
we can group some of these years together. The

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.259
cut function is often quite useful for making discrete variables

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.670
from continuous or numerical ones, sometimes in combination with the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.290
function quantile. Now what I want you to do is

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.710
to look at the documentation for cut, and refer

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.650
to the link in the instructor notes to complete this

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.680
next programming exercise. Your task is to cut the variable

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.720
year joined to create four bins, or buckets of users.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.130
The bins will be from 2004 to 2009, 2009

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.551
to 2011, 2011 to 2012, and then 2012 to 2014.
