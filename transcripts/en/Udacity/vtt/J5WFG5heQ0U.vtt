00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.670
You started down a new path
in the world of programming.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.130
And you've probably faced
some bumps in the road.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.900
But just stop and
realize that you're still here.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.700
You haven't given up.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.680
So now's your chance to evaluate
where you want to go next.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.540
In this course, we're going to show
you four different paths you can take.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.800
You'll learn more about front end
programming, and back end programming.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.030
As well as mobile programming,
and data analysis.
