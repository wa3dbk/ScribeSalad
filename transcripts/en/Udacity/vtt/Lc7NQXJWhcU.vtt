Initially, when first learning of their limited time, people often deny it

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:08.916
thinking no doc, you must have had the wrong chart. Next, people often get

00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:14.152
angry and feel upset, that why is this happening to me? This isn't fair. That's

00:00:14.152 --> 00:00:18.560
followed by bargaining, which involves negotiating with God for more time.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.534
Please, if you just let me live, I promise, blank. When it finally hits that

00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:27.098
this really is the end, people often feel depressed and a sense of hopelessness

00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:34.550
prevails. Next, death and all that it means can be accepted and even embraced.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.529
People are at peace with their impending exit from this earth.
