00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.481
The answer is the worst possible, 200.

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:05.410
Let's see how this might happen.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.109
We might start by
finding this path here.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.430
And since the capacity of
this middle edge is 1,

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.860
and that's the lowest,
that's all the flow that we can push.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.360
This then becomes my new flow.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.640
We might then find this
augmenting path here.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.170
Adding that in, gives this total flow.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.620
Two iterations for two units of flow.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.290
And we can continue in this pattern
all the way until the maximum flow

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.190
of 200 is achieved.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.950
This means that the bound we had
before on Ford-Fulkerson is tight.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.280
It can take as many iterations as there
are units of flow and the maximum flow.
