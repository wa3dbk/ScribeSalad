00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.930
Let's get some practice with nested loops. This digital clock can display any

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.232
time of day. It's an American clock, so the hours go from 1 to 12 and minutes

00:00:11.232 --> 00:00:16.480
go from 00 to 59. We can use a nested loop to print this table of all of the

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.978
possible times the digital clock can display. We'll need two loops. One will

00:00:21.978 --> 00:00:26.870
count up the hours, and one will count up the minutes. To make sure that

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.070
minutes are printed with a zero before them so they fill up two digits, you can

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.032
use the format string %02d. And if you're not sure where to start while writing

00:00:35.032 --> 00:00:41.030
your code, think about what code you would write just to print the first line.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.287
And how that differs from the code that you would write to print the second

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:44.040
line.
