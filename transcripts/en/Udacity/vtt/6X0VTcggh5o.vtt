People with learning disabilities, need to be assessed differently, because IQ

00:00:03.288 --> 00:00:07.979
doesn't really work for them. In fact, we have that. It's called the Adaptive

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.873
Skills Test, and what the Adaptive Skills Test is all about, is assessing every

00:00:11.873 --> 00:00:17.407
day functioning. So how well you understand what people are saying can you feed

00:00:17.407 --> 00:00:23.802
yourself, can you dress yourself. And things like that. So, adaptive skills

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:28.666
tests are better ways of assessing intellectual functioning in people with

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:32.152
disabilities than IQ tests are.
