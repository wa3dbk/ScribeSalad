00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.930
Once an app is verified to
be from an approved source,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.200
iOS enforces security measures,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.790
designed to prevent it from compromising
other apps, or the rest of the system.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.420
All third party apps are sandboxed,
so that they are restricted from

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.210
accessing files stored by other apps,
or from making changes to the device.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.570
This prevents apps from gathering or

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.050
modifying information
stored by other apps.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.800
Each app has a unique home directory for

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.356
its files, which is randomly
assigned when the app is installed.

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:40.670
If a third-party app, needs to access
information other than its own,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.130
it does so only by using services
explicitly provided by our iOS.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.740
System files and resources are also
excluded from user's apps.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.390
The majority of iOS,
as well as the third party apps,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.510
run as a non-privileged user mobile.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.990
The entire iOS petition
is mounted as read only.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.760
Unnecessary tools,
such as remote locking services,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.340
are not included in the system software.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.900
The iOS APIs, do not allow apps
to escalate their own privileges

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.050
to modify the apps or iOS itself.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.280
To summarize,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.250
by sandboxing a third party app,
each app has its unique directory, and

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.260
can access its own files, any access
to other files will be restricted.
