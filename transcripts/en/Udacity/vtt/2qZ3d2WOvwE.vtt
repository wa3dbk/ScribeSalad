00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.939
We will now dive into some of the specifics of how D3 works, and

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.900
why it is becoming the go to tool for anyone who wants to visualize data.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.180
Rather than obscure and hide the Document Object Model,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.090
D3 embraces it by directly manipulating HTML modes and

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.760
SVG objects, Through common conventions like CSS selectors.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.930
By doing so, D3 has enabled much more expressive visualizations and

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.350
allows designers to directly interact with developers,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.140
by separating the style of a visualization from the mechanics of it.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.540
D3 visualizations, Since they operate directly on HTML through the DOM and SVG,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.600
can be styled in the exact same way as any other web page, such as with CSS.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.650
And D3 code can actually manipulate already created and HTML documents.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.040
We will see an example of this when we get to the live code portion of

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.660
this lesson and actually manipulate this very web page and

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.110
change some of the stylings and elements.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.200
One example of leveraging this power might be to pre-render HTML and SVG objects

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.440
for a complex visualization on the server side, and then simply use JavaScript

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.880
for any sort of interaction or dynamics that we need on the client side.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.500
If you have the libraries built on top of D3, actually do exactly this and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.180
allow you to render on the server side D3 objects to static images or JSON.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.840
The last benefit I will mention, though there are quite a few more, is that,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.330
since D3 visualizations operate on the DOM and HTML directly, they can leverage

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.030
all the improvements and advances of the open web, such as browser enhancements,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.170
JavaScript speed increases, and newer standards, such as HTML5.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.650
And also, developers can use all of their familiar tools to work with D3.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.460
Such as debuggers, text editors, existing libraries.
