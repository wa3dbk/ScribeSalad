00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.795
Now this is something we're familiar with again, it's just a rational

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:08.444
expression. We don't have any fractions in the numerator and denominator. We

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:12.669
just have a polynomial here and a polynomial here. So use your knowledge of

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:17.256
simplifying rational expressions to figure out the simplified form. What do you

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:19.353
think is our final answer?
