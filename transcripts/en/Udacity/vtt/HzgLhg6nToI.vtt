00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.476
let's do 3 more examples.

00:00:01.476 --> 00:00:06.754
In this example we're switching on the threadIdx.x % 2

00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:13.222
and we're launching a single thread block with 1024 threads, 1-dimensional.

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:19.649
In this example we're switching on threadIdx.x/32, integer divide.

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:22.693
Otherwise the same, 1024 threads, 1-dimensional.

00:00:22.693 --> 00:00:25.769
And finally, we'll switch on threadIdx.x /8.

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.878
Now cases range from 0 to 63

00:00:27.878 --> 00:00:32.680
and again we're going to launch 1024 threads single, 1-dimensional block.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.216
So what is the slowdown for these 3 situations?
