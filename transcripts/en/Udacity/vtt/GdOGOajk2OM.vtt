Okay.

00:00:00.407 --> 00:00:05.236
For this third problem, I have the negative of the absolute value of 3 cubed, or

00:00:05.248 --> 00:00:10.428
3 to the 3rd, minus the quantity 4 times 6 minus 5 squared. And this quantity is

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.426
cubed or raised to the 3rd power. Remember, start with the inside parenthesis

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:20.016
first, and then work your way out. You can put your answer in this box here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Good luck.
