00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.250
So we have seen what a single
bit in memory looks like.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.120
Now let's see how the whole
chip is organized.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.730
We said already that we have these
word lines that activate cells.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.150
We have a number of word lines, and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.210
the thing that decides which word line
gets activated is called a row decoder.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.340
What we give to the row decoder is
some bits of the address that tallied

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.260
which of the word lines to activate.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.270
It can only activate one
word line at a time.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.442
So this is a real decoder.

00:00:32.442 --> 00:00:34.280
You give it a number.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.070
It activates a line that
corresponds to that number.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
In memory, we call this row address.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.900
There is also a bit line here, and
if you remember, a memory cell

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.290
exists at every intersection between
this bit line and a word line.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.140
So what a word line does
is it connects this cell,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.630
this cell, this cell, or
this cell to the bit line.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.100
So by supplying, let's say,
two bits of the address,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.670
which was which of the four bits would
be outputting on this one bit line.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.640
Of course,
there are more bit lines than just one.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.670
And this, for example,
is a 16 bit memory.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.920
It's a four-by-four bit memory.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.060
Four bits can output to
the same bit line, and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.290
there are four bits activated
by each of the word lines, so

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.340
when we select the row,
four bits get output out of here.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.740
Now bit lines are very long.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.850
And as we said, the cell is either
a relatively weak SRAM cell, so

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.298
it will slowly pull the bit line one way
or the other, or it is a DRAM cell that

00:01:44.298 --> 00:01:49.740
discharges a relatively small capacitor
into this relatively long bit line.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.580
If we discharge a small
capacitor into a long bit line,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.030
the voltage on the bit line will change,
but it will change relatively little.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.230
It will not change all the way to
the level that corresponds to a one or

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.960
to a zero.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.860
If we have a weak cell,
we don't want to wait for

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.669
that cell to raise the whole
bit line one way or the other.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:17.020
This is why the bit lines are connected
to a device called sense amplifier.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.180
What it does is it senses the small
changes on the bit line and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.030
amplifies them.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.050
So it's really helping the cell raise or
lower the voltage on the bit line.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.335
And it has relatively
powerful circuitry for

00:02:33.335 --> 00:02:38.515
each bit line, so it's significantly
bigger than a single row of cells,

00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:40.845
but you only need one of these
at the end of the bit line.

00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:42.985
You don't need one of
these at every cell.

00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:46.495
So you have relatively small and
weak cells, and you have this

00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:50.540
beefy thing here that is helping
them raise or lower the bit line.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.240
The signals that are produced by
the sense amplifier, which are now

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.420
correctly one or zero bits, go to
a storage element called row buffer.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.980
The row buffer stores
the correct values that we read

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.910
from the whole row of cells.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.440
So in this case, the row buffer will
contain four bits because that's how

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.390
many bits are there in the row.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.430
The row buffer feeds the data it latched

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.690
to another decoder that is
called a column decoder.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.690
This decoder selects the correct
bit among these four,

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.410
let's say, using the column address,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.650
which is another part of the data
address, and it outputs a single bit.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.680
If we want to build something that has
more than just one bit of data for

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.500
each location, we will replicate this.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.250
So we will have, let's say,
two of these, give them the same row and

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.802
column address, and
now they output a two bit value.
