00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.540
Hi.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.510
I'm back again.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.260
Just wanted to stress the importance
of the material you're about to learn.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.740
Using a data structure that
employs a hash function,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.870
allows you to do look-ups
in constant time.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.910
Let that sink in for a second.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.140
With everything you've learned so far,
you need to do look-ups in linear time.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.810
In a list or a set,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.529
you need to look through every element
to find the one you're looking for.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.990
Stacks and cues let you look up the
oldest, or newest elements, immediately.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.310
And priority queues will let you find
the highest priority element quickly,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.850
but if you want any other element,
you've got to do a linear time search.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.880
The ability to do
constant time look-ups,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.230
will make almost any algorithm
you write, instantly faster.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.610
Everyone here at Udacity
was really excited,

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.630
that you'd be learning such
a crucial topic today.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.310
They all wanted to be
here to talk about it.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.680
But they couldn't all
abandon their work, so

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.170
they decided to send a representative,
whoever was the most excited.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.890
Let's see who they sent.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.360
Starbucks says that this concept shows
up constantly in technical interviews.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.830
You can almost always optimize an
answer, or improve an answer with it, or

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.746
reduce a complex question,
to just use a hash function.

00:01:15.746 --> 00:01:18.729
Also, he saw a squirrel this morning.
