00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510
The answer to that is we are not yet able to say if the problems that Alice and Bob

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:12.430
are working on are tractable or intractable, and the reason for that is that we have only considered

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.480
one single algorithm, but for a problem to be truly intractable, we would have to show that

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.660
no matter what kind of algorithm we come up with, so if we don't use the simple algorithm

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.810
like Alice and Bob were using but something more complicated, we would have to show that

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.760
nevertheless, this algorithm still runs an exponential running time.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.990
Just by stating that there' s one algorithm for a problem that has exponential running time

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.780
does not necessarily mean that the problem itself is hard; it could also mean that we just

00:00:40.780 --> 99:59:59.000
haven't felt long enough about designing an appropriate algorithm for that problem.
