00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.890
Hi, my name is Sebastian.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.900
I'm actually an entrepreneur,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.070
and I'm super excited about
the Tech Entrepreneurship Manage Degree

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.590
because it teaches you how
to become an entrepreneur.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.410
Now what's great about an entrepreneur,
entrepreneurs change the world.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.500
They dream, they reach for
the stars and then they make it happen.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.990
They understand how to
get the world to change,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.980
how to make the world a better place.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.870
And being an entrepreneur
means you can do it yourself,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.260
you have no boss just do it and
every mistake is your own mistake.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.130
Now I haven't always
been an entrepreneur.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.716
I used to be at Stanford teaching
as a computer science professor.

00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:36.796
I actually had tenure which
is a lifetime position, so

00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:39.830
it was very comfortable at
a fantastic university.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.280
And at some point I got a little bored
by all the security that I had and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.310
figured I've gotta do
something bigger than that.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.090
And then moved over to a search
engine company called Google.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.710
And I started Google X,
self driving cars, Google Glass,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.540
Project Loon, a whole bunch of projects.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.550
And these are all crazy projects
that I could do at Google.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.140
But in Udacity,
this is my biggest moonshot so

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.480
far, so
really trying to change the world.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.334
Now I'm not here to tell
you about my company,

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:07.320
I'm here to tell you,
make your own company.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.750
You can duplicate this.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.100
If you take this Tech Entrepreneurship
Manage Degree, you learn the nuts and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.870
bolts, how to be successful.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.660
And your going to work many many
mistakes that I have to make because

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.500
none of this exist when I started.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.810
The great thing about this not
a degree is that you're going to build

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.870
your own stuff.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.482
You basically believe your own mini
company as part of your training which

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:29.480
is you're going to build
the first version of your product.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.620
You develop a monetization strategy,
you get your first users

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.260
of customers on board and we even teach
you how to pitch to potential investors.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.934
All the stuff we do in real life,

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.614
now in your
Tech Entrepreneurship Manage Degree.

00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:46.550
So welcome to another degree and
I see you in class.
