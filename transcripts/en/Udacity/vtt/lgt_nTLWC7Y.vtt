00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.490
Before leaving RIM and moving on to
some of the things it is used for,

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.400
it's important to emphasize, again,
that the goal is interoperability.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.900
And in support of that, RIM can be
used both for HL7 V3 messages, and for

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.340
clinical documents constructed at least
in part from the data in those messages.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.840
This was a key goal of the effort.
