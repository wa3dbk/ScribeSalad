00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.999
Now we can calculate the standard error. Note that since S sub G is the

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:10.225
standard deviation, if we square it, we have the variance. So we have the

00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:14.385
variance of the meal prices at Gettysburg divided by the number in our sample

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:18.545
from Gettysburg, plus the variance of our meal prices at Wilma divided by the

00:00:18.545 --> 00:00:23.870
number of restaurants in our sample from Wilma.
