00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.472
This could come in handy with something like a temperature conversion. This

00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:08.412
equation relates degree Celsius to Fahrenheit. So if I told you that the

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:13.638
temperature was 32 degrees in Fahrenheit, then you could quickly plug that in to

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:19.027
tell me that the Celsius would be, well, 0 since 32 minus 32 would equal 0. But

00:00:19.027 --> 00:00:23.692
what if I told you the temperature was 32 degrees Celsius. Would you be able to

00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:27.405
tell me the degrees Fahrenheit? You could plug in 32 into C and then use your

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:31.500
equation solving skills to figure this out but I wouldn't want to do this work

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.338
every single time for a new degree Celsius. I want an equation that just has F

00:00:36.338 --> 00:00:40.736
solve for. So let's figure that out together. I want you to use your knowledge

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:45.656
of solving equations to solve for F here. Type your final answer in this box.

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:50.693
Remember, the equation here should contain the variables C and F. And since

00:00:50.693 --> 00:00:55.150
you're solving for F, your equation should start with F equals. Good luck on

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.023
this one.
