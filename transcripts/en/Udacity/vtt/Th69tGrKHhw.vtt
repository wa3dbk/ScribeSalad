00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Now the halting problem isn't the undecidable problem.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.330
There's actually a very large number of undecidable problems as we'll soon see.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.460
And the technique here is almost the same that we use for showing np-completeness.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.200
So if you remember that once we had shown SAT to be np-complete.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.110
We could take a whole bunch of other problems such as vertex cover, clique, and independent set

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.940
and of course many more and show these to be np-complete using a reduction

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.630
because we were able to show that if you could solve vertex cover in polynomial time

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.850
then you could also solve SAT in polynomial time and we'll now use a very similar technique.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.140
Now we know the halting problem is undecidable, we can look at other problems

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.300
and show through a kind of reduction that if we could solve these problems here

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.930
then we would be able to solve the halting problem, which of course is not possible.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.460
Now, the first problem we might be looking at is a generalized version of the halting problem.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.220
As you remember, the halting problem takes as input a program

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.030
and an input on which to run that program and what we could now ask

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.340
is of course a more general question and that is, does the program have any input

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.760
on which it stops or does it always go into an infinite loop?

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.470
And we'll call that the generalized halting problem.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.910
So we're given P and now the question is, is there any input I for which P halts?

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.220
And I'll show you now that this problem here is also undecidable

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.860
and then we'll look at other problems and you can show that they are undecidable.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.030
So the proof always work in a very similar fashion. You again start out with an assumption.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.370
And then lead that assumption into a contradiction.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.450
The initial assumption is that we had an algorithm or a program

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.340
that can decide the generalized halting problem.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.970
So assume there's a program P' that solves this problem here.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.220
Now, how could we use this program here to solve the halting problem?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.940
Well, that's actually quite easy. So we have the program and the input.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.420
And now we construct a new program from that. That problem is actually quite easy.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.160
We just make the input here part of the program code so in kind of a pseudocode writing here

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.830
the first line of that program P'' would be set the input variables to I

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.780
and that is now part of the program code of this program here.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.000
Here it was a separate input and now it's part of the program code.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.250
So we set the input variables to the input and then run P as always.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.490
And now it's clear that if we have a problem that solves the generalized halting problem

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.770
then we can just feed it to this program here because this program here

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.010
actually ignores any input that we give to it.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.930
Finding out if that program over here will ever terminate is the same as asking

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.780
if the original program P will terminate on the input I.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.960
This program here cannot exist because if the generalized halting problem were decidable

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.690
this would also mean that the special halting problem here

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.990
where we are given an explicit input would also be decidable.

00:02:43.990 --> 99:59:59.000
So we know that this problem is now undecidable as well.
