00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.330
There are several types of
cryptographic algorithms.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.300
The first is secret key cryptography.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.190
Here, the same key is used for
encryption and decryption.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.270
In other words, the sender and

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.110
the receiver of the confidential
message, must use the same key.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.790
Another type of algorithm
is public key cryptography.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.790
Here, there are two key
components that are paired or

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.130
linked together mathematically.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.120
The public component is used for
encryption.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.229
And a private component is used for
decryption.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:37.130
For example, Alice can use Bob's
public key to encrypt a message,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.020
that only Bob can decrypt.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.640
Because only Bob has
the corresponding private key that

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.660
will decrypt the message properly.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.610
The private key component is
also used for signing a message.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.835
And then, the public key component
can be used to verify the signature.

00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:57.265
For example, Alice can send
a message using her private key, and

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:00.995
anyone knowing her public
key can verify that.

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:04.334
Only Alice can produce
this proper signature.
