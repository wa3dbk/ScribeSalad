Fortunately, there's a better way. We can make in, make use of

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.250
an already defined mathematical construct called a permutation, that is,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.990
we can describe the same elements as in English by the following. X has the same

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.230
elements as Y if the elements of X are a permutation of the elements of Y. Or,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.350
the other way around. The elements of Y are permutations of the elements of X.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.630
Because we know that permutation is well-defined, has well-defined mathematical

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.070
properties, we don't have to write it out for ourselves. We could just rely on

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.950
an already existing well-defined concept. Nevertheless, for

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.680
the, for the purposes of this exercise, let's, let's build up a a specification

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.170
of what it, what it means for one vector to be a permutation of another vector.
