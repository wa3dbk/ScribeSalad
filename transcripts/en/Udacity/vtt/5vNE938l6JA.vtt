00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now let's go back and analyze this maximize differential strategy

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
versus the maximizing probability of winning strategy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The question is, how do these 2 compare?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
When are they different, and when are they the same?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you're trying to impress the scouts, you're not going to be making some crazy moves,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so probably most of the time, you'd expect the 2 strategies to agree,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but some of the time, maybe 1 of them is going to be more aggressive

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or taking more chances than the other.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's see if we can analyze that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So I start off by defining a bunch of states, and I'm just going to look

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
from 1 player's point of view.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It doesn't really matter to have both since it's symmetric,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so for all these values of me, you, and pending, collect all those states.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It turns out that there's 35,000 of them.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Then I define a variable r to be a default dictionary, which counts up integers,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
so it starts at 0, and then I go through all the states,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and I increment the count for a result for the tuple of the action that's taken by

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
max_wins and the action that's taken by max_diffs.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I want to count up.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This is going to be hold, hold, roll, roll. etc.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I want to see how many of each do we have,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and let's convert r back to standard dict, and there we have it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So most of the time, 29,700 out of the 35,000--both strategies agree that roll

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is the right thing to do.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Then another 1200 times, both strategies agree that hold is the right thing to do.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But in 2 cases, they differ.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So sometimes, max_wins says hold and max_diffs says roll.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That happened 381 times, but 10 times more often, it's max_wins that says roll

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and max_diff that says hold.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That actually surprised me.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So it's the max_wins strategy that's really more aggressive.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It's rolling more often.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I thought it was going to be the max_diffs strategy.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I thought that was going to be more aggressive, right?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So that's the one that's trying to impress the scouts.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I thought it was going to be rolling trying to rack up a really big score.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But no! So the data tells a different story.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It's not trying to rack up a really big score.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So what's going on?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Well, first it might be nice just to quantify how different they are

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
since I kind of asked that question.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So there's 35, 301 states all together and they differ on 3975 + 381,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and that's 12% of the states that they differ on.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So what's the story?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Where do those 12% of the states come from?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We still don't know, and we don't even quite know what questions to ask,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
but it's here that some of our design choices start to pay off.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So remember we always start our design with an inventory of concepts,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and we have things like the dice and the score,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and then we got into things like the utility function and the quality function,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
so we built all these up, and yes, we're building from the ground up,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and yes, at the top, we have a play_pig function, and we can still call that function,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
but at the bottom, we have all these useful tools.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So now when we're not just about playing pig, now we're trying to analyze the situation

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
to understand this story of why are these 2 different?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Well, play_pig by itself--the top level function we define--that's not going to help us,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
but all these little tools that we built down here, they will be helpful.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We can start to put them together and explore.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So we built this tower, and the tower built up to define the play pig function,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and in some languages, it's all about building the tower.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
When you're done, that's all you have.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
But in Python, it's common and in many languages, it's a good design and strategy

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to say let's just build up components along the way so that we--yes, we have the tower,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
but we can also go out in other directions.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
If we're interested--not just in playing pig--but we're interested in figuring out this story,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
then we can quickly assemble pieces from down here

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and build something that can address that.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So I've got all the pieces available. It makes it easy to explore.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
But I still need an idea, and here's my idea.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I expected maximize differential to be aggressive, to try to rack up the big points,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and I found out that it was actually maximizing the probability of winning

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that was more aggressive that rolled more often.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Why could that be? I think I might know the answer.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I think it might be that the maximized differential is more willing to lose

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
rather than more excited about winning by a lot.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
What do I mean by that?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Well, if you're maximizing the probability of winning,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
you don't care if you lose by 1 or if you lose by 40,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
it's all a loss.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The maximized differential--if he's losing by a fair amount, he might say,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
well--say he's behind 39-0 in a game to 40,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and say he's accumulated 30 points,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
If he's trying to maximize the probability of winning,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
he would keep on rolling.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
He says, well, I don't have that good of a chance of winning,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
but all that counts is winning.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
If I stop now, the opponent's going to win on the next move,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
so I've got to keep rolling.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Probably I'll pig out and only get 1 point, but it's worth it for that small chance of winning.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
That's what the maximize win probability strategy would do.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
The maximize differential strategy would say, hey, if I can get 30 points rather than 1,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that cuts the differential way down, so that's worth doing.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I'll sacrifice winning in order to maximize the differential.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Now that's a suggestion of a story, but I don't know yet.

00:05:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Is that the right story? Let's find out.
