00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.280
There are three mechanisms in SPIN to create protection

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.460
domains, and use them. The first one is, of course, the create

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.900
call that allows creating a logical protection domain. And

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.850
this mechanism in SPIN allows initiating an object

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.770
file with the contents and export the names that are contained as

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.320
entry point methods inside the object to be visible outside. That's what this

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.240
create call, supported by SPIN, provides to a service creator. For example, if

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.150
I'm creating a memory management service. I can write the entry point functions

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.260
in my memory management service and export the names using this create mechanism

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.680
that's available in SPIN. The second mechanism in SPIN is resolving names.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.229
If one protection domain wants to use the names that is there in another

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.710
protection domain. The way we can accomplish that is by using this resolve

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.360
primitive that's available in SPIN. Resolve is

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.200
very similar to linking two separately compiled

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.160
files together that a compiler does routinely.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.060
So, you may be very familiar with the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.686
compilation process where you may separately compile

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:30.300
files and once you have done the separate

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.230
compilation of the files, then you go through a link phase of the compiler where

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.180
the linker resolves the names that are being

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.270
used by one object file with the names

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.211
that are defined in another object file. That's

00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:47.912
the same thing that the resolve mechanism of

00:01:47.912 --> 00:01:52.584
SPIN does is, it resolves the names that are being used in source, which is a

00:01:52.584 --> 00:01:55.942
logical protection domain, and the target, which is

00:01:55.942 --> 00:01:59.499
another logical protection domain. As the result of

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:03.713
this resolve step, the source logical protection domain

00:02:03.713 --> 00:02:07.927
and the target logical prediction domain are dynamically

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:10.947
linked or bound together. And once bound

00:02:10.947 --> 00:02:14.645
together, accessing methods that are inside this

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:18.515
target protection domain happens at memory speeds,

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:20.665
meaning it is as efficient as a

00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:23.847
procedure call, once this resolve step has

00:02:23.847 --> 00:02:26.748
happened. As I mention before, to reduce

00:02:26.748 --> 00:02:30.320
the proliferation of small logical protection domains

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.056
you may want to combine protection domains

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:36.172
to create an aggregate larger protection domain

00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:38.756
and SPIN provides a mechanism for that,

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:42.590
which is the combined mechanism. Once the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.410
names in a source and target protection domain

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.860
have been resolved, they can be combined

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.700
to create an aggregate domain. And the aggregate

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.475
logical protection domain will have entry points,

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.570
which is the union of the entry points

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:05.120
that were exported as names from the source and the target or any number of such

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.700
domains that have been combined together to create an aggregate domain. So this

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.900
combined primitive in SPIN is mainly useful

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.310
as a software engineering management tool to combat

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.420
the proliferation of many small domains. So,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.780
once again, the road map for creating services

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.680
is, write your code as a Modula-3 program with well defined entry points. And

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.510
using the SPIN mechanism of create, you

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.340
can instantiate a service and export the names

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.760
that are available in that service. And

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.180
if another logical protection domain wants to use

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.180
the names that are exported, it can do so by using the SPIN mechanism resolve

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.380
that causes the dynamic binding of the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.070
source and target logical protection domains. And

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.620
finally, the combined primitive allows aggregation of

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.150
logical protection domains to create an aggregate domain,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.750
that's the union of all the entry points that are available in the component

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.450
logical protection domains. This is it. This is the secret sauce in SPIN to get

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.430
protection and performance while allowing flexibility.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.650
Everything hinges on the strongly-typed nature

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.360
of the programming language that is being used for implementing the operating

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.110
system. That is, the language allows compile time checking, and run time

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.960
enforcement of the logical protection domains. That's the key to the success of

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.380
this approach to providing flexibility, protection,

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.250
and performance, all in one bag.
