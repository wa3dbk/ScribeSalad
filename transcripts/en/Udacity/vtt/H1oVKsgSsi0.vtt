00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.689
So, here they are. These are the tests from the provided question. And that was

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:10.241
called test as well, so I'm going to rename my test mytest, and let's see now

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:15.106
if we pass all the tests. And we do, so I'm fairly confident my code is correct now.

00:00:15.106 --> 00:00:18.193
If we wanted it to be faster, there's lots of things we could do better

00:00:18.193 --> 00:00:21.620
than this really simple, stupid approach of just going day by day. But in terms

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.726
of getting correct code, the simple approach had a lot of advantages. So I'll

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:29.422
encourage you if you want to extend this as another programming exercise to try

00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:33.528
to make it faster. But in this case we're pretty happy with this. The other

00:00:33.528 --> 00:00:37.526
thing I'll mention if this were not a programming exercise. Python has built in

00:00:37.526 --> 00:00:40.740
types for managing dates. And that would make your life a lot easier to use

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.714
those. There are lots and lots of different ways to solve this problem. Some of

00:00:43.714 --> 00:00:47.095
you may have come up with better ways than the one that I did. Certainly most of

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:50.600
you probably came up with more efficient ways. If you have an interesting way of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.879
solving I would encourage you to post that for discussion on the class forum.
