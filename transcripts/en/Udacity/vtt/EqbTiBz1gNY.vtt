3 times 10 to the 6th is three million, and 6 times 10 to the 4th is 60,000. So

00:00:06.342 --> 00:00:12.280
adding these together, we would get 3,060,000. Written in scientific notation,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.813
that is, 3.06 times 10 to the 6th. So what can you learn from this? Well you

00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:22.880
can't add things that have different powers of ten. That's like saying $400

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.641
plus $30 equals $700. That would be really great if I was being paid that. But

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.824
it would also be pretty horrible if you were shopping and all of a sudden

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:37.486
everything cost a ton of money. Luckily, this is not actually an equality. We

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:40.170
need to be careful about when we are adding numbers that are in scientific

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.269
notation.
