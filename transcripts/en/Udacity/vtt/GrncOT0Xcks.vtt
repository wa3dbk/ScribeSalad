00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.700
I wanted to spend a moment talking about individual use cases.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.230
Individual use cases are extremely valuable in understanding

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.150
expected user behavior.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.710
They're also used in, in the development shops that

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.160
use agile methods in doing some of their planning and scheduling.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.460
What it essentially is is a story illustrating a specific act,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.520
interaction between a user and a system.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.290
I've listed here a story about buying from Amazon.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.144
It's written out as just narrative text.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.300
And there's no structure to it, but nevertheless,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.330
it's a way of expressing, in a very user centered form, a system requirement.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.760
We could take this same story and also express it in a structured way.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.509
Here in tabular form is the same story, in particular there are three columns,.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.490
The column on the left is the actor, okay?

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.490
And there are two actors here, the user and the Amazon website.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.350
There are various actions that could take place.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.320
And sometimes, optionally,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.560
there are objects, okay, that are used by the actor to perform the action, or

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.170
produced by the action, and those are in the right-most column.
