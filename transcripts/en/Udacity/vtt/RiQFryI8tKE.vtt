00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here's my solution. I have to define the start state given a set of people that are on the here side.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I have to define the here side and just make sure that we throw in the flashlight there.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Then on the other side there's nobody.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Lowest&lt;u&gt;cost&lt;u&gt;search--starting from the start state, we've already defined the successor function.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm defining a new function to test for a goal.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We already defined the cost function.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The new function to test for the goal is right here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It says if not here--in other words, if there's nothing here, if there's nobody here at all,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
it's the empty set, or if here is only the set of the flashlight.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
That normally wouldn't happen, but I guess it could happen

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
if the initial problem was there's no people and just a flashlight.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Then you've got a solution with doing nothing at all.

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I just wanted to make sure I covered that trivial case.
