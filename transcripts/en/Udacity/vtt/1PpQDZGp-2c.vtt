00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first thing you have to do is figure out that this is actually a product.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's #5. Because you have multiple data points, the probabilities multiply.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Going to the logarithm, we replace it with a sum that is #6.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And the logarithm of the expression in the exponent is just its argument

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which means #3 is the solution here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You simply just copy those argument over.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The first derivative loses all of these terms over here. They don't depend on µ.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But it would change this one over here.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The answer ends up being 4, Xi-µ/σ² and the reason is the way the derivative works.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We take the derivative of this expression.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There's a 2 over here that gets multipled left and a minus sign in front of the µ.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Those get multiplied in and then canceled out with -1/2.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now from here to here, I just multiplied with σ²and now I bring the µ out

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and import this and the resulting expression is Nµ.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The N comes in because we have N additions of µ in the formula over here.

00:01:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That completes the entire proof.
