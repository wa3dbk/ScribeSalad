Hi everybody, I'm Cameron Pittman.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.740
Welcome to this short course
on JavaScript promises.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.750
Every web developer needs to be
able to handle asynchronous work

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.900
with confidence and ease,
and that's why you're here.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.200
You're here to take advantage
of native JavaScript promises.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.240
There are many methods to handle
asynchronous work already.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.630
However, as you'll be
discovering in this course,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.400
promises are the recommended option,
because they give you flexibility,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.450
intuitive syntax, and
easy error handling.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.259
But before we start all that,
I have an off topic question for you.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:38.026
[SOUND] You're looking
at millions of stars in

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:41.545
the disk of our Milky Way galaxy.

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:43.580
Every dot is a star.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.500
Some are bigger and brighter than
the sun, others smaller and dimmer.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.410
But what else is in this picture?

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.300
Planets.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.840
Every single star in the Milky Way
is the possible home for

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.830
dozens of alien worlds.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.740
That means it's likely
that there are hundreds of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.080
billions of planets in our galaxy alone.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.550
The Kepler Space Observatory
has found more

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.140
than 1,000 exoplanets like this
one in the last few years.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.400
Combined with data
from other telescopes,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.000
astronomers have confirmed sightings
of almost 2,000 exoplanets.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.430
That's a lot of worlds.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.880
I had an idea when I was
designing this class, and

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.690
I call it the Exoplanet Explorer.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.090
It's a web app that helps people learn
about real planets around other stars.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.120
Throughout this class, you'll be using
promises to request real JSON data about

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.910
exoplanets, and that data is
coming from NASA and CalTech.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.720
You'll be using promises to turn that
data into useful information in the app.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.690
Are you ready to get started?
