00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.090
Let's look at one more example.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.910
In this visualization, we're looking at the average price of

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.570
one carat diamonds between the years 1978 and 1982.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.140
What this is trying to convey, is that while the price of diamonds peaked in

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.430
1980, there's been a sharp decline in the two years leading up 1982.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.796
We can see here that the price has fallen from $60,000 to

00:00:19.796 --> 00:00:22.420
$20,000 given the decreasing demand.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.540
There are a few problems with this visualization,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.470
which makes it hard to interpret as a viewer.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.210
Let's start with the picture of the woman.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.490
While this particular visual is interesting,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.370
it takes up a great deal of space and isn't adding any additional information.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.260
Also, the underlying chart axes make it hard to

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.540
detect where each point on the line is in relation to the year and price.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.140
The grid lines, which show something like graph paper, are meant to convey this

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.690
is something chart-like but they detract from the main visualization.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.860
Here, the data is actually only represented by this red line,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.260
everything else about this visualization, including the picture of the woman,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.350
the grid lines, and the background, are all detracting from the main event.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.940
Which is that the price of diamonds has fallen from the years of 1980 to 1982.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.450
Let's look at an example of how we can improve this visualization to make it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.040
something that is much more clear.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.580
Here we see the same visualization with the woman and

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.220
the price of diamonds between the years of 1978 and 1982.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.590
By removing the elements such as the picture, the gridlines, and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.790
putting standard axes for

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.910
both X and Y, we can see the same information much more clearly.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.750
We've also added dots to indicate the data points for each of the x and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.630
y values.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.800
This graph while not as salacious as the original is much easier to read.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.390
And much more clearly shows the relation between the years and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.740
the price of diamonds over time.
