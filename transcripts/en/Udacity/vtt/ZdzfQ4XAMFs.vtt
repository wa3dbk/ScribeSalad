00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.460
Let me give you another algebraic
interpretation of principal components,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.380
and eventually this will
just get us to our formulas.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.270
Here we have our point P, and
let's supposed we have some origin.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.450
If we want to minimize the square of
the distance from the point to a line,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.350
we want to find the line
to minimize this square.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.660
Well, you remember Pythagoreans Theorem,
of course you do, right.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.680
It's that the sum of the squares of
the two legs of a right triangle

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.990
are equal to the square
of the hypotenuse.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.270
If we want to minimize the square
distance of the point to that line

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.360
we can, the same thing as maximizing the
projection of that point on the line.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.250
That's what this value is here, right?

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.900
X transpose P.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.000
X is some unit vector through
the origin, and if we project P

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.290
on to it that's going to be the vector
and you want to maximize that length.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.800
So minimizing the sum of the squares,
the distance to the line is the same

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.400
thing as maximizing the sum of the
squares, the projections on that line.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.470
A way of writing that is we
want to sum up all the squares.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.830
And this is just a little bit of
a matrix manipulation trick, right?

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.520
If I wrote my points down here right,
of x1, y1 or x2, y2.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.120
And if this was my line so
it's maybe, it's, A, B, right,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.240
if I multiply x transpose b transpose,
so now this is B, xy, xy, bx, all right?

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.760
If you multiply that all through,
what you'll realize is,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.100
it's exactly that value, okay?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.840
It's the sum over all the points of
that square of the magnitude, all right?

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.950
So.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.800
What that means is algebraically,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.170
this maximizing the projected distance,
can be written like this, right.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.510
So our goal is to maximize x transpose,
b transpose, bx.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.550
But we've got a constraint, right.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.910
X is a unit vector.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.810
So that means that x
transpose x has to equal 1.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.910
So what we have to do is we have to
maximize this subject to a constraint.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.850
All right, so
that's what this says here.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.850
And I wrote is as m.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.288
Maximize equal to x transpose mx.

00:02:10.288 --> 00:02:11.750
Where m is b transpose b.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.070
So we just have a single matrix.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.640
Now, I'm not going to tell
you a lot about this method.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.320
But I am going to introduce this quick
notion of what's called Lagrange

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.540
multipliers.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.460
Here is e and here is e prime.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.080
And you notice that what we
added to e prime is this term,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.220
lambda times 1 minus x transpose x.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.943
So Megan,
if everything is solved correctly,

00:02:35.943 --> 00:02:38.929
1 minus x transpose x should be what?

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:39.947
&gt;&gt; Zero?

00:02:39.947 --> 00:02:42.820
&gt;&gt; Whoa!
Yes, zero.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.790
So, when this thing is solved correctly,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.040
it doesn't matter what this lambda is,
right?

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.890
Because it will add zero to the term.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.700
That in a very hand wavy way, that is
the method of Legrange multipliers.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.470
It says, I'm going to put in a term

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.220
Multiplied by lambda that will
be zero at the correct solution.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.750
And then, you solve everything and

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.450
you've satisfied your,
Lagrange multiplier method.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.700
It turns out in our
case it's even easier.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.400
So that's our e prime.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.050
So, what we do now is, we take the
derivative of that new error function,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.630
e prime with respect to x,
and we get this.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.480
2 Mx plus 2 lambda x is the derivative.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.030
And, now, in order to minimize this
we set this equal to what, Megan?

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.320
&gt;&gt; Zero,
&gt;&gt; Zero, very good.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.810
We actually rehearsed
that one this time.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.790
And so when you do that, you get
this very simple equation that says,

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.370
Mx equals lambda x, alright.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.140
Forget the positive or

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.190
negative, doesn't matter because lambda
can go in either direction, all right?

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.180
So that's a very special x, right?

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.500
So when I multiply x by a matrix M,
if I get back a linear multiplier,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.320
in this case lambda, of x, that means
x is an eigenvector of the matrix M.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.630
So that means that x is going to be
an eigenvector of this B transpose B.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.450
All right?

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.010
So, this axis of least inertia.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.510
This solution where we minimize
the distance to the axes.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.790
The sum of the square distances,

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.510
which is the same as
maximizing the distance along.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.570
Says it has something
to do with this matrix,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.829
b transpose b, where b was
that list of all those points.
