00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.960
So now that we have seen how to compute

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.676
manufacturing costs, let's do a manufacturing cost quiz. Let's say

00:00:06.676 --> 00:00:09.214
that we can build a one millimeter squared processor for

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:12.156
watches, which we will call Watch Processor, or WP. Let's

00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:15.351
also say that we can build a 100 millimeter squared

00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:18.901
processor for laptops, or we will call it laptop processor

00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:21.550
or LP. Which of the following is true about their

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.340
cost? The cost of a laptop processor is 100 times

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.680
the cost of a watch processor. The cost of a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.410
laptop processor is more than a hundred times the cost of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.548
a watch processor. Or the cost of a laptop processor

00:00:34.548 --> 00:00:37.570
is less than 100 times the cost of a watch processor.
