00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.620
So for project two your first task and

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.770
probably the biggest hurdle is getting
set up with GitHub and if you're new to

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.170
GitHub we encourage you to take
our intro to Git and GitHub course.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.310
It's really fun.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.850
They did a, I love that class and
I think Caroline and

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.250
Sarah did a really nice job.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.690
&gt;&gt; I agree.
&gt;&gt; It's been really helpful.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.870
I learned a lot actually.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.660
&gt;&gt; Me too.
&gt;&gt; I know a lot of tricks About GitHub

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.690
and Git.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.930
But yeah, you gotta get your Git and
GitHub account set up.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.840
And then, you're going to fork the repo,
we have a starting point for

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.350
that resume.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.790
And so, you're going to fork that.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.970
And that creates a repo of your own.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.960
And that's on your
GitHub account online.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.720
And once you have that repo online and

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.020
you can have account you can clone
it to your computer or locally.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.560
So now you have your local clone and
can work on the code mostly.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.000
And then push your changes back.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.010
&gt;&gt; So Version Control, Durant, I'd
like to ask you, why Version Control?

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.730
What's the point?

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Version Control
often if you want to be able

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.570
to go back to an old version
of something you did before.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.900
Maybe you're trying different branches.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.860
You can try A and a B and
you can work them individually, and

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.100
you can switch back and
forth between them.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.070
In the simplest case or even just
a single revision history.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.390
You can go back to a previous version.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.050
Let's say you like something
that you did before.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.030
And you want to go back to that you
decided the new way to test ways 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.800
when you are.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.000
Go back and especially in the course
they also talk about where if there's

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.860
a bug that was introduced,
you want to go back and find it,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.340
figure out where that was.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.840
You can fix it and you can still keep
the whole history of everything you have

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.825
and move forward from there.

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:54.070
&gt;&gt; Okay, so and how important is it for

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.480
you to learn version control
in the professional world,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.930
once you're working with other
people because, it's good if you're.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.348
There is an argument, and it's a fair
argument, that if you're just working

00:02:05.348 --> 00:02:10.681
on it by yourself, you can just copy old
files into a folder and say okay, this

00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:16.046
is my old version, and I'm just going
to copy and paste into another folder.

00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:18.448
Well I have another version
that it will work on.

00:02:18.448 --> 00:02:22.246
&gt;&gt; Right and that's a good point
especially because when we're working

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:26.375
with other people, Version Control
will also track who made what changes.

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:30.835
There's something funny called git blame
where you can figure out who introduced

00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:32.520
what into the stream of edits.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.110
So it's really good when
working with other people to

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.200
be able to track alternative versions
of, whether it's code or even documents.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.980
So you go back that's pretty
much requirement working

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.230
in any kind of production
environment with other people.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.250
And even by yourself.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.790
If you want to sort of have just

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.130
trail of breadcrumbs just to sort of go
back and see what you did or what point.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.030
It's basically rewind the clock to go back
in time to find older versions of us.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.383
There's the only other way to do would
be to like name files, maybe version

00:03:09.383 --> 00:03:13.820
one, version two so you to have them
a very cluttered directory structure.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.707
These tools make it really easy
to first, create that trail so

00:03:17.707 --> 00:03:21.159
that you only see the current
files in that directory.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.358
So it keeps everything neat and
compact in your directory and

00:03:24.358 --> 00:03:27.390
then also makes a way you
can share with other people.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.930
Like through GitHub.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.920
&gt;&gt; Right, so that's interesting.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.326
Let's talk more about only
saving what you need.

00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:38.700
In git, versus because if you think
about Version Control you may be

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.270
thinking well let me just save the whole
version, all the files, one at a time.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.650
I'll archive this folder for yesterday
and then I'll copy all the files and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.640
then I will also then make my changes
and copy all the files again.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.980
So what's the difference
between what GitHub does and

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.130
if you want to do everything manually?

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.040
&gt;&gt; Right so one thing, especially now
that you're mentioning multiple files.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.850
That's something else.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.060
It's incredibly important.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.330
Imagine you had two different versions,
and

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.510
the files had to be
consistent with each other.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.280
So you can save all these
files together in one batch or

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.150
all files together in another batch.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.990
And you know that when you save
if you save them to be consistent

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.180
you can switch back and forth between
multiple files at the same time.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.160
&gt;&gt; So one cool thing is git it
doesn't necessary save all the file,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.800
it saves the differences.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.750
&gt;&gt; Yes, right.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.190
&gt;&gt; Right, so if you think about it,
it's actually genius.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.000
It's very efficient.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.232
So you don't care about
redundant lines of code.

00:04:41.232 --> 00:04:42.290
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; If you

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.770
did not touch that line of code,
Git doesn't care about it.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.430
&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.150
&gt;&gt; So, only if you change
certain lines of the code,

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.020
Git will keep track of those changes.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; because it will assume that if you

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.470
have a section of the code that you
don't touch it will do anything.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.330
It will just assume that it
will just be there forever.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's super smart that way.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.720
And also you can view the differences
between each version.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.310
So instead of looking these
ginormous files you can see like

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.700
he just changed these
lines versus those lines.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.450
Really helpful for trying to track down.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for giving us the
overview of why GitHub is important, and

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.990
gives you control.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.820
&gt;&gt; This particular tutorial is very

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.040
helpful in just understanding
the basics of Git.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.430
Just the absolute high level
of what base commands are and

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.790
what you need to do just
to get started off.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.420
The link is try.github.io it would have but

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.520
[INAUDIBLE] the first level of the first challenge.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.610
And I spoke about this already now

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.640
you can see it on my screen you
can see that there's, it's got

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.170
a terminal it's got a version of file system then you can use.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.465
Just to see how changes have been made.

00:05:53.465 --> 00:05:57.020
So when you start off the first thing
you do is you want to create a git repo

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.010
on your system.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.460
So that is done by a user

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.740
the git init command which is
the initialization should be done.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.166
Once you enter that on your terminal
you will see that there will be a .git

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:10.199
folder that will be generated and

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.500
inside that you can see
a whole bunch of sub branches.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.062
You won't have to make any changes
to these, these are just used for

00:06:19.062 --> 00:06:22.600
the internal git workings so
in work the git in future.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.900
It will be it'll be using all of
these to make changes whenever needed.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:33.497
So once you created your Git repo
the next step is to do git status so

00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:37.506
git status can use periodically throughout your.

00:06:37.506 --> 00:06:39.910
Working with Git just to see
where your system lies and

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.510
what you're working with right now.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.010
So many do git status.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.400
You will see that it tells you
that you're on the master branch.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.970
And there's nothing to commit.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.060
So again.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.530
[INAUDIBLE] that I said previously.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.140
The branch that will be on your system,
the local branch is called master and.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.430
Your remote branch
will be called origins.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.230
These are the default names.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.260
So, if you go ahead and

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.070
add the octocat.txt file, as you
can see in the works of the system.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.080
If you add that into your Git folder and

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.890
you do a git status again it'll
tell you that there's a new folder,

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.960
I mean there's a new file, and
that it's an untracked file.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.680
So when a file's untracked,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.520
what it is basically telling you to
do is it means you commit that file.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.160
But before you do that it's
always good practice to stage it.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.170
Staging a file is essentially just

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.920
a medium where you're confirming
that the file that you want to add

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.130
into your directory is the correct
file and it has the right changes.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.256
So to do that we do Git add
and the name of the file and

00:07:46.256 --> 00:07:52.527
that will give you a comment saying that
the file is now on the staging area.

00:07:52.527 --> 00:07:54.504
Again you do a Git status just to.

00:07:54.504 --> 00:07:57.168
ensure that there are on the web so

00:07:57.168 --> 00:08:03.090
it does us that the Git file that
is added now needs to be commited.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.231
So once the file has been
staged by using Git add,

00:08:07.231 --> 00:08:13.760
you'll get to commit so as you can see
the work goes from git init.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.630
Then you git add and
then you git commit again.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:25.322
So you commit this file and
you see that it's been added.

00:08:25.322 --> 00:08:30.042
So this is the basic steps that you
need to follow to ensure that the file

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:34.202
that you're working with gets
added on to the staging area and

00:08:34.202 --> 00:08:37.241
then gets committed into your code.

00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:44.721
And then, it's the same process
that goes over and over again.

00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:47.432
You will see that if you add more files.

00:08:47.432 --> 00:08:51.685
If you want to stage all these
files at the same time you can do

00:08:51.685 --> 00:08:57.646
a Git star,

00:08:57.646 --> 00:09:02.120
Git add.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.999
Star is a wildcard that says that any
files that have the .txt extension can

00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:08.110
be added.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.815
So I do that and that will ensure that
all the files that you've added

00:09:11.815 --> 00:09:14.670
into your Git folder
are now in the staging area.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.140
And then you can do
the exact same thing.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.770
You can commit them.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.131
To ensure that they go through
a staging area into your Git code.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.786
And there you go.

00:09:24.786 --> 00:09:31.050
So far we've seen git init,
git status, git add and git commit.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.440
After this,
there's another command called git log.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.210
A git log is, it's essentially if
you want to see more information for

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.100
each commit, you can use git log.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.490
You can see more information for
each commit, we're going to use git log.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.560
You can see where the files are added or
where files are committed.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.520
Uphold the basic method for
that information.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.630
So if I do Git log,

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:58.100
you will see that every commit has
a particular code associated with it.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.350
And it tells you who the author was,
what date it was, and

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.620
what changes were made in each file.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.450
So this is,

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.140
I was just giving you a quick
through of this particular tutorial.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.220
You can go ahead and use this.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.530
It's not going to take you more than,

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:17.700
say twenty minutes to actually
go through this entire tutorial.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.650
It explains how to work with more
people's hardware, basic Git Branch.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.910
How to do a basic Git Merge.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:30.510
&gt;&gt; Let's just talk
about footer to GitHub.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:36.000
because I've also noticed some
people look confused between Git and GitHub.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.
All right.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.270
&gt;&gt; Let's talk about that.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.370
Let me clarify some questions.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.030
That I've noticed.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:49.181
&gt;&gt; So what is the difference between
Git and GitHub and do you need one or

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:51.611
the other or can you use one without the other,

00:10:51.611 --> 00:10:56.026
yeah what's the typical workflow
if you're versioning things?

00:10:56.026 --> 00:10:59.790
&gt;&gt; Right,
the relationship is that Git is

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.160
software that anyone can use anyone
can download, it's open source and

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.830
you can host it from any
particular website that you want.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.960
GitHub is a particular company and their
business model is to host, right and

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.260
to make some extra tools to
make it easier for a using kit.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.510
You can do everything on the command
line but with GitHub, they just have

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:24.540
a really nice interface for posting
your projects and for downloading.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.470
Repositories, that sort of thing.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:32.380
&gt;&gt; Right so to Durant's point,
just want to drive this home.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:38.170
GitHub is just an online server
where you can just host your code,

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.420
share your code and collaborate.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.906
Git is actually the system
itself, the actual command line

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:51.783
system that you will learn in
our Udacity course.

00:11:51.783 --> 00:11:56.156
So that if there was this just a dry
content relationship you how often

00:11:56.156 --> 00:12:00.781
developers as they actually
developed locally on their machine.

00:12:00.781 --> 00:12:05.673
They use Git commands to
commit, save your versions and

00:12:05.673 --> 00:12:11.106
once they want to share their code,
once their code is done,

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:15.467
they actually write
a command called Git push.

00:12:15.467 --> 00:12:20.180
They'll push this code to GitHub and
from GitHub you can

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:24.993
then share your code and
then GitHub will have supporting

00:12:24.993 --> 00:12:30.280
functions to be able to help
you collaborate with people.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.060
Once you've shared it
people can then download

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.735
your code onto to their own local
machine and then they'll work on it.

00:12:39.735 --> 00:12:44.465
And then, and if they say okay,
I have this great function,

00:12:44.465 --> 00:12:47.805
addition to your code,
I'm going to upload it to my GitHub and

00:12:47.805 --> 00:12:51.532
then I'm going to submit
what we call pull requests.

00:12:51.532 --> 00:12:55.062
Where we just merge and say okay I
think this is a really good feature.

00:12:55.062 --> 00:12:59.841
We should add it to the main code,

00:12:59.841 --> 00:13:05.062
that's people work in a nutshell.

00:13:05.062 --> 00:13:07.120
And on Git and GitHub.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.760
&gt;&gt; And even your GitHub repository, I've
heard people say that it's almost a,

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.170
could almost be a substitute for
a resume or

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.140
a CV, like you'll just give someone-
&gt;&gt; Good point, yeah.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.330
&gt;&gt; Your GitHub Repository and
say you these are all my projects.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.230
Look on to all my projects.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.680
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; It's good, the projects speak for

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.520
themselves, they'll look at your code,
they could ask you questions about them.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they'll ask you questions and
they'll also, if you collaborate online,

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.310
if you collaborate with
open source projects or

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.620
other projects, they'll be able to see
how you work with other people online or

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.170
how you collaborate
with other developers.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:47.270
And that's a very crucial skill
that they'll be looking at so.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.790
We highly encourage you to start your
GitHub account, and start using Git and

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.080
start being comfortable with it,
because it will only help you.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.420
If you don't use Git, you can forget.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:00.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.801
&gt;&gt; You forget what this command you.

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:08.436
I'm thinking, okay,
I want to merge this branch but I have

00:14:08.436 --> 00:14:12.240
this past commit for mergin how
do you want to do it?

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it is a complicated
system but Sarah and Caroline do a great

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.170
job of clarifying it and showing
you some real world use cases for

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.670
it so I definitely also work your
way through the Udacity course.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.380
It might be a struggle because if it's
new material it will be hard to get

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.880
through, but
it should certainly help you out.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.330
&gt;&gt; Awesome, well an application
we just found, someone just

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:40.900
programmed an interactive practice tool,
like a little tool to practice with Git.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.200
Let's just look at,
I don't know a Git commit.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.490
&gt;&gt; Git commit, let's do it.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.360
Okay so I click Git commit, and
here's a little diagram, and

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.860
there's master and head.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.590
And if I just Git commit.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.880
And I Git commit again.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.760
You can see the diagram updating and

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.110
master and
head move along with the head.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.700
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.220
&gt;&gt; So it gives you a visual
representation of actually what's going

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.530
on with your versions
because think of every circle

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.380
as a version of
the whole entire project.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So every circle is a commit.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.880
AKA, it's just the version
that you see it in.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.870
It's a snapshot of the past.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.240
Basically.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.330
And this is basically you can think
about Git as a time machine, capsule.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:27.900
You go to launch all these
commands to manage this time machine.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.640
So basically,
if everyone watches Doctor Who,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.040
it's kind of like your Tardis.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:37.150
Everyone's Tardis here in
the software development world.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.725
GitHub is the ability to
see everyone else's Tardis.

00:15:40.725 --> 00:15:44.638
And get access to their version control,

00:15:44.638 --> 00:15:49.890
their commits, and their code history.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.260
Yeah so play around with this.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.590
As you're learning the commands as
you're going through the course.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.780
Just come back to here,
this web page, and

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.720
it will actually dynamically
build this diagram for you.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.562
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So cool Mark sent that

00:16:00.562 --> 00:16:03.270
to the rest of us today.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:03.810
Thanks Mark.
