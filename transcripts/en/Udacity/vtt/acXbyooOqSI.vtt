00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.628
The number was 3, 9, 2, 7, 1, 5, 4. So when I asked you to remember the

00:00:08.628 --> 00:00:12.608
numbers, you probably began rehearsing them in your head. But was it harder to

00:00:12.608 --> 00:00:16.560
remember the number correctly when I started saying other numbers? Often times

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.005
that little distracter, just hearing the other numbers, will interfere with

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:24.862
your rehearsal of this number. So in order for the mateiral being this number

00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:28.102
to be retained, we need to somehow get the information into our long term

00:00:28.102 --> 00:00:29.829
memory.
