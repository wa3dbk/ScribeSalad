The answer is polymorphism. Polymorphism means that a method call such as here

00:00:04.898 --> 00:00:09.182
the call to display reaches the correct method at run time depending on what

00:00:09.182 --> 00:00:16.045
this variable refers to, the correct version of display is fit. Polymorphism is

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:20.838
great because it make systems extensible. I can add new classes to the system,

00:00:20.838 --> 00:00:24.996
such as new types of questions, and still reuse the present question method

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:28.333
without having to change it.
