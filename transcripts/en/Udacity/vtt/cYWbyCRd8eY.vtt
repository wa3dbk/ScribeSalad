00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.355
Okay.

00:00:00.357 --> 00:00:04.344
This is a great review of fractions. But what else can we do with fractions?

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.772
With the counting numbers, we can add, subtract, multiply and divide. We can do

00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:12.898
the same operations with fractions. You might be asking yourself, what's an

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.176
operation. An operation is just something that takes input values and produces

00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:21.774
an output value. Like addition, we could have 2 plus 3. 2 and 3 are the inputs,

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:26.318
and I get 5 as the output. Or, I could have 4 times 7. 4 and 7 are my inputs,

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:30.941
and I get 28 as the output. An operation just produces a new value. For now,

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:35.862
we're going to continue working with fractions and look at multiplication. But

00:00:35.874 --> 00:00:39.324
we're going to return to our chocolate bars. Here's my one chocolate bar. This

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:42.566
time, I'm going to split up my chocolate bar into pieces. I'm going to find a

00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:46.373
fraction of a fraction. So what is 1 3rd of one half of the chocolate bar? Let's

00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:49.984
find out. Here's a drawing of a chocolate bar. And now first, I'm going to split

00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:55.102
it in half. So I started with 1 bar and now I have half a bar. I want to find 1

00:00:54.858 --> 00:00:59.710
3rd of that oine half. So, I need to take this half of a chocolate bar and split

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:04.524
it up into thirds, or three equal pieces. I've split my half into thirds now.

00:01:04.638 --> 00:01:09.671
And now I just need 1 3rd of the one half. So this piece right here represents 1

00:01:09.427 --> 00:01:14.728
3rd of my one-half. So, I found 1 3rd of one half. It's this shape piece. But,

00:01:14.832 --> 00:01:19.709
I'm wondering, what fraction is this piece compared to the original candy bar? I

00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:24.355
can split up my original candy bar into the same size pieces as this one. That

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:28.825
will let me see what fraction is this of my candy bar. So visually I can see

00:01:28.837 --> 00:01:33.548
that this piece is 1 6ths of my. My candy bar. So let's pair this with some

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.284
math. 1 3rd of one half has to be equal to 1 6th but I need to figure out what

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:41.330
did I do to these two fractions. How did I combine them to get 1 6ths? Let's

00:01:41.342 --> 00:01:43.154
answer this question with a quiz.
