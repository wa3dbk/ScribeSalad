00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now it's time for a quiz to see how well you understand lists.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Your goal is to define a variable with the name "stooges"

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
whose value is a list of the names of the Three Stooges.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If you're rusty on who the Three Stooges were,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the names of the Three Stooges were Moe, Larry, and Curly.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And remember that a list is ordered, so it's important

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that those values are in the list in the correct order,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which is Moe first, Larry second, and Curly third.
