Industrial and organizational psychology focuses on two distinct sets of

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.490
problems. The industrial side involves matching employees to their job and

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.310
using psychological principles to select employees and evaluate job

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.100
performance. The industrial side of IO psychology is sometimes referred to as

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.730
personnel psychology. The organizational side focuses on making workers more

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.710
productive. In addition, they examine how management styles and environment

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.060
influence motivation, satisfaction and productivity. IO psychology is one of

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.026
the fastest growing subdisciplines in psychology.
