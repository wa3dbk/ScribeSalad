00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.638
Determining what constitutes a mental illness can be a difficult task. Because

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:07.932
there's not a specific test, for example a blood test or an x-ray, that can

00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:13.176
tell us which disorder a person may have. However, over the past 200 years,

00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:17.732
many industrialized countries have categorized psychological abnormalities

00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:23.805
using a medical model. The medical model is that conceptualization of

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:29.135
psychological abnormality as diseases. But like physical diseases have

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:34.642
biological causes, defined symptoms and possible cures. Therefore the first

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:38.902
step to determining the nature of a problem is through diagnosis. Before

00:00:38.902 --> 00:00:43.118
discussing the process of diagnosing mental disorders, it's imperative to know

00:00:43.118 --> 00:00:47.210
that psychiatric labels can have negative consequences, including negative

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.052
stereotypes. Or stigma. In fact, some research has suggested that nearly 70% of

00:00:54.052 --> 00:01:00.500
people with a diagnosable psychological disorder do not seek treatment. We hope

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.280
that through this course we can educate you, as well as other students, in an

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.060
effort to help decrease a negative stigmatization associated with mental

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.229
illness.
