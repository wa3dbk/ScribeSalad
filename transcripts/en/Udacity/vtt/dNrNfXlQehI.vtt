00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's an additional little nugget at the end. Let's make this function more complicated.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's say that what I want to do is find the word that has an "l" closest to the end of it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So for example, here in "Bible" the "l" is in position 4.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In "Kingsolver, it's in 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, position something--I can't count.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5--position 6.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Alright, and for the others, it's -1.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well, we can do that with our find function.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So we'll just pass in lpos, and this should work, right?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Actually there may be a bug here. Let's see it in a minute.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Ha! That didn't seem very good.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We got "Bible" instead of "Kingsolver".

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
What could go wrong?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Well, now let's put back in some of our debugging, make sure all the steps

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
along the way are working out.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Oh! Look at this. The f_value is none every time. Why is that?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I could have sworn I was writing a function that was returning--Oh! Oh! I forgot the word return.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The default return value for a function is none if you don't say anything.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So let's try running it again.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And now, the return values are as expected and "Kingsolver,"

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which has an "l" in position 6, beats out "Bible" with its "l" in position 3,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and we return "Kingsolver."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now here, I had to add in 2 more lines just to make this simple function.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It turns out that Python has a trick called lambda that let's you make a function

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
in the middle of nowhere, and it looks something like this.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Here, instead of making this function "l" position that returns word.find,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I use lambda, which means make me a function.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I don't have to call it anything because I'm only going to use it right here.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Its argument is word, and its return value is word.find("l").

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The word return is implicit when you use lambda.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Just to make sure this is working, I will totally delete our definition of lpos,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and add some new "Super Long This L Comes Last" word,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and it should beat out all the others.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Actually, it won't. Now it will. Case matters.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Oh! And here's our answer.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This function made with lambda--these are sometimes called anonymous functions--

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
had exactly the same semantics--exactly the same meaning as our previous

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
lpos function, -1, 6, -1, -1, 3, but now "Super Long This L Comes Last" is 16.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So it wins.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So this time, we saw together how to write this function findmax.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We also got a little experience with writing list test cases,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
where you typically want at least order, reverse, and random,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and another good one is actually empty,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
but in this problem description, we were guaranteed nonempty.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
A bit about how to do print debugging.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Everywhere there's something interesting in your code,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
you just print out some values and then you can look at them.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And right at the end a little bit about lambda.

00:02:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Super productive! I hope you'll join me next time.
