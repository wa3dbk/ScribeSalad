00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.556
First we're going to find every deviation from the respective sample mean, and

00:00:04.556 --> 00:00:10.111
then we'll square each deviation. Then, we can find each sum of squares for

00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:16.114
each sample and then, we add up each sum of squares. In this case, we get 862.

00:00:16.114 --> 00:00:18.539
Great job, this was the hard part.
