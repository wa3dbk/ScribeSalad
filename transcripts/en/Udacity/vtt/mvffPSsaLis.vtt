00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And here's a graph--it's kind of a binary tree, starting from h and expanding the nodes

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
using breadth first search, when node o be added to the open list.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So, assuming that h is 1 and each of the nodes is going to get added

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
one at a time into the open list, eventually o will get added.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What level will it be. Write your answer in the box.
