00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Of these options, the third one, the fourth one, and the sixth one are useful.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In the first one, the public key for Udacity is inside of the hash,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and so we have no way of actually getting that. So that's not useful.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
For the second one, the encryption is done using Udacity's private key,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so this is a self-signed certificate, which is not very useful for us.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The fifth one is not useful, because the host name "udacity.commune" is not bound with the key.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We would need to include that in the inputs of the encryption.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The third and fourth ones are useful.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We have our host name. We have our public key.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Both of these are inside the encryption.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
For the sixth option, this is is a certificate chain.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We have from the certificate authority the public key of trusty certs.

00:00:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The trusty certs signs the public key of Udacity and binds it to udacity.com.
