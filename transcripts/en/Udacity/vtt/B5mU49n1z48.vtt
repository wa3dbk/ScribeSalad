00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, when you are managing a successful product,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you will get many of these bug reports,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and you must make sure that no bug report ever gets lost

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and also that all these bug reports eventually get handled in finite time.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Before that you'll have to store these problem reports somewhere

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that you can classify them, mark them, and evaluate them.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is the talk of a problem database.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Simply speaking, a problem database holds all problems

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that ever occurred with some product.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Whenever somebody reports a problem,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
either though an automatic means or as a regular user,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
all of these problems get stored in the problem database.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You may wonder how many of these bug reports

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
end up with large companies over time.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Actually, these problem databases are huge.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I don't know how this is for Apple,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but I've been the first non-Microsoft researcher ever to peek into

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the problem database of Microsoft.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I can't tell you exact number of bug reports that are in there,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but if you consider that Microsoft has sold 450 million

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
of Windows 7 licenses.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If every user just experiences one such crash per month,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that's more than 37 million bug reports each year.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is only from people who actually click on the send button.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I guess there's a number of people who run Microsoft

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but don't have a proper licence and prefer not to tell Microsoft

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
about their problems.
