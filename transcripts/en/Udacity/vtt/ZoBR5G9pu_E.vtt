00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.880
In this case it should be clear that the

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.640
answer is yes, because branch and condition coverage actually includes

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.580
branch coverage. Therefore, by definition, any test rate that

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.505
satisfies branch and condition coverage

00:00:10.505 --> 00:00:12.664
will necessarily satisfy branch coverage.
