00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.096
In the example shown here, remember we
talked about a feature space that may be

00:00:04.096 --> 00:00:05.780
four by four by four for RGB?

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.731
Well they did 16 by 16 by 16, and

00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:13.170
then they manually selected
a target on the first frame.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.160
So you can see here that, see this
ellipse that's been put down here,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.568
and this ellipse that's
been put down there?

00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:22.640
They, they specified that in advance and
they said, go, and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.830
that one starts going, and I guess they
go here, and that one starts going.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.640
And I want you to notice,
whoops let's get rid of the,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.650
how well those mean shift models
stick to the players, okay?

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.570
The average number of
iterations was only four,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.480
that is from one frame to another,
they had to move,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.030
do the mean shift thing four
times to track the density.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.830
They also worried about scale, in terms
of looking at how the the scale changed.
