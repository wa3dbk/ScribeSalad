Solving this equation, might have felt really simple to you but there's

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.928
actually something really important going on here. This is highlighting a

00:00:06.928 --> 00:00:11.595
certain property that exponents have. If we have an equation like this one, a

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:17.200
to the x equals a to the y, then we know right away that x must equal y. This

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.856
property also works the other way around. If we know that x equals y, then we

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:26.970
also know that a to the x is equal to a to the y. Now that we've talked about

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.484
that concept, here's a slightly harder problem to try. This time we have 4 to

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:36.099
the x minus 1 power equals 64. What is x now?
