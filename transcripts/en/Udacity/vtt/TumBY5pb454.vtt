00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.727
Here are the solutions were 6 plus or minus the square root of 31. Great work

00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:08.797
if you found those two answers. We subtract 5 from both sides of the equation

00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:13.997
to get this. Next we identify the b so that way we can complete the square. The

00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:18.963
b value is negative 12, which means b over 2 is negative 6. And b over 2

00:00:18.963 --> 00:00:23.381
squared is positive 36. We add this amount to both sides of our equations, so

00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:28.373
that way we can complete the square. We rewrite the left hand side as x minus 5

00:00:28.373 --> 00:00:33.710
squared, and the right hand side as 31. Next, we take the square root of both

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.430
sides of the equation to get x minus 6 equals plus or minus the square root of

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.008
31. And finally, we add 6 to both sides of the equation to get our final

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.350
answers. Here, we can't simplify the square root of 31 since 31 is a prime

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.737
number. The only factors of 31 are 31 and 1.
