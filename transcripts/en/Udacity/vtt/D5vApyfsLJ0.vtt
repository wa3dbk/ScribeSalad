00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.650
Now, before we continue, I would like to make one important point,

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.080
and I don't know if this already occurred to you,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.000
but at least you might be inclined to think that it's rather obvious that

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.110
the problem that Alice, Bob, and Carol are working on is intractable for one simple reason.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.310
Each of their problems has to look at an exponential number of solutions.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.410
For vertex cover, we have O(2^n) potential solutions that we have to look at

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.100
because there are 2^n 0-1 assignments to the vertices

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.840
for putting the vertices of a graph into a vertex cover.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.650
And the same thing is true for independent set and clique as we have seen in the last unit.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.100
Now, the question is does the fact that there is an exponential number of solutions

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.440
already mean that the problem must be intractable.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.610
You could basically think this because having to consider an exponential number of solutions

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.620
might mean that you have to look at each one of the solutions

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.220
and that obviously is going to take exponential time.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.810
What I now want to show you is that this is not the correct intuition to have.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.920
Having many solutions does not mean that the problem is intractable.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.200
It can mean this, but it does not have to.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.110
To show you this, I'm going to give you one example

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
where we have an exponential number of solutions

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.310
but actually there is a polynomial time algorithm for our problem.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.880
What I would like you to tell me--in this graph here,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.190
how many different paths or how many different ways there are

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.080
of getting from A to B if you cannot go backwards?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.150
You start out at A and once you've traveled across an edge you cannot go backwards.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.180
You always have to go forward, so how many ways are there to get from A to B?

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.240
Of course this is a very simple warm up example.

00:01:44.240 --> 99:59:59.000
I'm going to draw a little arrows here just to make clear that we cannot go backwards.
