00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.250
One way to think about a delegate
is to imagine that each

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.270
key difference one sees across
views of the same class,

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.420
corresponds to a question that
the view could ask of its delegate.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.170
For example, what should I do
with these new characters?

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.110
How should I respond when
the return button is clicked?

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.700
What should happen when editing begins?

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.700
in other words,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.350
the view needs some other class to
decide what to do with user input.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.646
So, what kind of object can
answer these questions?

00:00:28.646 --> 00:00:33.963
The view's delegate is usually, but not
strictly, going to be a control object.

00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:37.675
It makes sense for control objects
to answer the view's questions,

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:41.323
because control objects are designed
to perform tasks like passing

00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:43.680
user input to a data model.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.710
The key to the delegate pattern, is that
the view establishes the questions that

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.530
it needs answered and
encodes them in a protocol.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.240
A protocol is a list of methods
that a delegate must implement.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.670
Any object that fulfills
the protocol can become a delegate.
