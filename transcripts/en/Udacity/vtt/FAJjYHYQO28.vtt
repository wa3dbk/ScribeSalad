00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.770
So that was a quick examination of the affect of one quality,

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.260
performance, on one architectural style.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.120
Let's look at the affect of another quality,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.790
maintainability, on pipe and filters.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.180
On the positive side each of the filters in a pipeline is

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.459
an independent unit and this enhance, enhances encapsulation and reusability.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.535
On the other hand some changes,

00:00:24.535 --> 00:00:28.280
like the format of the data that's going through the pipe line may affect,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.683
all the, all of the filters, thereby increasing their coupling.
