00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.800
So let's look at edge detection with a simple example.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.120
I'm going to give you my usual, simple image.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.890
Let's use this as an example, and see what we can do with it.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.180
So the basic idea of edge detection is, we want to look for

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.770
a neighborhood with strong signs of change.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.930
So let's, for example, look at this pixel, or this neighborhood of one,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.960
and look at it with respect to the other pixels around it.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.150
How much is the change from here to there?

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.470
How much is the change from here to here and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.580
also basically just in that neighborhood of these pixels here, figure out,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.270
oh is there a big discontinuity here?

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.820
And of course, there is a significant discontinuity 12 intensity to 90.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.550
We can basically start looking at that one by one throughout the whole image, so

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.600
of course the same when I look at this.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.720
And I compare it with this.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.350
There's a discontinuity, a significant one between these two.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.560
However, not much so between 90 and 89.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.590
Looking at this pixel here, I would also, also have the same type of comparison.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.950
Much more discontinuity here.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.537
Of course, I didn't go down all the way here, but

00:01:02.537 --> 00:01:06.680
if you notice, 89, 86, 87, 82 were somewhat similar.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.940
Not exactly the same.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.890
I mean there is discontinuity, just not a significant one.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.150
But between 12 and 88 much more.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.180
Again we can keep coming down this way.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.080
And 9 and 10 have discontinuity, 15 and 12 have discontinuity, but small.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.677
So [INAUDIBLE] when I hit 12,

00:01:21.677 --> 00:01:25.530
you basically notice a significant discontinuity here.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.530
And also between 12 and 84.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.700
So this process basically as a scan through an image.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.820
I will be looking for each and every pixel and

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.570
look in the neighborhood, the four connected next to it itself and say,

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.660
okay, do I need to put something between those pixels to create an edge?

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.440
And I can just go through the whole process and see how this looks for

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.640
this instance, and you can basically see that, of course, just by looking at

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.620
a contin, discontinuities between different types of things, we can create

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.140
this simple, line, which separates out this part of the image with that one.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.040
Or basically points out that there is a discontinuity between it.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.360
Here is another way of looking at it.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.090
Basically, now I've just given those gray values and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.850
now I can see the edge between the two.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.040
Becomes much more clearer this way also.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.470
So as we do this, we have to think about various things.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.410
What is the size of the neighborhood?

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.060
I started off with basically the assumption that the neighborhood size.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.200
Which I've always referred to was one because I look at it with respect to that.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.920
Then also what metric represents a change?

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.170
And in this case we looked at saying is, well let's not basically think they

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.290
are different if the pixel intensity's different by three.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.160
But if it's several orders of in this case, of course, almost 78,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.720
we would put that as an edge.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.270
Or, in this case, you know, again, about 76,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.240
so all of those radiations are much larger.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.780
So we basically came up with some sort of a threshold, and

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.980
defined that as where we want to actually look for those changes.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.330
If there was with certain amounts, if it was above it or

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.210
not, we would actually look for that discontinuity.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.250
Of course there is discontinuity, much smaller one between each and every pixel.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.320
But we will just be looking for larger ones.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.770
So that's one more thing we have to look at.
