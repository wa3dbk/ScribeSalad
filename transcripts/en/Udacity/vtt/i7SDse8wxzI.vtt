There are two parts to the solution. The front camera and side camera are

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.870
created in a similar fashion to the top camera. The up direction needs to be

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.300
set to y up instead of the top camera's x up setting. Really, the default is y

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.942
up, but it doesn't hurt to set it. During rendering, the front and side cameras

00:00:14.942 --> 00:00:18.179
are repositioned almost identically to how the top camera is moved
