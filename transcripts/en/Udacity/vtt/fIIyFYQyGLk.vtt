00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.969
So Matt, why is interactivity so important for data visualization?

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.840
&gt;&gt; We think it's really important because it let's you understand a lot more

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.600
about the actual data that's shown in a graph.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.010
So instead of not being able to see what the actual name or

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.550
object or company that you're looking at in a graph is, if you have, let's say,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.770
text on the hover, and the ability to zoom and toggle.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.180
You can really explore the graph and the data further.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.080
So we actually have an example here that shows why this works pretty well.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.300
So here we can see four degrees of data about this graph.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.080
So across the x axis we see per capita GDP in various countries.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.570
And across the y axis we see life expectancy in years for folks who live there.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.340
And we can do things like pull this up and

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.490
down, we can zoom in and check out the bubbles themselves.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.270
And what you can see here beyond the actual X and

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.880
Y axis is the bubbles are sized for the population of a country.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.340
And they're colored for the continent.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.129
And so you can see in the legend here the different clusters based on

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.070
the continents that they're a part of.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.000
And so by being able to see more than just the normal x and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.790
y plotting, you can see things about clusters of continents, for example.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.360
If like here, you can see.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.220
These are mostly continents that are, or countries that are in Africa.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.900
And then up here, you have more of a concentration the Americas and Europe.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.040
And then also, by being able to, by it being web-based,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.630
we can do things like embed live graphs or live links into it.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.790
So you can link back to the source of the,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.390
of data if you'd like to show where it comes from.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.910
We can also show the actual data behind the graph.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.220
So any time you make a graph,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.940
you don't have to worry about whether your data's lost.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.690
And then we can actually show the code for it.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.660
So you can see how to remake that from different programming languages.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.890
And so the fun thing is then once you've made that graph you don't just have to

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.170
share it at a link here, though you can.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.430
You can actually just put it in iframes.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.870
And so it, you can then just put this on to a website so

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.520
other folks can also get that same interactive experience.
