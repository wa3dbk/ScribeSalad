00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.270
All Objective C objects inherit an init
method from the NS object class.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.920
So unlike in Swift,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.230
it's not always necessary to
implement a custom initializer.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.190
If I go into the main function
of our house project,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.020
I can initialize an instance of
the house class with no problem.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.490
You've seen this a few times now.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.930
Every time you create an object,
you type alloc, which allocates

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.450
some memory space and then init to
initialize the object instance.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.520
Alloc and
init are always written together.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.130
They're like entangled particles.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.850
They can't be separated.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.600
That being said,
this house I initialized has no address.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.180
So I think we should write
a custom initializer.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.750
We'll write our custom
initializer in the House.m file.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.120
This is the first method
we're writing together.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.080
So let's take a minute to talk about
the syntax of method definitions.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.360
Every method definition
starts with the return type.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.190
In this case, our return type
is going to be instancetype.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.170
Instancetype indicates an instance of
the class in which this method is found,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.410
in this case,
an instance of the House class.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.870
After the return type,
we'll type init, no surprise there.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.460
But generally,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.960
you're going to want to initialize
an instance of a class with some values.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.320
So it's common to name your
initializer initWithSomeProperty.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.160
In our case, we'll initWithAddress, and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.920
then we place a colon
after the method name.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.660
After the colon, we pass in our
parameter, address, and of course,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.240
address is going to be
a pointer to a string.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.550
We indicate the parameter type
here in between parentheses and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.800
include an asterisk to show that
the parameter is a pointer to an object.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.490
After the parameter type comes
the parameter itself, address, and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.610
then some curly braces to
hold the body of the method.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.891
So the general form for writing
a method definition looks like this,

00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:47.020
the returnType between parentheses,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.010
the methodName followed by a colon,
the parameterType between parentheses.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.320
If the parameter is an object,
include an asterisk, the parameterName,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.470
and then in between curly braces,
the body of the method.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.710
Now let's get back to initialization.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.940
Every init method is going to start
out by calling the init method of its

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.210
superclass, which in this case,
is NSObject.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.388
So we set self = [super init].

00:02:12.388 --> 00:02:15.890
Next we want to check that everything
went well with that call to super init.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.810
So we type if(self).

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.470
Self should have a value now, so
this statement should evaluate to true.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.410
Then in the body of this if statement,
we'll initialize our properties.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.980
I place an underscore
here before address, and

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.970
this is how I access the address
instance variable directly.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.510
Remember that address is marked
with the attribute copy, so

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.830
we want to initialize it with a copy
of the string that's being passed in.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.740
This line protects the address
from the unintentional changes

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.500
we talked about earlier.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.040
So again,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.760
we set _address equal to a copy of
address, the parameter being passed in.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.380
We'll give these other
properties default values.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.130
Let's say the default
numberOfBedrooms is 2 and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.170
the default value of hasHotTub is false.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.800
When we're done setting the values
of the properties, we return self.
