00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.600
In the example we've shown here, we have three different DSL routers. The y axis

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.170
shows the round trip time, or the latency

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.880
to a nearby server in milliseconds, and is

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.210
again shown in a long scale. We started an upload at the time 30 seconds shown

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.950
on the plot. Now you can see that

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.740
different modems experience a huge increase in latency,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.520
when we start this upload. Some of them experience a latency of as much as

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.090
one second up from a typical latency of

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.100
about ten miliseconds. One particular modem saw a

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.960
round trip latency of as high as ten

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.100
seconds during uploads. Now to remind you what's

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.020
going on here, is that the modem itself has a buffer. Your ISP may be upstream

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.240
of that buffer, and your access link may

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.520
be draining that buffer at a certain rate. TCP

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.060
senders in your home will send until they

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.130
see lost packets, but if the buffer's large, the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.260
senders won't actually see those lost packets until

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.650
this buffer has already filled up. The senders continue

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.880
to send at increasingly faster rates until they

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.050
see a loss. As a result, packets that are

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.240
arriving at this buffer see increasing delays,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.110
and senders continue to send at faster rates,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.400
because without packet loss they don't have

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.110
a signal to slow down. There's several solutions

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.440
to the buffer bloat problem. One is

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.900
obviously to use smaller buffers, but given that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.940
we have a lot of deployed infrastructure,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.840
simply reducing the buffer size in deployed routers,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.100
modems, switches, home Wi-Fi devices and so forth

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.930
is a tall order. The other thing that

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.160
we can do, is to use the traffic

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.590
shaping methods that we have learned about. Consider that

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.760
the buffer drains at a particular rate, which, in this case, is the rate of the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.240
uplink to the ISP. If we shape traffic

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.020
such that traffic coming into the access link never

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.910
exceeds the uplink that the ISP has

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.330
provided us, then the buffer will never fill.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.480
Thus, by shaping traffic at the home router

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.690
such that the rate that traffic is sent

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.820
to the ISP, never exceeds the rate of the uplink, the modem buffer will never

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.990
actually fill up. This type of shaping can

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.540
be done on many open WRT capable routers,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.390
including the Bismark routers that we've developed here at Georgia Tech.
