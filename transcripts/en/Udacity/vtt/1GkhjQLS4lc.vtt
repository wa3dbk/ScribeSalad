00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.680
Do you have any idea how you plan to
start taking action towards the ideas

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.200
you have for your business?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.850
Let's start by breaking
down your mission and

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.218
vision statements into
a set of 12 month goals.

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:12.830
For your 12 month goals,
try to answer questions like.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.150
How many customers do you want to have?

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.180
How much revenue do you hope to make?

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.590
And what metrics are you looking
at to help you get there?

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.410
There are plenty of other
questions you can ask.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.220
And this really depends on the type of
impact you're hoping to have with your

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.110
business.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.630
Here's a strategy you can
use to help get started.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.720
Try thinking about a core objective
that's fundamental to the success

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.920
of your business.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.150
For example,
maybe your app needs lots of users.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.890
Can you imagine making any progress
at all and gaining these users?

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.316
How many do you think you could get?

00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:43.190
Write that number down.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.320
Now in what timeframe do you think
it would take to reach that goal?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.280
Once you have that number,
you can adjust it relative to what

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.600
portion of the goal could be
achieved within the next year.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.980
Let's look at an example of how
you might be able to use this

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.170
for your business.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.260
I feel pretty confident that I
could get ten customers in a month.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.700
So maybe 120 customers is
a good goal for my first year.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.260
Or, if 5,000 customers in my first
five years seems reasonable,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.790
then maybe I could reach a 1,000
customers by the end of year one.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.270
Start where you're comfortable and
work from there.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.060
Another idea you can try is to
look into similar businesses.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.550
Seeing where they started, and

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.390
finding out how they were
able to grow over time.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.400
And remember these goals can change.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.910
The idea right now is to really just
get something to work from later on.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.530
So take some time to think about
where you hope to be in one year, and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.810
when you're ready write
out your 12 month goals.
