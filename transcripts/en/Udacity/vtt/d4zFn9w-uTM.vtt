00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.200
Well we're with Laura Adams the CEO
of Rhode Island Quality Institute,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.650
which operates the state of Rhode
Island's Health Information Exchange,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.400
called Current Care.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.420
Laura, I really appreciate your
taking the time to be with us today.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.110
The Current Care has a very
interesting history,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.830
dating all the way back to 2001.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.190
If you could just explain that to us and

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.330
maybe the role that you played in
getting SureScripts launched briefly and

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.860
walk us through today,
that would be great.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.630
&gt;&gt; Certainly.
We started in 2001 as a public private

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.360
partnership.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.470
We're a 501, not for profit free
standing entity, not a state agency,

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.340
but deeply engaged with our state
as a partner in all of this.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.140
Our goal was to dramatically
improve quality, safety and value.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.973
We started out as a consortium
of leaders basically,

00:00:48.973 --> 00:00:52.820
people with our hands on the levers
of Rhode Island's healthcare system.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.240
And our first question was we'll great,
we're all in a room,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.380
we're all agreeing to collaborate,
what do we do?

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.200
We settled on information technology.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.239
My background is quality improvement and
I knew that I was stymied at every turn

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.280
because of the paper based system,
that if we were really going to improve

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.140
quality we had to go for
health information technology.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.600
So we became the place where SureScripts
decided that they would do their first

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.020
beta test of end to end true
electronic prescribing.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.550
That pilot ended up being
an incredible success and

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.660
obviously SureScripts is
nationwide now and robust and

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.910
we're very proud of that
opportunity to participate in that.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.020
&gt;From that point on,
we received the state on our behalf,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.880
the state government received
a grant from the agency for

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.980
health care research and
quality called the State and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.830
Regional Demonstrations In
Health Information Exchange.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.700
That came in 2004, and kicked off
the funding for our privacy framework,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.560
our governance framework, and our
stakeholder engagement piece of this.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.210
Along came HITECH in 2009.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.240
Our organization was the only
one to hit the trifecta,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.630
to win all three major HITECH grants.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.370
That was the Beacon, the HIE, and
the Regional Extension Center.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.300
We were able to land about $27
million in 90 days to build

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.450
out everything we've done so far.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.100
So, that's sort of the history
of how it all came about.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.000
&gt;&gt; Now, one of the reasons I'm here is
because you're such an innovative and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.560
extensive user of Direct.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.390
So, how did that come about?

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.880
&gt;&gt; We are a big believer of a
centralized model in that what model you

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.480
choose depends on what you're looking to
do in the future, what your goals are.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.760
For ours we wanted a very robust,
persistent database where

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.950
we could do research,
we could do quality improvement,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.275
population health, comparative public
reporting, lots of things with that.

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:43.388
But in 2004 we did a little survey and

00:02:43.388 --> 00:02:48.040
there were 60 plus different,
EHR platforms in our state and

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.880
we said, what are we going to
integrate with all 60 of these?

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.820
There's going to be 70 and
there's going to be 80 and

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.080
then we have to keep every
interface up and running.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.357
The cost of that was beyond our
reach and the time frame for

00:03:00.357 --> 00:03:03.640
doing that was beyond our comprehension,
we want to move fast here.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.240
So suddenly we were at a national
meeting when Direct was announced and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.060
then our Chief Operating Officer, Gary
Christianson, turned to me and said,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.150
point to point.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.840
He said what if one of those points is
in EHR and the other point is our HIE,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.700
Current Care?

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.280
Couldn't we use that to lift
a continuity of care document

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.710
out of those EHR's?

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.980
No interface required,
no upkeep required,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.610
no millions of dollars to
get our community connected.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.770
We were astonished at the simplicity of
that solution and it has worked for us.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.970
So we have platforms
in beta line of code.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.480
When a physician closes a record or

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.210
some other trigger that they've put into
their platform, we close the record,

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.130
it sends out an automatic API call
up to Direct messages formed.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.240
It attaches the current
continuity of care document,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.660
ships it up to current care.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.670
So it's all automated,
behind the scenes,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.610
no physician ever has to push a button,
to remember to do something.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.550
It's automated, so for us,
we were incredibly excited about it.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.700
&gt;&gt; So, I want the students to
focus on what Laura just said.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.550
I've talked repeatedly about the need
to integrate direct into workflow, and

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.650
you just heard an example of that.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.270
&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.
