00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.532
So we already know that we arrived at the contradiction. We checked that in the two quizzes, and we didn't

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:11.399
make any mistake here. One thing that could be wrong is that we just cannot run the program inverse halt on itself.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.732
But again, this is perfectly fine because inverse halt is a program, and because it's a program,

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:20.366
we also have its source codes. So we can easily feed this program to itself.

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:25.332
So let's go back one more step, step number three. The program inverse halt, how we wrote that--

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:32.432
Did we make any mistake here? Well, no, we didn't. We just used the algorithm halt, we gave it a valid input.

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:35.966
So we gave it a program to check, and we gave it also an input for that program.

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:41.399
Sometimes it might be confusing that the program is both an input and an actual program,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.299
but it's perfectly fine again, because the program here is the source code, so we can take it as both.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.966
The rest of the code is fully valid, so it's deterministic, there doesn't really go anything wrong here.

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:58.499
So this contradiction here cannot be due to step four, it can also not be due to step three.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.666
What about step two? Well, that there is an algorithm "halt" for the halting problem was a direct conclusion of assumption

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:16.566
number one. So there also cannot be something wrong with number two, unless of course number one in itself was wrong.

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:22.032
And since we checked two, three, and four, and there must be some sort of error in the proof,

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:28.432
the only place where this error can be is here in step number one. So what does step number one say?

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:33.399
Step number one assumed that the halting problem is in fact decideable.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.932
And since this logically leads us to contradiction, this assumption here must be false.

00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:42.666
So the halting problem cannot be decideable. It is in fact undecideable.

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:48.899
And that of course means that there's no algorithm that will tell you, for any given program, and any given input,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.766
if that program will ever stop. Now, the technique that we used here, at least if you're not used to it,

00:01:54.767 --> 00:02:01.799
can sometimes be a little bit confusing. I would therefore like to give you a second illustration of exactly this proof here,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.433
just to make sure that you understand it.
