00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Assertion also easily allowed you to put the blame on specific places.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Assume I have a function f with a pre and a post condition,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we call f and this precondition of f is satisfied.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now, f calls g and now, the precondition over here is violated and raises an exception.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Quiz question, who is at fault here? Is it f because it violates the precondition of g?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Is it g because it raises an exception? Or is it both f and g because they are incompatible?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Over to you.
