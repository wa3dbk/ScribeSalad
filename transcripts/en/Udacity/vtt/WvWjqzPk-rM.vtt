This question is not graded. I'm just interested in what you think of when you

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.208
hear this color's name. Ready? Chartreuse. What color does that word make you

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:12.102
think of? Don't worry about your answer. I got this one wrong too. I probably

00:00:12.102 --> 00:00:15.476
should have answered I don't know, which is a correct answer. But I thought I

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:16.509
did know.
