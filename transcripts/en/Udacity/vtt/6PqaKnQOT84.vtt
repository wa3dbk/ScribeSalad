00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.529
So, let's put all this together with a little quiz. What would the numerator

00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:09.208
would have been for 1/2 to be in 10ths? And also, I want you to write in your

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.988
own equivalent fraction for 1/2. You can write any fraction in this box. You

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.495
want to put our answer like 3 slash 4, or 3 divided by 4, 3/4. You can put your

00:00:18.507 --> 00:00:22.355
answer in as a number, a slash, and then another number, just make sure that

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:23.115
it's equal to 1/2.
