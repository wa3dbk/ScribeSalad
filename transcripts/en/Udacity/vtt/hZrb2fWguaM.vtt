Now, before we go any further, you should make sure your computer can run WebGL

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:09.446
programs. Gl stands for Graphics Library and it's what this course uses to teach

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:13.703
3D Graphics. Webgl is built into a number of web browsers so you don't need to

00:00:13.703 --> 00:00:17.740
install anything. Unfortunately there's one major exception, Internet Explorer.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.037
So, you'll need to use a different browser such as Chrome or Firefox. On Macs,

00:00:22.037 --> 00:00:26.215
Safari supports WebGL but you'll have to do a little twiddle to enable it. Linux

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:29.658
has it's own issues. You may also have problems with older graphics cards and

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:34.108
drivers. The easiest way to test and debug your computer is to visit the

00:00:34.108 --> 00:00:38.494
following url, get.webgl.org. If you see a simple rotating cube on the screen

00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:42.102
you're all set. If not follow the instructions on this webpage to get your

00:00:42.102 --> 00:00:45.520
computer properly set up. If one browser doesn't work for you try another. My

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.420
personal preference is Google's Chrome as it has a java script debugger built

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.725
in. If you get stuck, see the additional course materials for more tips and

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:58.242
suggestions. Ultimately, you have to get WebGL to work, in order to fully enjoy

00:00:58.242 --> 00:01:01.690
this course. Once you have it set up, you can go to a huge number of web pages

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.013
that have graphical demos running on them, like this one. Look at the links

00:01:05.013 --> 00:01:07.009
provided for some of the better programs out there.
