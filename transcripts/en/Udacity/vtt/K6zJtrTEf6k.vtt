00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.150
What we can see here, is that the debugger caught inside the plot-points

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.509
callback function, which gets called after our data gets loaded, that represents

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:15.186
our attendance data for all the games, and just as standard you check if we

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:20.351
use the console .table function, to display the first ten rows of our data set.

00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:23.670
We can see here that it looks the same even though some of

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.269
the columns are smushed.

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.862
But we have a game ID, attendance, team one, team two,

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:36.012
goals, tie and so forth, so it appears that our data's loaded correctly.

00:00:36.012 --> 00:00:39.548
Stepping once more through to the key function.

00:00:39.548 --> 00:00:41.529
If we inspect what D is,

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:46.879
we can see here that it's game ID one represents the first game,

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.845
Italy versus the US and so forth with all the other data of our first row.

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:57.725
If we call the getUTCFullYear function on our date object,

00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:01.834
we can see here that returns correctly 1934.

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:05.570
Stepping through to our roll up function,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.357
we can see here [NOISE] that leaves represents an array.

00:01:10.357 --> 00:01:16.502
And here we can see there is an array of 17 objects.

00:01:16.502 --> 00:01:21.332
If we inspect each of these, we can see that it is one game, in this case,

00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:23.647
from the tournament in 1934.

00:01:23.647 --> 00:01:28.430
The second one is another game from the year 1934.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.040
So what gets past the roll up,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.110
is one group at a time of the grouping specified in the key function.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.350
And it is the job of the roll up function to distill, in this case,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.390
the 17 object or games into a single value, or a single aggregate.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.130
Going back to our editor, to fix up our roll up aggregate function,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.900
we need three things from each of these groups.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.490
The first of which is the sum of all the games attendances for a given year,

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.400
the second is the longitude of where to draw the circle on our map,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.500
and the third is the latitude of where to draw this.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.600
To get the sum of the attendances, we'll be using the D3 sum method,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.520
which takes both sum array or list-like object, in our case,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.450
leaves, and an accessor function that defines what to actually sum.
