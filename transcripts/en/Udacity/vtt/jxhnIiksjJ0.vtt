00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.660
The first thing we have to do is actually test whether or not the boundaries of

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.507
this style intersect with the boundaries of the view rectangle. Now if you look

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:10.870
online you can actually find some really nice blocks of code that are 2D

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.859
rectangle to 2D rectangle testing. Effectively we're playing the same principle

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.353
here. We compute the boundaries of the x and y of the actual tile and world

00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:22.941
space. And test this against our view rectangle boundaries as well. If the tile

00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:27.430
lands outside of the viewRect, or it's not intersecting with the viewRect, then

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.580
it's not visible and we can move on. For those tiles that past this test, we

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.738
actually modify the worldX, and worldY translating it by the inverse of the

00:00:35.738 --> 00:00:39.362
viewRect off set. What this is going to do is it's going to take our viewRect

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:43.142
and actually recenter it on the canvas itself, so that the worldX and worldY

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:47.182
coordinates are actually canvas oriented rather than world oriented. These

00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:50.958
values are then passed down to canvas.drawimage directly and the image will

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.630
magically appear on the screen.
