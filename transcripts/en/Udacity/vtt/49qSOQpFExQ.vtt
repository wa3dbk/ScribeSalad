00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hi. I'm Peter Norvig. I'll be your instructor for CS212, Design of Computer Programs.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm assuming that you have some background.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You took CS101 or the equivalent elsewhere,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
so you understand the basics of statements, expressions, and data types

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in Python or some other language.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, what this class will be about is the design process:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
how to take what you already know and put them together in order to solve a problem.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We'll talk about some of the attributes of good programs--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
correctness, efficiency, generality and so on--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and we'll give you a process for thinking about design:

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
how to go from the uncertain stage of not knowing what the problem really is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and working your way all the way through to a good solution.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We'll also give you a set of tools that you can use along the way.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I had a lot of fun choosing the examples for this class and working them out,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and I think you'll have a lot of fun too,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and when you're done, you'll have a real sense of accomplishment.

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So I hope to see you in class.
