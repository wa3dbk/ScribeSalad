00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.160
Another important distinction, is that any file you put

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.420
in the cache, has to actually be downloadable. If

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.160
I put something in here that doesn't actually exist,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.370
and then try to update the cache again, you'll notice

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.650
that I get a resource fetch failed event. And

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.410
the problem is, this means that the cache is

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.300
not being updated. It doesn't just fail to cache

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.770
that one file. It doesn't update the cache at all.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.210
This is to make sure that sets of

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.770
resources can be managed together. But be sure to

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.020
watch the console log and make sure that

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.340
you're getting the right things. The important poitn here

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.630
is that the app cached contents are used

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.300
immediately, even when you're online. The design of Appcash

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.120
is offline first. The user gets content immediatly, rather

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.980
than having to wait for the network to respond.
