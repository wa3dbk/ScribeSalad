&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome. We have a solution. Actually, we have two solutions. We have two

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:07.027
different values of x, either of which would make this equation true. At any

00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:10.547
given time, we don't use both of them. As always when we're substituting in

00:00:10.547 --> 00:00:14.145
values for variables, we're consistent about what we plug in. If we're going

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:17.655
with x equals negative 30, we put that in every spot where x is. Let's just

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:21.014
double-check to make sure that this is what we want to have happen. The

00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:25.750
left-hand side of the equation, if we plug in x equals negative 30, will end up

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.357
being 0 times negative 35. Even though this factor over here is not 0, anything

00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:34.426
times 0 is 0. Something very similar happens if we plug in x equals 5, but I'll

00:00:34.426 --> 00:00:38.455
leave that up to you. And the question is, considering what x stands for,

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:42.877
remember, it's the length that we're adding to each side of Grant's booth, only

00:00:42.877 --> 00:00:47.436
one of these two answers really mean makes sense. Thinking about what x stands

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:52.311
for in our original equation, remember it's the length that Grant wants to add

00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:56.811
in feet to each side of his display booth at the expo, only one of these two

00:00:56.811 --> 00:01:01.612
answers really makes sense. So, pick one of them, and tell me how much longer

00:01:01.612 --> 00:01:03.715
each side of the booth should be.
