Another drug used to treat depression is Buprenorphine or Wellbutrin. And this

00:00:05.564 --> 00:00:10.773
is chemically unrelated to the tricyclics, the MAOIs, and the SSRIs. It

00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:14.337
inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine and dopemine which are associated with

00:00:14.337 --> 00:00:19.570
the arousal and positive mood. In addition, the drug is also marketed under the

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.870
name Zyban and it serves as a smoking cessation aid.
