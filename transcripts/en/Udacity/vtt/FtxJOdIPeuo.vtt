00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.001
So back in the book list demo I have my list of books to read and here I want

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:09.423
to replace the Eyre Affair with the SQL. When I want to replace an element I

00:00:09.423 --> 00:00:14.230
use the set method and the Eyre Affair is element zero. So now that reference

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.826
at element zero will be a reference to Lost in a Good Book instead of the Eyre

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:23.303
Affair and you can see this by running the method again. Now it starts with

00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:24.730
Lost in a Good Book.
