00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One way to do this is to go explicitly through all these 5 different cases from 0 to 4

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and multiply in manually the miss or hit case.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is not particularly elegant, but it does the job,

00:00:12.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and as I hit the "Run" button, we get the correct answer that is not normalized.
