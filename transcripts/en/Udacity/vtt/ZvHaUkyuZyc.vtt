00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.625
Let's have a quiz on this.

00:00:01.625 --> 00:00:04.917
If all memcpys and kernel launch operations in the below code snippets

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:07.571
take exactly 1 second to complete,

00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:10.644
what is the minimum time taken before the results are available on the host?

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:12.527
So here's the code snippets.

00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:15.739
We'll start by declaring a couple of cudaStreams, s1 and s2,

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:21.644
and by using the cudaStreamCreate call to create streams with those stream objects.

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:23.961
And then there's are a bunch of code snippets,

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:28.110
and I want you to tell me how long each one is going to take, in seconds.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.107
I've taken a couple of shortcuts here.

00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:35.215
I haven't showed you d array, h array, d array 1, h array 1, 2.

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:37.302
I haven't showed you these things getting allocated.

00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:40.770
You can assume that d_arr has been allocated with cudaMalloc

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.635
and it is a pointer to some device memory

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:50.010
and that h_arr has been allocated in pinned host memory using cudaHostMalloc.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.889
And for a shorthand, I just abbreviated CUDA host to device as H2D

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:57.771
and CUDA device to host as D2H.

00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:02.242
Notice that I'm launching a single block with a fairly small number of threads

00:01:02.242 --> 00:01:04.474
in each of these thread launches.

00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:07.175
So if all of these operations take 1 second,

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:11.248
what's the minimum time that each of them can take to complete?

00:01:11.248 --> 00:01:15.105
What's the minimum time that it will be before the final results are ready for the host?
