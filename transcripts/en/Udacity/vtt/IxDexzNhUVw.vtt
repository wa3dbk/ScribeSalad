00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.324
The angle between a vector and itself is 0 degrees. The dot product computes

00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:07.905
the cosine between 2 vectors, times the length of each vector involved. The

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:12.000
cosine of 0 degrees is 1, but the length of the vector is not necessarily 1, so

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.986
the dot product itself is not guaranteed to be 1. This statement is false. If

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:21.775
the vector was stated to be normalized, this statement would be true. If two

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:26.070
vectors are perpendicular, they are 90 degrees apart. The cosine of 90 degrees

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.084
is 0, so this statement is true. The cross product of two vectors computes the

00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:33.252
sine of the angle between the vectors, expressed as the length of the resulting

00:00:33.252 --> 00:00:37.958
vector. This sine can vary from negative 1 to 1, so the length of the resulting

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:42.076
vector can also vary in length. If the two normalized vectors are

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:46.390
perpendicular, the length is always 1, but not at any other angle. This

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.475
statement is false. The angle between the vector and itself is 0 degrees, so

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:55.016
the sine will be 0, meaning the resulting vector will always be length 0. This

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:55.860
statement is true.
