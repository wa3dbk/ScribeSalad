00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And the answer is a resounding 66-68 so this is the correct number.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now if you look at these ranges very carefully, they aren't all the same size it seems.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This seems to be more like 2 but this range seems to be just 1,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and the reason is these numbers are truncated.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They actually have decimal points that are not displayed

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but regardless, this category wins hands down in the statistic.
