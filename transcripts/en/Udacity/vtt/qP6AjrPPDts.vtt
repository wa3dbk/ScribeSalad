Other people change our behavior by way of things like obedience and

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:08.500
conformity. But they can also influence our perception, beliefs and attitudes.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.576
That's what social perception is. Social processes influence our behavior, but

00:00:12.576 --> 00:00:17.391
they can also influence our perception of other people's behavior. We often

00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:21.146
wonder why people do what they do. That is, we try to make sense of our social

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:23.490
world, and that is social perception.
