3 j s also has some built in support for object rotation. The call is like this,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.280
you can specify x y or z for the axis of rotation. The object will rotate around

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.250
it's center along that axis in a counter clock wise fashion. The angle is

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.200
specified in radians which computers like, as a human I like degrees. So here

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.640
I'm specifying 70 degrees then converting this number to radians by multiplying

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.032
by PI over 180. Here we can see the direction is counterclockwise if you were to

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:31.850
point the x axis toward you. A way to remember this direction is the right-hand

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.000
rule. Even though it looks clockwise in this figure, if you put your thumb along

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.032
the x axis and rotate around you'll see it's indeed following the right-hand

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:40.392
rule.
