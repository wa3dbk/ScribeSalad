We know our common denominator is 56. So I need to multiply 3 8ths by 7 over 7,

00:00:06.427 --> 00:00:12.698
and I get 21, 56. For 3 7ths, we're going to multiply by 8 over 8, and I'll get

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.212
24, 56. To add 21, 56 and 24, 56, I just count up how many 56 I have all

00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:23.690
together. I have 45, 56. So all together we walked 45 56 of a kilometer. Maybe

00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:28.639
you have another method for finding the least common denominator. If you do,

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.103
share it on the forum.
