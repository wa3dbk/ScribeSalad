00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. That just about wraps it up.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I hope you enjoyed the course.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We certainly enjoyed putting it together for you.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Before we sign off, I want do to a few thank yous.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I want to thank Sebastian Thrun for inviting me to do the course

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and for giving me this opportunity.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I want to thank the smart and energetic staff at Udacity who provided

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
support of various kinds in creating and delivering the course.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And I'll single out Katie, Kathleen, Clark, Calvin, and Grant.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Grant, I guess, couldn't manage to get a K on the front of his name. We'll call him Krant.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
All of whom were just a delight to work with.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Thanks also to Mor Naaman, a professor at Rutgers,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
who gave me some hints about how to gather social network data,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and of course the experts who participated in my interviews,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Andrew Goldberg, Vukosi Marivate, Duncan Watts, Peter Winkler, and Tina Eliassi-Rad.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
They graciously shared their time and their knowledge in their interviews.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
A big thanks to Eliot Escher, who gave me feedback on my vocal performance

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in the song and also contributed her own beautiful voice to the music video.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You can probably figure out which one was her.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I want to thank David Evans at Udacity for providing very detailed feedback

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
on my lecture notes to make this as Udacity-ish as possible,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
even though this was my very first time.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I want to thank my family for putting up with this extra drain on my time,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and finally, thanks to the class T.A. Job Evers,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
who made the course happen day after day.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So, good luck to all of you on the final.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's been a great experience for me, and I hope to see you around.
