If you said 5, way to go. First, I'm going to add 4 y to both sides. So, I'll

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.372
have 0 here, 10, 19 y, and negative 85, with my equal sign in the middle. The

00:00:10.384 --> 00:00:15.192
left is equal to the right. Adding down, I get 95 is equal to 19 y. And,

00:00:15.308 --> 00:00:20.798
negative 85 and 85 make 0. And for the last step, I divide both sides by 19, the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.768
coefficient of my variable. This seems like really tough multiplication. But,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.152
let's take a second and stop and think about it. Let's try not using a

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:38.106
calculator for this. I know 20 times 5 is 100. Here, I have it 19 times y. Well,

00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:43.804
19 is 1 short of 20. So, I would be 5 short of 100. Hey, look at that. I'm 5

00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:49.790
short of 100. So, 19 times 5 must be 95. So, this y has to be 5.
