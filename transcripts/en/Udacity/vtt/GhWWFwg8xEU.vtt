00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.320
In this app, we see an example, 
of a defragmented network traffic

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.210
that uses the big cookie model.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.160
All the repeating transfers
have been bundled together,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.720
and all the intermittent transfers
have been largely replaced

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.730
with aggressive prefetching.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.310
Obviously, you usually can't entirely
predict what data users might need.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.250
Nor can you ignore either client
or service site changes

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.750
that need to be synchronized.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.460
You can aim to minimize the number
of radio state transitions

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.810
through a combination
of aggressive prefetching

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.720
in addition to batching and queueing 
any transfers that aren't time critical

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.480
and bundling these with
user initiated time critical transfers,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.620
or those initiated from the server.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.900
If we compare the impact 
on the radio of the big cookie model

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.160
compared to the previous
on demand approach,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.770
you can see it's now idle 
nearly two thirds of the time.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.530
Even the active radio percentage 
has significantly dropped,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.573
thanks to improved download efficiency
as a result of transmitting

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:54.710
more data in one shot.
