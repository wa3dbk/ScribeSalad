00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.960
So, Product Hunt has been blowing up.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.140
What do you think made them so
successful?

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.210
&gt;&gt; So, Product Hunt is an interesting
story because my contributing author

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.630
on the book is a guy by
the name of Ryan Hoover,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.740
who was working a job at
a startup that he was okay with.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.892
He wasn't super happy about.

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:20.486
But Ryan emailed me one day and said,
hey, I've been reading your articles on

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:23.910
TechCrunch, and
I like this consumer psychology stuff.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.240
How can I help you?

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.720
So we got together for
lunch one day, and I said, look,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.720
I've got all these articles.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.310
I've been thinking about putting
them together in a book.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.930
Do you think you could kind of help
me make them into this cohesive book,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.070
as opposed to a bunch
disparate articles?

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.150
And he did.
We worked on it for several months, and

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.160
he did a fantastic job.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.700
I really enjoyed working with him.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.330
Well, there's nobody who understand
the hook model second to me

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.880
better than Ryan.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.610
And the next thing that Ryan did
after we worked on this book

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.090
was to start Product Hunt.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.060
And he designed Product Hunt from
the get-go with the hook model in mind.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.080
Now the company is doing
phenomenally well.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.400
I'm lucky enough to be an investor.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.580
So full disclosure, I happen to
be a fan for a number of reasons.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.670
But, yeah, the app is doing incredibly
well because it was designed with this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.050
hook at the early days
of the product design.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.940
And of course, Ryan and his team
get 110% of the credit for this.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.810
I have the easy part of just
talking about the theory,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.110
but they had to actually implement it.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.560
But I think they saved
themselves a lot of time and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.910
found the right thing
sooner by using the model.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.162
&gt;&gt; And now I as a new
entrepreneur can do the same?

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:30.755
&gt;&gt; Right, so again,
I am a little biased here.

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:34.220
But I think it starts by taking
some time to figure out your hook.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.320
Before you've laid down any code,
before you've done any wire frames, just

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.740
to think about what the core experience
is that you want to turn into a habit.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.950
And then ask yourself, do you have the
fundamental characteristics of a habit

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.530
forming technology, by number one, have
you identified the internal trigger?

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.330
Do you know your users' itch?

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.900
Number two,
what's the external trigger that

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.700
gives the user some piece of
information to do the intended action?

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.567
Number three,
what's the intended behavior, and

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:04.791
how can it be made as
simple as possible?

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.815
Number four, the variable reward is how
are you giving the user what they want,

00:02:08.815 --> 00:02:12.330
scratching their itch, and yet
leaving them wanting more.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.400
And then finally, the investment phase,
the fifth question,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.560
is what's the bit of work that the user
does to prompt the next action,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.310
to load the next trigger, and
to store value in the product.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.922
And if you can answer
those five questions, and

00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:28.591
you have this core hook in your mind,
you can design accordingly.

00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:32.190
And it becomes much easier to
build the right thing sooner.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.560
&gt;&gt; Can I use the same model
on existing products?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.720
&gt;&gt; Sure.
So,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.690
it's a little bit more
difficult because as you know,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.800
once you've built a product,
it's kind of hard to change it, right?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.220
You've done all the architecting.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.130
People have worked
hundreds of hours on it.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.130
It's harder to change and so,
what oftentimes I see people doing is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.810
I'll get emails from an entrepreneur or
a product manager.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.865
And they'll say to me look, we've been
struggling with this product, and

00:02:56.865 --> 00:03:00.080
until we read your book, we couldn't
figure out why people weren't using it.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.304
Right, we put so
much effort into building it, and

00:03:02.304 --> 00:03:04.050
we didn't know what was going on.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.450
A few customers were telling
us they really liked it,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.180
but even they weren't using it.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.720
So then the book can become a diagnostic
tool where you can figure out oh,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.040
this is why people aren't coming back.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.870
We haven't identified
the right internal trigger.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.440
The external trigger isn't effective.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.240
The action is too difficult.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.880
The reward isn't very rewarding.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.170
Or we're not asking people for
the investment at the right time.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.570
So then it becomes a diagnostic tool,
and

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.410
then you can of course
correct from there.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.753
&gt;&gt; So what hooks does Product Hunt have?

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:36.150
&gt;&gt; Sure, so
I think Product Hunt has a great hook.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.070
It's something that people
use on a daily basis.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.200
I think their hook is very reliant
on this external trigger of

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.180
getting an email.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.760
So you get this daily email from
Product Hunt that says hey,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.260
here's the latest and
greatest in technology products.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.770
The action then is to open the email and
to reveal the variable reward.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.380
Now, the variable reward is this
uncertainty about, well what is it?

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.040
What is the latest and greatest, right?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.610
You're looking through all these various
products to see one that might be

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.680
interesting to you.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.957
You click on one of those products.

00:04:04.957 --> 00:04:08.421
If you go to the Product Hunt discussion
page, there's all these discussions

00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:11.530
happening about people talking with
the founders of these products.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.040
There's this great community
formed around these products.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.430
And the more you interact with
that community by commenting,

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.779
by sharing things to that community,
by creating collections,

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.810
all of these things load
the next trigger and store value.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.378
So the next time it won't be
your daily digest anymore.

00:04:28.378 --> 00:04:32.188
Now it'll be an email from oh, this is
your friend who you trust, who just

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:36.130
posted something to Product Hunt
prompting you to come back again, right?

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.930
That's a piece of information
that you've given the company

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.390
that can now send you through that
four steps of the hook once again.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.797
The more you use the product, and
this is where I think investors think

00:04:45.797 --> 00:04:48.224
the company can grow
outside of just technology,

00:04:48.224 --> 00:04:49.750
is that it learns your tastes.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.051
It learns what you're into.

00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:55.691
And so hopefully over time that hook
expands into all different kinds

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:57.934
of interesting industry areas.

00:04:57.934 --> 00:05:01.330
&gt;&gt; So understanding me and
giving me more relevant results.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.010
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.820
That's part of this investment phase.
