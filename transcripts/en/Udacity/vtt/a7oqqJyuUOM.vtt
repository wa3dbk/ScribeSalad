00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.810
But take a look at how this changes our diagram.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.280
In the old version, we had only one function object because it

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.280
had been defined outside of the carlike function.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.040
Now, as a result of the fact that we moved the source code for

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.340
that move method up into the body of the carlike function, we now

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.520
have a new function being generated every time we run the carlike function.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.180
This is a high price to pay for the simplicity of having all of your code show

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.290
up at the same level of indentation inside the body of the carlike function.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.840
People are often confused why it would be the case that moving the function

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.570
definition up into the body of this function would result in there being many

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.190
move methods, many different function objects, one per instance of a car.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.600
Let's open a new file to examine that point.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.030
This simple maker function builds and returns a brand new object.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.450
So after calling makeAnObject twice and

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.870
storing each of the results in a variable, do you expect the two objects that

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.140
are stored in these two variables to be the exact same or to be two objects that

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.020
look quite similar because of the similarities in their properties.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.830
Another way of asking this is would they pass a strict comparison of

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.660
their identity using triple equals?
