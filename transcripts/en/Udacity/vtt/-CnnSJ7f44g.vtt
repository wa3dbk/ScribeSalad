00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want you to write a function called test that accepts as input a sample l

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and hypothesis h and it returns true if we believe the null hypothesis in a two-sided test.

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Otherwise, it returns false. Insert your code right here.
