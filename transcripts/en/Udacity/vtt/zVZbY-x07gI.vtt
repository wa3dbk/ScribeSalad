00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.380
So, imagine that you were a programmer implementing the internal logic of

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.750
the clock radio. You would have to take into account all of the different

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.750
events, okay? And all of the possible combinations of those events.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.360
So, ultimately, you have to deal with all those cases. And consequently,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.410
it makes sense during the analysis phase, to list them all, okay?

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.180
To give a fairly precise description of what are all the different events.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.015
What information comes in along you know,

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:33.700
its parameters to those events. And ultimately then, what the system,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.020
how the system's going to respond to those events. And for the purposes of this

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.320
exercise, I've expressed that in a table in which we have numbered events, and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.930
we have the the description of the event, and then the systems response to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.210
that event. So, listed here at the beginning of that table
