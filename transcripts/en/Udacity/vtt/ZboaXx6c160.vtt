00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.713
But sometimes factoring by grouping isn't so straightforward. Let's consider an

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:08.667
expression like this. Notice that in these first two group of terms I have a

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:12.987
greatest common factor of one. The same is true in these second two terms. So I

00:00:12.987 --> 00:00:17.448
need to do something else. So we can switch the order of the terms. So you try

00:00:17.448 --> 00:00:21.164
this one. Regroup the terms and then try factoring by grouping.
