00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:04.728
The final algorithm we'll discuss, which we're going to call sort, then reduce by key,

00:00:04.728 --> 00:00:08.978
is one that I'll just sketch out, primarily because we haven't discussed the underlying algorithms yet.

00:00:08.978 --> 00:00:10.647
We'll get to them in the next lecture.

00:00:10.647 --> 00:00:14.733
However, it'll be a great mental exercise for you to think about how you might implement this approach.

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:20.623
Let's think about our entries. Here we have 8 entries, as key-value pairs.

00:00:20.623 --> 00:00:26.031
The key is the bin number, and in this example we're going to have 3 bins--0, 1 and 2.

00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:29.953
And the value is 1, which we're going to add to each bin.

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:34.517
This algorithm has 2 steps. The first is a sort, the second is a reduce.

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:39.458
So first, let's look at the sort. We're going to sort the key value pairs by key.

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:42.861
So here's our keys, and notice it's the same key value pairs that

00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:46.183
we have up here, but now they're in ascending order by key.

00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:49.818
And the second step is to reduce the result by key.

00:00:49.818 --> 00:00:52.788
Naturally enough, this algorithm is called reduce by key.

00:00:52.788 --> 00:00:55.621
What I mean here is to add all the elements that have the key together.

00:00:55.621 --> 00:01:00.415
So, we'd like to add these four 1's up to create the reduction value of 4,

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:04.566
or, more generally, to reduce these values using reduction operator.

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.799
Note that all elements with the same key are contiguous,

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.619
which is the key to making an efficient implementation.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.127
Now again, this is likely not something you can do with the algorithms that you know so far.

00:01:15.127 --> 00:01:19.416
But libraries of parallel primitives may have implementations for both of these operations.

00:01:19.416 --> 00:01:22.931
For instance, the thrust library that accompanies acuda distribution implements

00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:25.400
both sort and reduce by key methods.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.400
Thinking about how you might implement these 2 operations is worth your time over the next week.
