00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.900
Just stepping through this diagram,
okay?

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.880
We start off with some
underlying distribution,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.550
pardon my inability to trace, okay?

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.730
But, of course, we don't actually
have a real distribution.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.750
What we have is a set of particles,
okay?

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.100
Those particles are not
uniformly weighted, remember?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.160
The sum of all the weights is one, some
particles have more weight than others.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.320
That is, they,
that particle has a higher probability.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.160
All right?

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.070
So here's what we do.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.140
The first thing we do is we draw
a set of samples from this set, okay?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.670
Now, you'll notice here, in this nice
picture, one of my big particles happen

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.210
to gets, to get sampled three times,
the medium particles got sampled twice.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.450
And the this one got sampled once.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.160
And by the way,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.420
notice, how many times that these
itty-bitty particles get sampled?

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.930
Not at all.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.050
That's okay, because you're doing a
random sample because it corresponds to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.310
the density, and that random sampling
sometimes gets all the particles,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.090
sometimes only gets the ones
with significant weights.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.000
So, we do the sampling.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.120
Now, the next thing you'll see is that
each one of these particles has been

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.400
shifted, but you'll notice that
the shifts are not always the same.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.440
So, why do you think that is?

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.450
Do you know why that is?

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.560
&gt;&gt; There's a deterministic part,
nothing says that my deterministic

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.100
part has to be the same for all my
guesses of the previous state, okay?

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.890
Let's suppose what I do is I take a step

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.752
proportional to the number of lines
that are on the floor, right?

00:01:34.752 --> 00:01:37.170
So I'm going to step three lines.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.220
But if the lines are closer
here than they were over here.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.440
Relax, Megan.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.360
Then going three step, three lines over
here would actually mean I'd moved

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.760
a smaller amount than
if I was over here.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.020
If I had gone three lines,
I would have gone a further amount.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.570
All this means is that
the deterministic part

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.740
doesn't have to be the same everywhere.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.440
It's just deterministic.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.870
Then, we add in essentially what could
be thought of as the diffusion part or

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.270
the uncertainty part.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.330
Remember when we were
generating the new sample,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.880
we did the deterministic part,
plus the probabilistic part.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.050
And that's what's here, right?

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.180
So, after we take a sample and
we move it, we add some noise.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.750
And we do that every time
we have drawn a sample.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.450
So since we did three
samples from this particle,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.500
it ended up at three different places.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.769
Likewise for all the others.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.510
Then what we do is we
take our measurement, and

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.480
we've got p of z given x.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.710
That's what this value is.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.510
And we just multiply these weights,

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.160
which are all 1 to start with,
by that value, okay?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.670
Oh, here it is.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.350
p of z given X.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.070
We just multiply it, and we end up
with this new set of particles, okay?

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.660
So if I erase my, my figures there you
take a look, that's a beautiful figure.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.370
It's all of particle filtering.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.040
Just sleep with it under your pillow and
you'll be in, in great shape.
