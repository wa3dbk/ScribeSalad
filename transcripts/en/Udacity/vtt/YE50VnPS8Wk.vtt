What would be the most ethical way to study the effects of cocaine with

00:00:06.108 --> 00:00:12.520
pregnant women? Randomly assign pregnant women to either an experimental or

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.230
control group and give cocaine to those in the experimental group. And measure

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.160
the effects on the babies? Find women who used cocaine while they were pregnant

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.880
and study their babies. Or give cocaine to babies and then measure its effects.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.010

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.440
