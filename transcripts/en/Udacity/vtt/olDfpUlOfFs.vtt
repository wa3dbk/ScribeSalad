00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.180
You may remember this from the last lecture where we

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.890
talked basically using a lens and tracing rays of light through a lens and

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.820
see how an object is then created on the image or

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.020
a sensor, and that's how we go from a 3D scene to create images.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.550
Here I'm starting with a simple object and let's see by just doing simple ray

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.210
tracing what happens to this, a ray of light goes through the lens, and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.590
of course, goes through the focal length here and it's now on this side,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.770
another ray of light that goes through the optical center of the lens,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.640
which actually acts, if you recall, like a, pinhole, goes straight through,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.030
and similarly, another light comes on, and now basically, we're seeing that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.220
an image should be formed here, of course the image is upside down.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.670
I'd also introduced in the last lecture the whole concept of a thin lens

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.710
equation which is shown here, which basically relates the focal length of

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.620
an image with respect to what the distance is of the image,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.310
on this side of the lens, where the object is on the other side.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.970
Couple of things to clarify also and

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.490
point out here, this lens is a thin concave lens, which is the shape like this,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.010
it's also sometimes referred to as a positive lens, because all rays of

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.350
light converge, inside, to allow it to create an image on this side.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.620
Of course, convex lenses that have shapes like this are also used,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.340
sometimes they're referred to as negative lenses, and most of the time,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.460
when you buy an expensive lens for a camera,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.380
it's a combination of a series of these types of concave, convex lenses,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.450
that move together to create an effective lens that's used to be able to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.230
allow you, to take the, you know, rays of light from a scene onto your sensor.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.990
And we will be seeing some examples of this,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.700
but there's a lot of material that you can look up on your own to kind of

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.610
study the importance of these types of lenses.
