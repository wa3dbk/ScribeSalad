00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.182
Here's our coding solution 
for the share action provider.

00:00:03.422 --> 00:00:05.270
let's start by adding a string.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.213
The string will be used 
for the label for our action.

00:00:11.513 --> 00:00:13.976
Now we're going to add 
a new menu resource.

00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:16.340
This resource will be 
for the detail fragment.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.040
We'll start by adding the name space used

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.650
by the Android support library 
for its widget XML.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.530
Finally, we add the actual item.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.920
This menu item contains 
the string that we just added

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.860
from the strings file. 
It's always shown as an action,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.840
so it appears on the action bar.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.499
And its actionProviderClass
is the ShareActionProvider

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:41.050
from the Android support library. 
The Android support library

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.270
allows the ShareActionProvider
to be used on earlier versions

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.130
of Android, then 4.0,
when it was officially added

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.780
to the framework. 
Next, let's go to the DetailActivity.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.434
We're going to be looking 
at the DetailFragment

00:00:54.434 --> 00:00:58.030
within the DetailActivity. 
So the first thing we can do

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.810
in our fragment is 
to add a few useful things.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.830
Let's add a log tag, 
a string for the share hashtag,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.840
#SunshineApp, 
and we're going to take

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.160
the forecast string 
and make it a member variable.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.170
Next, in onCreate view, let's actually 
populate our member variable.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.490
And then finally, use it to set the text.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.150
let's create a share intent. 
This intent uses ACTION_SEND.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.680
This FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEARED_
WHEN_TASK_RESET is somewhat important.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.750
It prevents the activity 
we're sharing to from being

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.820
placed onto the activity stack. 
What will happen,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.770
if we don't have this flag, 
is when you click on the icon

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.610
to return to the application later,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.550
you may actually end up 
in another application,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.060
the one that's actually 
handling the share intent.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.050
When FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_WHEN_TASK RESET 
is used, it'll actually return you

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.080
to your application instead. 
We've set the type, test/plain,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.870
to let Android know we're going 
to be sharing plain text.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.840
And then we share 
our forecast string, plus our hashtag.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.070
Only one more thing left to do.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.380
We have to add the menu 
to the fragment.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.470
To do this, we have to set 
a flag that this fragment

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.660
has an options menu at all. 
Otherwise, it won't actually call

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.710
the onCreate options menu member function.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.730
Finally, here's our onCreate 
options member function.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.705
As you can see, we're inflating 
the detailfragment menu

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:22.176
that we created earlier. 
Finding the share item,

00:02:22.546 --> 00:02:26.434
getting the ShareActionProvider, 
and attaching our intent

00:02:26.434 --> 00:02:29.520
to this ShareActionProvider. 
You'll want to update this

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.970
whenever the data 
you want to share changes.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.610
And that's it.

00:02:33.645 --> 00:02:36.715
You've now added 
a ShareActionProvider into Sunshine.
