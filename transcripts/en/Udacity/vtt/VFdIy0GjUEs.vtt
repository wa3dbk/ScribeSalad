00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.800
Before we go any further, I need to

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.110
jump in here. Catherine has already said that

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.410
the refresh button is for debugging only, but

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.600
let's look at why. In real life, you

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.720
should always seek to eliminate the refresh button

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.970
from your app. A good app should work

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.560
like a good butler, giving you what you want before you even have to ask for

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.860
it.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.720
Much like the Save button, it's a relic of a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.370
bygone age. That's the best a reassuring safety blanket for those

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.370
of us who grew up with floppy disks. With the ability

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.670
to run background tasks or send messages directly from the server

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.860
to our app, there's really no reason to force users

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.960
to manually hit refresh. But the app is up to date

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.300
and sync with the cloud should be a given. But like

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.230
we said, this is for debugging, so like print line it's

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.370
acceptable for this particular purpose. Let's also take a look at

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.650
our background threading model, which of the following is potential an issue?
