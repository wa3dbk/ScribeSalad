00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.624
So here's the answer. We had to make two changes. The first was defining a new

00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:08.044
class and we defined a class called about, it provides a get method and all it's

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:12.418
get method does is return the strain, this my udacious project. We also had to

00:00:12.418 --> 00:00:16.848
change the way we construct the web application and we added a new tuple. Here

00:00:16.848 --> 00:00:21.528
the regular expression 'dMatches just one string, the string slash about and

00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:26.280
it's associated with that about class and will call the get method when there's

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.550
a request to get about. The rest is the same, if this doesn't match, we'll try

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.580
to match this next pattern which will match any other request and use lucky

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.474
search. Note that the order of these things does matter. If we had them in

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:42.244
reverse order, we'd never see the about page, because about would still match

00:00:42.244 --> 00:00:45.840
this regular expression, and would use the lucky search get method before

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.983
getting to about. That's why we need you to have about first.
