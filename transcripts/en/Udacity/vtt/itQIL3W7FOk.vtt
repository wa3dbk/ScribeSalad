00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.732
Here are the answers. So, if we add two ints, we get an int as the result. If we

00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:09.096
add an int and a float, we get a float as the result. This is the case even

00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:13.432
though it's the int plus operator that's being used. If we add two strings,

00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:18.042
well, that's string concatenation, we get a string as the result. If we add a

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:22.202
string with an int, well, that's trying to concatenate a string with a number,

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:26.430
which doesn't make sense, and that's why we get an error. If we have two lists,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.912
well, that pastes the lists together. That's list concatenation, and the result

00:00:30.912 --> 00:00:34.497
is a list. And finally, if there are two dictionaries, that's not defined.

00:00:34.498 --> 00:00:37.903
There's no plus operation on dictionaries, and we get an error.
