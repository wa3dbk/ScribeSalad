00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.230
In this class we'll use five main learning strategies. First, Learning by

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.970
Example. Almost every lesson of this class starts with an example of the type of

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.049
reasoning we want you to learn. The example that runs throughout the lesson,

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.180
could demonstrate that reasoning. Second, Learning by Doing. In most lessons,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.390
the lesson will end with a multi-part exercise, where you are doing the exact

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.070
reasoning that you learned in that lesson. There's first you see an example,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.860
then you do a similar example yourself. Third, Project-Based Learning.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.047
The class is largely structured around a series of challenging projects. And

00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:41.906
you will frequently be asked to relate each lesson you learn, to the projects in

00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:46.237
the class. Personalized learning. Personalization permeates throughout this

00:00:46.237 --> 00:00:50.990
course. You can watch the lessons in any order you choose, and at your own pace.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.680
You can choose which concepts to focus on, and everything the assignments.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.030
You'll receive personal feedback on every exercise throughout the course.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.882
Fifth, Learning by Reflection. At the conclusion of each lesson,

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:07.060
you'll be asked to reflect on what you learned in that particular lesson.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.520
At the conclusion of each project, you'll write a designed report that will

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.420
reflect on the experiments that you did as part of the project. We'll also use

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.160
other learning strategies as needed, such as collaborative learning.
