00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.820
Now if you've been actively thinking about how threads work so far

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.370
in this lesson, you may be wondering how does the memory for a

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.500
thread get cleaned up after it is finished, or where does its return

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.230
value go, or how can I make sure the thread has finished its

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.170
work before I let the main thread terminate? We'll answer all these

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.670
questions by looking at the distinction

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.610
between joinable and detached threads. Let's start

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.940
by talking about what makes a thread terminate. We'll draw the main thread

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.650
here on the left, our thread here on the right. And maybe there

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.530
are some other threads in between. There are really

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.700
two cases. First, the entire process will terminate if

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.220
any thread makes a call to exit or if main reaches the end of its code, it's or

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.250
executes a return statement. Again this will kill all

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.610
threads associated with the process. The second way our

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.405
thread might terminate, is if he himself calls either

00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:50.340
pthread-exit or executes a return statement. The distinction between

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.250
joinable and and detached threads is important for the second case

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.580
here. A thread can either be created in a detached state, or

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.870
detached later with the procedure call. When the detached thread reaches

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.360
the end of its execution, its memory is cleaned up right away,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.460
and any return value just disappears. At least, no other thread

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.200
has a way of getting at it. Moreover, we have to be

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.130
careful that main doesn't reach the end of its execution, and

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.460
execute a return statement, before the thread is done with its work.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.830
As seen in point 1, if main returns, then

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.920
the whole process terminates. So if we want to keep

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.780
this detached thread going, we have to terminate main

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.910
with a special call to pthread exit. Joinable threads, y

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.080
contrast, don't get destroyed right away when they finish.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.990
Instead, they stick around until another thread joins them. This

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.130
other thread makes a call to thread join, specifying

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.750
the thread. And also an address where the return value

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.560
of the joinable thread will get stored. This call blocks,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.550
until the joinable thread is finished. Though it's okay too

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.560
if it's finished already. So it's okay for the joined

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.320
call to be made first. Before the join thread is

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.990
finished. Having main join with other threads is a common

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.190
way to make sure that main doesn't finish before the

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.190
other threads, and kill them all via exit method one.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.900
By default, threads are joinable in the p threads library.
