00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.370
Here the only value that makes those statements true is positive one. That's

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.826
amazing work if you got this one correct. It was tough. First, we'll square

00:00:08.826 --> 00:00:13.662
both sides of the equation to get 4x squared plus 4x plus 1 equaled to 5x plus

00:00:13.662 --> 00:00:18.292
4. Next we want to get a quadratic on one side of the equation, and the other

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:23.560
side equal to zero. So we can subtract 5x from both sides, and subtract 4 from

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.975
both sides. We'll have 0 on the right and this quadratic on the left. Next, we

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:36.452
use factoring by grouping to get 4x plus 3 times x minus 1 equals 0. Once we

00:00:36.452 --> 00:00:42.960
have our factors of 4x plus 3 and x minus 1, we set each of those equal to 0.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.940
Then, we can solve for x, so x equals negative 3 4ths. Or x equals positive 1.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.807
And like all of our radical equations from before, we need to check each of

00:00:51.807 --> 00:00:56.895
these solutions in the original equation. When I plug in x equals 1, I get 3

00:00:56.895 --> 00:01:03.582
equals 3. So, yes, this will be part of our solution set. For x equals negative

00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:08.150
3 4's, we wind up with a solution that doesn't check. We know 2 times negative

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.542
3 4ths is negative 3 half, since we can cancel the common factor of 2, in the

00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:18.786
numerator and denominator. Here we'll just multiply 5 times negative 3 4ths to

00:01:18.786 --> 00:01:23.376
get negative 15 4ths. We change 4 into 16 4ths so we can add these two

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:28.905
fractions together. This gives us a positive 1 4th underneath our radical. W

00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:33.065
stake the radical of the numerator and the denominator to get 1 half since the

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:38.613
square root of 1 is 1 and the square root of 4 is 2. On the left side I changed

00:01:38.613 --> 00:01:44.788
tho simperer fraction to a mice dumber. Negative 1 and 1 half. We know negative

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:49.718
1 and positive 1 sum to 0, so we're left with negative 1 half. These two

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:54.138
statements are not true, so we cannot include this as part of our solution set,

00:01:54.138 --> 00:01:59.523
it's out. This is why our solution set is only positive 1.
