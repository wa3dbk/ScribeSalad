00:00:00.518 --> 00:00:03.770
As our applications become more
elaborate, you may find yourself

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.240
needing to overload functions or
return tuples instead of a single value.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.560
Using these special cases of
functions at the right time and

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.260
place will make for
more elegant solutions.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.400
Also, motifs like passing
a copy versus a reference

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.991
will show up again when we look more
deeply into objects and structs.
