00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.354
So let's start off really simple. Let's try creating a table to help us out. If

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:08.561
I started with two dimes, then I'd have to have three quarters. For ever two

00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:13.367
dimes there's three quarters, so five coins in total. If I add two more dimes,

00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:17.502
then I have to add three more quarters. So I'd get ten coins in total. The

00:00:17.514 --> 00:00:21.817
ration is a way of representing this constant increase. For every increase of

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.836
two in dimes I increase, and three in quarters. I could also have 6 dimes and 9

00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:31.331
quarters, which is 15 coins in total. But I don't know which case I'm in. I

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:36.203
could have had any number of coins. So, it's actually impossible to know. And in

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:41.083
fact, I had 10 coins in my hand. For every two dimes, I have three quarters. Two

00:00:41.095 --> 00:00:45.762
more dimes, three more quarters. This ratio is constant. I know that last

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:50.371
question wasn't obvious, so don't worry if you didn't get it right. I just

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.823
wanted to get you thinking about ratios.
