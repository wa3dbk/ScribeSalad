00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.250
The Trim method is another useful method from the string class. What if we have

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.600
a String messyString that looks like this, and then we run messystring.trim?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.440
What's the return value of messystring.trim? You should go to the API

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.490
documentation and read it and try to answer, using that.
