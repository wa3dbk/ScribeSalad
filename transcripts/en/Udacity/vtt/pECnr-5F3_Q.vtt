00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.564
Why did we not figure out earlier
that t-models were effective?

00:00:04.564 --> 00:00:08.310
Many reasons, but mostly because
t-models only really shine if you

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.680
have enough data to train them.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.610
It's only in recent years that large
enough data sets have made their way to

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.360
the academic world.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.260
We'll look at another reason now,
we know better today how to train very,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.080
very big models using better
regularization techniques.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.300
There is a general issue when you're
doing numerical optimization which I

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.530
call the skinny jeans problem.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.820
Skinny jeans look great,
they fit perfectly, but they're really,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.490
really hard to get into.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.200
So most people end up wearing
jeans that are just a bit too big.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.450
It's exactly the same
with deep networks.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.760
The network that's just the right
size for your data is very,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.880
very hard to optimize.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.300
So in practice, we always try networks
that are way too big for our data and

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.920
then we try our best to
prevent them from overfitting.
