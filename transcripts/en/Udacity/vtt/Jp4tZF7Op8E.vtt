00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.960
Let's discuss Key Based Routing. First, we'll talk

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.620
about the greedy approach. What I'm showing you here

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.932
is the state of the routing table at

00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:13.820
the source node, which is fourteen. And the key

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.200
that I'm looking for, let's say is four,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.070
and therefore in the greedy approach, I would assume

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.740
that The key K, that is K being four, will be stored at a destination whose node

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.170
ID is four. And what this table is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.720
showing, is the routing table at the source, and

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.770
in particular, the entry that you have here,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.170
where you have a valid entry, those are the

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.800
nodes that are reachable from. Node fourteen. So

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.760
from the source node fourteen I know how to

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.550
reach node number thirteen, I know how to

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.010
reach node number three, I know how to reach

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.510
node number two, zero and five. I don't know yet how to reach node number four

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.220
because that is not in my routing table at this point of time. The intuition

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.230
in the greedy approach is if I'm looking for a particular key, K, in this case,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:15.980
K is 4, then I know that the node that is likely to have that key,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.780
K, in this case 4, is going to be the node whose ID is also 4 and so this

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.510
is my desired destination, but what I'm going to do

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.250
in the greedy approach is get as close to the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.290
desired destination in the node_id namespace. If I look at

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.550
the state of my routing table, I don't know how

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.080
to get to 4, which is my desired destination, but

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.430
I know how to get to 5 which is close

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.650
to The desired destination in the name space of the

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.030
node ID's, so what I am going to do, is

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.650
ask this guy, because I know how to reach him,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.710
and he is close to my desired destination, do you

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.140
have a way of getting to destination number 4? And

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.740
my hope is that he may know the route to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.880
get me to the desired destination, and I'll be done.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.320
And getting the key value pair that I'm looking for.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.230
That's the idea in greedy routing. Take the minimum number of hops to get to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.620
the desired destination by using information that

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.060
is available in my user level routing table,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.070
that has information about which are the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.220
nodes that are reachable from me directly. So

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.550
the objective in the greedy approach to routing

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.340
is reaching the destination with the fewest number

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.270
of hops. That's the key. So in other words I am optimizing my own look up. This

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.340
"me first" approach we know can lead to congestion

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.940
and particularly the tree saturation that I mentioned earlier.
