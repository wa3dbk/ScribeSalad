00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.200
How can we check if all the images
on a site have been optimized?

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.280
Remember that in order to serve
the smallest possible image file on your

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.840
site, you need to make sure you've run
images through optimization tools.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.129
Now, one great tool for
checking this is PageSpeed Insights.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.880
Let's use that to check
a page from our website.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.140
One image that needs some help.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.190
We can also use PageSpeed Insights
from the dev tools.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.680
Just click Analyze.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.210
Best of all, there's
a PageSpeed Insights API that let's you

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.990
incorporate checking
within your workflow.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.830
Here I'm running a code command to
make an HTTP request from a terminal.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.280
Key here holds the value of my
API key for PageSpeed Insights.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.160
And I'm redirecting the response
of that request to psi.jason.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.010
Let's open up that file and
take a look at the output.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.480
Looks like psi found one image
that needs to be optimized,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.700
same as it did from the website.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.380
You could easily incorporate this
into build tests when pushing code to

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.630
a repository, for example using
a task runner such as grunt.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.920
In fact there's even a grunt plug-in for
PageSpeed Insights.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.820
For more information about using
PageSpeed to check images with grunt

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.340
