00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.838
But what if we want to divide by something other than a monomial? What if I

00:00:03.838 --> 00:00:08.035
wanted to do this? Here we're dividing a polynomial by a binomial. You might not

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:12.045
know it, but you already have the skills needed to solve this problem. Let's

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:16.004
look at how. We're going to compare this to a division problem that you've seen

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:20.602
before. We're going to divide 4 into 852, and I want you to fill in the boxes

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:25.595
for the division problem. Don't just put the answers here. Complete everything

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:27.944
as if you were doing the long division.
