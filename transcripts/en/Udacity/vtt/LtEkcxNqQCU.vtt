00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.420
Let's look through the options.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.670
This one is likely to save way more versions than you really need.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.470
But even if you're only actually saving when there's been a change over

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.770
the course of the hour,

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.360
you're likely to save at points that don't make a lot of sense.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.685
What if you're in the middle of typing a line?

00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:16.110
Your saved versions might not even compile,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.005
much less make sense as a logical checkpoint.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.700
This option does have the advantage that if you tend to be forgetful, and

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.230
not save often enough on your own it can give you more fine grain detail than

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.340
you would have had.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.390
But otherwise, there's not much reason to make this choice.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.660
Okay, let's look at the second one.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.170
This has some of the same problems as the above, and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.650
you might get versions that aren't actually usable.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.060
Plus, if you write a critical three line change one day and

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.690
then don't touch the code for a week, your change doesn't get

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.380
recorded until after you've made some other unrelated changes.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.810
What about this third one?

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.410
This one's a little bit more promising.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.100
You'll probably get some changes that have some kind of logical meaning from

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.070
this strategy.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.980
But, you might also get some not so meaningful ones that come up when you

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.560
have to go run to catch your train or go have a nice dinner.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.500
Okay, so what about this fourth one?

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.700
This has the potential downside of user error.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.920
Not saving often enough or

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.840
saving too often, but it also offers a lot of flexibility.
