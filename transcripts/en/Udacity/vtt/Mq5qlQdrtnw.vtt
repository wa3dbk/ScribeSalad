An equation is in slope-intercept form if we can write it as something like y

00:00:04.797 --> 00:00:09.690
equals mx plus b, where m is the slope, which conveniently we already have for

00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:14.710
our equation, and b is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. Since we have slots

00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:19.660
for x and y in our equations and we conveniently already have two points that we

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:24.667
know can belong in those two spots, we can use either of these points and plug

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.449
it into the slots for x and y. So we can start off with what we already know,

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:34.450
using the slope. I am going to use this point, 100,1200 and plug 100 in for x

00:00:34.462 --> 00:00:39.645
and 1200 in for y. That's because we know that this point, or the coordinates of

00:00:39.657 --> 00:00:44.804
this point, when substituted into the proper places in this equation, satisfy

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:49.358
this equation, or make it a true statement. That means we're allowed to use

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.121
them. I still don't know what the y coordinate of our y intercept is, so I would

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:58.725
really like to figure that out with the equation. So I want to get b by itself

00:00:58.737 --> 00:01:03.245
on one side of the equation, and I end up with 700 equals b. Now you can take

00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:08.154
this value and put it back in the equation we started with. That gives us a

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:13.465
final equation of y equals 5 x plus 700. So this is our answer. You could have

00:01:13.477 --> 00:01:18.829
of course used the point 60, 1000 instead of 100,1200. And we can check to see

00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:24.453
this is right by plugging in each of the coordinates for the 2 points to it. And

00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:29.575
seeing if each side ends up equaling the other side.
