00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.265
So, like we've done a couple of times before, let's start off by going through

00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:08.460
the terms one by one to see if any of them are like terms. X squared right here,

00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:12.715
is the only terms with an x squared in it. And negative y squared over here is

00:00:12.727 --> 00:00:16.740
also the only term with a y squared in it. However we have these two middle

00:00:16.752 --> 00:00:20.511
terms that each have an x to the first and a y to the first. In them.

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:25.292
So, are they like terms. Well, according to our rules up here, they do have the

00:00:25.304 --> 00:00:30.122
same variables, and those two variables, x and y have the same power. The x here

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:34.700
is x to the first, as is the x here, and the y here is y to the first, as is the

00:00:34.712 --> 00:00:39.316
y here. So presumably they are like terms. What we need to do is use the

00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:44.655
commutative property of multiplication, that we talked about a long time ago, to

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:48.995
make these look the same. We know from the commutative property of

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:53.850
multiplication that x times y or just xy is equal to y times x or just yx. So

00:00:53.862 --> 00:00:58.667
I'm going to rewrite this term right here, 7yx as 7xy instead. It's amazing how

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.769
switching around the orders of factors within terms can change the way an entire

00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:06.616
expression looks. Now our job is pretty standard. The terms that we're not

00:01:06.628 --> 00:01:10.345
combining I'm just going to write as they are, so x squared is the same. And

00:01:10.357 --> 00:01:14.161
then I'm going to combine these two terms in the middle. So remember we add

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:19.905
their coefficients. 3 plus negative 7, or 3 minus 7 which is negative 4 times

00:01:19.917 --> 00:01:24.644
the variables x and y minus y squared which doesn't change
