00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.874
Let me give a few examples on the GPU.

00:00:02.874 --> 00:00:08.712
So, on the GPU, picking good algorithms really means picking algorithms that are fundamentally parallel.

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:13.522
My favorite example of this is related to the example I gave for the CPU where I compared mergesort,

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:17.918
which is order n log n with insertion sort, which is order n squared.

00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:23.155
Now, in fact, most CPU algorithm texts would probably tell you that heapsort,

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:26.492
which is also order n log in, is a better choice than either of these.

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:32.031
It tends to run a little better on the CPU, but it turns out that heapsort is all about

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.004
updating this shared data structure called the heap,

00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:39.876
and that's a very hard thing to do in parallel. And so, in practice, a mergesort is a much better choice

00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:42.116
on a parallel machine like the GPU.

00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:45.781
In terms of basic principles for efficiency, we've already discussed some of these.

00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:49.955
A big one is coalescing global memory accesses, and another is using shared memory,

00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:53.390
which is faster for frequently accessed data within a thread block.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.735
We'll just touch on a few GPU ninja topics like optimizing bank conflicts and shared memory

00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:05.165
and optimizing the use of registers, and I've certainly seen my share of GPU bit twiddling micro optimization.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:09.838
One example that comes to mind is the use of floating-point denorms

00:01:09.838 --> 00:01:15.539
in order to abuse the floating-point arithmetic units for additional integer math performance,

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.582
and this kind of stuff is just firmly in the ninja category.

00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:21.658
You know, it's almost never worth the time or the code obfuscation that results,

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:24.524
and we won't be talking about them at all today.
