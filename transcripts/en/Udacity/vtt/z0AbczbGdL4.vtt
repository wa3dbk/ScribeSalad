00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.135
Let's look at this first case. If I choose a number like 3, I get the absolute

00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:08.400
value of 3 equal to the absolute value of 3. The distance of these numbers from

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:12.380
zero are both 3, so that one works. If I make the second one negative 3, well,

00:00:12.392 --> 00:00:16.260
the absolute value is still 3. The distance of these numbers from zero is 3.

00:00:16.357 --> 00:00:20.610
This one is correct and this one is also correct. We just switch the sides that

00:00:20.622 --> 00:00:24.843
the absolute values are on. And finally, if we had both negative numbers, well,

00:00:24.937 --> 00:00:28.681
that would be correct as well. The distance of negative 3 from zero is 3. So,

00:00:28.693 --> 00:00:32.786
all these cases are true. We're going to use this information to figure out how

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:35.259
to solve this problem. Let's take a closer look.
