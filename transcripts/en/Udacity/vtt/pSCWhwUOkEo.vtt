00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.400
Let's talk about why hijacks matter. Let's suppose

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.230
that you would like to visit a particular

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.400
Website. To do so you first need to issue a DNS query. Now the authoritative DNS

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.480
server for a particular domain might be located

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.030
in a distant network. As we've discussed in

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.460
previous lessons, The DNS uses a hierarchy to

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.580
direct your query to the location of the authoritative

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.530
name server, but ultimately that authoritative name

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.300
server has an IP address, and you use

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.190
the internet's routing protocol, the border gateway protocol,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.290
to reach that IP address. What if an

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.360
attacker were running a rogue DNS server And

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.430
wanted to hijack your DNS query. Or to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.060
return a false IP address. Well, the attacker

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.820
might use BGP to advertise a route for

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.340
the IP prefix that contains. That

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.790
authoritative DNS server. And suddenly your DNS

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.780
queries that were previously going to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.390
the legitimate server, are instead redirected to

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.660
the rouge DNS server. So we might think of this as an attack where by an

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:16.300
attacker can use the DGP infrastructure to hijack a DNS. Query,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.690
and masquerade as a legitimate service. It can get even worse than this.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.220
Let's now look at how a BGP route hijack can result in a Man in

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.740
the Middle attack, whereby your traffic ultimately

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.810
reaches the correct destination, but the attacker

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.020
successfully inserts themselves on the path. The

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.960
problem with this particular route hijack. Is that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.870
all traffic destined for IP X is going

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.610
to head for the attacker, even the traffic

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.520
from the legitimate network. What we'd like to

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.360
instead have happened is that traffic for IP X

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.510
first goes to the hijack location and then

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.050
goes to the legitimate location. So the attacker effectively

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.560
becomes a Man In The Middle. The problem

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.340
is that we need to somehow disrupt the routes

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.210
to the rest of the internet while

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.000
leaving the routes between the attacker and the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.710
legitimate location intact. So that traffic along this

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.300
path can still head towards the legitimate AS.
