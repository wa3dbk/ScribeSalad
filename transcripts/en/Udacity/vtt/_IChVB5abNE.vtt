So now when you're up and running with conference

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.060
central you have a pretty good idea of how to

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.770
write and deploy app engine applications. In the last lesson

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.210
we also covered usage management and we added it to

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.050
conference central so only authenticated users can access the application.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.140
When you write applications you very often need to store

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.390
data. And as you know, there are a number of

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.080
ways you can do this. App Engine is no exception.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.790
It can work with a number of different storage technologies.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.566
But there is one that is particularly important, it's called Datastore.

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:40.978
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:44.840
This is the Big Table restaurant here at Google. You may have heard of Big

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.290
Table. It's a technology Google created and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.960
published a famous paper about in 2006. Big

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.360
Table allows unlimited amount of data to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.310
be stored and searched effectively. And many of

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.400
the huge services being run here at Google

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.310
chose Big Table to store data. You know

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.530
what? App Engine Datastore also uses Big Table. That means

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.220
that your applications ge the same massive scale. Isn't that great?

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.660
Hm, but I'm starting to feel a little bit hungry. Hey! I think I'll go in,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:31.024
and get a big bite in the Big Table restaurant! See you in class! [NOISE]
