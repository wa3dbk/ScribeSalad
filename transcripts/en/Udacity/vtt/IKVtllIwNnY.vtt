00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.290
Now this duality between a spine and

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.180
binary arithmetic is the key
to understanding how to

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.260
perform all these operations on bags
like insert, union and splitting.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.540
Let's start with binary math.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.604
Suppose you want to compute 23 + 1,
but do it in base 2.

00:00:17.604 --> 00:00:20.135
Let's start by writing out 23 and
1 in binary.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.700
So here's what you did in
computer science preschool.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.082
See 1 + 1 is 0, carry the 1, 1 + 1 is 0,

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:39.720
carry the 1, 1 + 1 is 0, carry the 1.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.920
Finally, a little variety.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.700
1 + 0 is 1 with no carry,
and finally drop the 1.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.430
Let's see, so did we get this right?

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.854
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 16 + 8 is 24.

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:54.713
Voila.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.593
Now, if you want to put
a single element into a bag,

00:01:04.593 --> 00:01:08.650
you're going to do the morally
equivalent thing to binary addition.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.210
Let's see an example.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.180
Suppose you have a bag with 23 elements
and you want to insert a new element.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.090
First, try to put it into the least
significant bit of the spine.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.170
Rats, there's already a pennant there.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.280
Okay, no big deal.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.960
Let's create a new pennant
of twice the size.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.770
The only gotcha now is that this
pennant is in the wrong place.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.160
It's trying to occupy a slot along
the spine for pennants of size 1.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.060
So, we'll need to carry
it into the next slot and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.570
replace the current slot
with a null pointer.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.590
Now let's repeat the process and try to
insert this new pennant into slot one.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.080
Again, the slot's occupied so
we gotta move on.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.699
Let's combine the 2 size 2 pennants
into a size 4 pennant, carry it, and

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:50.009
then 0 out the slot.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.322
And then you basically just keep
going til the pennant that you're

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:57.250
carrying eventually reaches
a spot where you can insert it.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.570
So here's a question,
what's the cost of doing this insertion?
