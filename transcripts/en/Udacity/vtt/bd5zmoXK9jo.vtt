00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.390
It's very important to have co-founders,
mainly because as one

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.690
person you can fall sick, you can become
frail, you can run out of energy or

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.859
steam, or something can get in
your way as an obstacle and

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.070
a co-founder can help you
overcome that obstacle.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.070
So where one is strong two are powerful.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.830
Where two are powerful,
three are ultimate.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.020
It also helps keep things balanced.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.360
It's good to have other opinions
that are not just your own.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.910
I'm not saying sole proprietorship
doesn't work, it just requires

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.200
that much more out of you and
sustainability can be a challenge.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.335
So having a co-founder is a very
good way to have somebody

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:50.130
like-minded support the business
in a similar manner to you,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.370
while bringing their own
strengths to the table.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.710
So, for me, the key advantage
to having a co-founder is that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.560
you get to share the load.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.600
You both bring your
strengths to the table and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.860
you're trading your strengths against
the other person's weaknesses.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.780
And that makes for
a very strong cohesive thing.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.380
Affectively you're marrying this
other person for some period of time

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.350
because you're both very committed
to what it is you're trying to build
