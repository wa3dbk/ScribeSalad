00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.650
So far, we've worked with the numerator being 1. We have only had one piece out

00:00:03.662 --> 00:00:07.175
of five. Let's see what else we can do. Here's a square again, and I'm going to

00:00:07.187 --> 00:00:10.775
split it up into four parts. Now, instead of having one piece, I'm going to have

00:00:10.787 --> 00:00:14.125
three. So now the area of this shaded square is 3 4ths. My numerator is 3,

00:00:14.212 --> 00:00:17.650
because I have three pieces. My denominator is 4, because I've split up my

00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:21.218
square into four equal pieces. Here's another square, and this time, I'm going

00:00:21.218 --> 00:00:25.605
to have all the pieces. Let's see what that looks like. So, now I have 4 out of

00:00:25.617 --> 00:00:29.705
4. When I have 4 divided by 4, that's really 1. Now that we've seen that the

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:33.970
numerator doesn't have to be 1, let's try an example where it's not. We'll try

00:00:33.982 --> 00:00:35.055
this out with a quiz.
