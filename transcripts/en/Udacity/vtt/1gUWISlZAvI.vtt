00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.446
Well, let's see if we're right with these assumptions. I calculated the

00:00:03.446 --> 00:00:08.770
t-statistic for each one of these also using r. Use these to calculate the p

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.668
value for each. You can do this with graphpad.com quick calcs. The link is

00:00:14.668 --> 00:00:18.274
below. After you get in to quick calcs, you need to choose statistical

00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:24.854
distributions and interpreting p value. Then choose calculate p value from z,

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:29.454
t, f, r, or chi-square. You'll learn about chi-squared in the last lesson of

00:00:29.454 --> 00:00:34.787
this course. Click Continue, enter the value of r and the degrees of freedom,

00:00:34.787 --> 00:00:39.792
then click Compute p. Quick calcs will give the two tailed p value. So eneter

00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:44.184
the 2 tailed P relationship here and see if it's less than an alpha level of

00:00:44.184 --> 00:00:45.713
0.5
