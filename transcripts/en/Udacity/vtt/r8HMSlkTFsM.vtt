00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.510
The Query Envelope standard
serves to provide identification

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.200
that is unique within the network.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.602
This includes the requester ID,
their name, e-mail and organization.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.420
It also provides the purpose,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.330
priority and type of the query
using seven purpose codes.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.085
For example, treat for treatment.

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:25.300
Its priority from one to five,
with one being the highest.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.730
And an alphanumeric type that
can be as many as 20 characters.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.820
It identifies the level
of PHI that's involved.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.645
Is this aggregated patient data?

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:40.093
Limited data,
de-identified patient data, or

00:00:40.093 --> 00:00:44.500
fully identified protected
health information?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.150
And finally the timing,
what's the submission date and time, and

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.930
optionally, when should
the query be executed.
