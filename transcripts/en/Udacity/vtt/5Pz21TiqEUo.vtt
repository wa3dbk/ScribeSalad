00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.538
The year never changed, but year is how we're controlling the loop. So we

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:10.490
needed to remember to increment year by 1. Inside the body of the loop. Now if

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.360
I run this again, the output is much more manageable. It's pretty easy to make

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.500
this kind of mistake. Where you forget to update the loop counter variable.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.214
We're going to show you a way to write a loop that is good for cases like this

00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:25.280
one, when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something.
