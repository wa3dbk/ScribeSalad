00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.760
First of all, let's run our app once so
we can call the preload data method

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.890
that deletes all the previous
contents of the database, and

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.810
then populates it with notebooks and
nodes.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.070
And here we have our preloaded data.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.020
So let's go to app delegate.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.500
And let's comment it out.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.980
As we don't need this anymore, we can
create objects using the app's UI.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.915
So let's comment out pre-load data.

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:34.669
And now, let's go back to the model and
make some modifications.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.430
Let's create a new entity for photo
frame with an image data attribute.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.840
We can't save the image
as an instance of UI

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.420
image because core data has
no idea what a UI image is.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.478
So we have to save it as a binary
type which means [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:52.478 --> 00:00:54.760
It's a bit inconvenient but
we'll deal with it later.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.670
Every single note will
have a photo frame and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.150
each photo frame might
have a single image data.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.630
This property is going to be
optional as it could be empty but

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.810
every note will have an image data.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.670
So now we have to create
the relationships between note and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.200
photo free.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.000
It can't be optional because every
note must have a photo so off it goes.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.650
And the deletion rule should be when we
delete a node, we delete the PhotoFrame.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.770
So it should be Cascade.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.420
Now let's go back to PhotoFrame and
create the inverse relationship.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.010
This should not be optional
because a photo frame

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.560
should not exist if it's
not connected to a note.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.555
And when we delete a photo frame,
what should we do to the note?

00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:50.180
Nothing so nullify.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.770
Okay so let's save and
run our app and see what happens and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.000
it looks like we have an error and
this is the reason.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.400
The model used to open
the store is incompatible

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.199
with the one used to create this store.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.440
Well we got this error because
we already have saved objects

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.030
that match the previous data model,
the one that didn't have a photo frame.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.650
Now we changed this model but

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.410
we forgot to tell core data how to
migrate the older data to the new form.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.320
Fortunately, this is quite easy.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.649
So think about it and

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:33.510
make sure you can't reproduce this on
your own project and we'll fix it.
