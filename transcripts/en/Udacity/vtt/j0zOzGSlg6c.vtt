00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.490
Imagine you're going on the Internet and reaching

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.350
a Web portal, such as gmail, let's say,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.670
for accessing your email. In fact, while you're

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.470
doing this, a million other clients are doing

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.720
exactly the same thing, trying to reach the

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.360
web portal through the IP network. The service

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.160
that you're trying to reach may be architected

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.576
to direct your particular request to a specific site.

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:31.908
And the architecture within that site may look like this, a whole bunch of

00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:34.918
servers, maybe on the order of thousands

00:00:34.918 --> 00:00:38.444
or even 10,000, within a cold dark room,

00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:41.970
interconnected to one another through perhaps a

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.109
high bandwidth communication backplane. And also all of

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.625
the servers are connected to data stores

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:51.605
for processing requests that may be coming in.

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:56.341
And the servers may optionally use a backplane that allows them to talk to one

00:00:56.341 --> 00:01:02.970
another for servicing any particular request. Any of the servers may be able to

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.750
handle an incoming client request. Now in

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.830
the generic picture that I'm showing you here,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.500
the load manager that is sitting in

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.920
between these servers, and the IP network redirects

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.080
an incoming client's request to one the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.010
servers. The chosen server may than process the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.980
query and answer the client. The role of

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.670
the load manager is to balance the client

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.550
traffic among all the servers. Basically, the load

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.570
manager has to make sure that no particular

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.480
server is overloaded. One of the characteristics of

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.540
most of the giant scale services is that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.010
the these client requests that are coming in are

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.250
all independent of one another. Sometimes, this also called

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.010
embarrassingly parallel, meaning that all of these client requests

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.800
can be handled in parallel. So long as it is

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.070
enough server capacity to meet all the incoming requests.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.570
So the rule of the load manager is to

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.760
balance the client traffic and redirect them to the

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.820
server so that no particular server is overloaded and all

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.520
of the servers get equally utilized in

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.620
servicing incoming requests. The other responsibility of

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.200
the load manager is to hide partial

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.210
failures. Because when we're talking about the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.530
scale of giant scale services, and the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.830
kind of computational power that resides in

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.190
the data center for servicing these giant

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.750
scale services, they're humongous, they're 10,000 nodes.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.050
And when you have so many nodes, compute nodes and data nodes and so on, it's

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.820
not a question of if something will fail,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.910
but is a question of when something is going

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.730
to fail. So the load manager has to make sure that it is observing the state

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.160
of the servers and insuring that the incoming

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.780
client requests are shielded from any such failures that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.220
may happen internally, within a particular site.
