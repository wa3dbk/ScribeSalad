00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.600
Although it may sound like, all the problems have been solved by

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.900
just selecting the correct architectural style, there are still some issues.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.940
One important one is that for real systems, big systems it may

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.940
require more than one architectural style. We call that a Heterogeneous system,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.620
you can imagine for example that the. System might have

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.030
some client/server elements that might have a GUI make it reactive. It may be

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.260
the combination of a variety of, of, of of different approaches and the systems,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.780
you still have to have an architecture so that, so you have a single concept for

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.730
how the system is going to work. Secondly. Some situations, although

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.210
they call for having an architectural style, style are very domain specific. For

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.920
example, imagine in military context of a particular kind of airplane.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.140
It may be the case, it is the case that that airplane comes in a variety of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.310
variants. However, the control systems for the airplane is pretty much

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.920
the same across variance. That is, it shares more than it differs.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.230
In this situation, we call it a Domain-specific software architecture, or

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.720
DSSA. Another term sometimes used is reference architecture,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.120
that is the reference architecture describes what's common. And then for

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.950
any particular variant, the architecture responsible for

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.900
saying what those variants are, and how they're going to be dealt with.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.480
The third issue is one of semantics. It's easier for me, it's easy for

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.260
me to lay out and say, a client server is XYZ. But what exactly does that mean?

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.030
It's important, and as the field of software architecture evolves,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.350
to get more and more precise definitions of what these styles mean.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.540
Which will then enable, reuse of, of existing solutions.
