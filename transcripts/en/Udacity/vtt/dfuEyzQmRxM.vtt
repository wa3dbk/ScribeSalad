Another important role during a review meeting is that of the recorder.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.560
The recorder is responsible for making a record of the issues raised during

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.490
a review. Note that it may not be possible to determine in a review meeting

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.219
itself whether an issue represents a defect. This determination may

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.660
require some offline research. It is the job of the recorder to proactively

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.659
clarify the issues raised. During the course of a heated, heated discussion,

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.950
this may be difficult. Several different issues may intertwine more of

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.600
a two seemingly different concerns may actually reflect a common question.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.130
The recorder will often ask for clarification until he is satisfied that he

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.450
understands the essence of the problem being discussed.
