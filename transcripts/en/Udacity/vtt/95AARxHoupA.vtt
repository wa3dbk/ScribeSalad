00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.040
I like to think of intents as envelopes,
each one who includes who,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.919
or in this case, which component 
you want it delivered to.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.040
And there's room for a small amount 
of data to be delivered,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.509
packaged as extras.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.540
Primitive tuples that will be 
available to the application component

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.140
that ultimately receives 
and opens this intent.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.660
An explicit intent explicitly specifies 
the name of the recipient,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.296
as you can see on this envelope.

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.762
Implicit intents are a lot 
more interesting.

00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:34.410
Here, we don't specify 
the name of the class.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080
We don't even know what it is.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.710
So, how do we indicate 
which activity to launch?

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.560
You know those stories you 
sometimes hear about letters

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.970
with fake addresses like these 
that somehow still find

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.566
their way to the recipient?

00:00:49.136 --> 00:00:52.492
Well the intent resolution system 
on Android works the same way,

00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:57.040
finding an activity
capable of performing the action

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.210
you specify on the associated data.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.380
So, rather than specifying 
the name of a class, you indicate

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.540
an action you'd like 
an activity to perform,

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.420
and on what data that action 
should be performed.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.100
Like this, where we want 
to address an activity

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.910
that's capable of viewing a website. 
And because intents can cross

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.890
through application boundaries, 
the activity that started

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.640
may not be part of your app. 
So, you can include functionality

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.350
like this, browsing websites 
or making phone calls

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.840
or choosing a contact 
from your address book,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.256
all from within your app, 
without you having to implement

00:01:38.256 --> 00:01:39.432
any of it yourself.

00:01:41.032 --> 00:01:42.470
You don't even need 
to know about the app

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.940
that will ultimately service your request.
You can find details

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.190
of some of the intents 
supported by native apps

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.120
in Common Intents page 
of the Android developer site.
