00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.952
Just like all the other problems, we're going to start by dividing each term by

00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:09.665
our divisor, 6fg squared h. 3/6 Reduces to 1/2, so that's going to start my

00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:14.551
answer. F cubed divided by f would leave me with f squared in the numerator, and

00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:19.586
then g squared divided by g squared equals 1. And then h 4th divided by h equals

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:24.719
h cubed. Our second term would be 4fh squared, 24 divided by 6 equals 4 and f

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:29.525
squared divided by f makes f to the 1. The g squared divided by g squared

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:34.722
simplifies to 1 again, and then h cubed divided by h is equal to h squared. And

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:39.805
finally for our last term, we'll have negative 3 halves, f times h. F squared

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:44.746
divided by f is equal to f, and our g squared divided by g squared is equal to

00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:49.438
1, so those simplify out. And finally, we have h squared, divided by h, which

00:00:49.438 --> 00:00:53.504
leaves us with h to the 1. This first term and this last term, were a little

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:57.662
tricky, since we had fractions, but hopefully you got most of the variables

00:00:57.662 --> 00:01:00.717
right. If you got everything right, excellent work.
