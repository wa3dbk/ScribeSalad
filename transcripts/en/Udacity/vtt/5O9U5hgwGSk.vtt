This last one is the best choice. We still want to cap the number of people that

00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:09.776
Grant can hire at 15, still including 15. But we also want to make sure that he

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:14.502
doesn't hire a negative number of people. So we put the end of our range at 0,

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:18.710
but including 0, because technically, he wouldn't have to hire anyone.
