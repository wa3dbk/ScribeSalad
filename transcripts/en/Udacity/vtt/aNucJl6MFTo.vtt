In this session,
we're going to talk about strings.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.600
Now, you may be thinking,
haven't I seen strings before?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.530
What more is there to talk about?

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.510
Actually, there's a lot of fun to
be had playing with strings, and

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.960
we use these data types so often that
they merit a little special attention.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.630
Let's get started.
