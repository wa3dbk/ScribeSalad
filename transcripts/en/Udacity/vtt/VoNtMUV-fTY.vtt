00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.430
For the rest of the unit you'll be entering in routes. Let's get familiar with

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.630
how to enter these different types of roots using our awesome tool Math Quill.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.908
To get the square root symbol we simply want to type a backslash and then the

00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:16.886
letters sqrt for square route. When you type this you won't see anything quite

00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:20.845
yet, you'll just see your backslash and the letters. You'll need to hit space

00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:25.243
in order for the square root symbol to appear. You'll see this, and your cursor

00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:28.134
bar will be underneath the radical symbol for you to type in whatever is

00:00:28.134 --> 00:00:32.986
inside. And for this first one, you would want to type in a 2. But we haven't

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:37.370
just seen square roots. We've also seen cube roots. For a cube root or the nth

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.546
root, we simply want to type in a \ and then these letters. Then of course

00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:46.129
we'll need to hit the Space. This will create a radical sign with our cursor

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.990
bar in the index position for the radical. Here our index is a 3, so we want to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.476
type the number 3 to get that same index. Your cursor will still be in the

00:00:55.476 --> 00:00:59.658
position of the index, so we need to hit the Right Arrow key once. To move it

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:02.871
back down underneath the radical, the cursor bar should appear here now and

00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:07.416
were free to type in whatever expression is inside radical. In this case we

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:11.778
would just type x. Now see few have the hang of it. Try entering these two

00:01:11.778 --> 00:01:15.678
expressions and using the keystrokes on the screen then try tackling these to

00:01:15.678 --> 00:01:22.133
challenge problems. This one combines fractions, exponents, and radicals. And

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:26.793
be careful on this last one there's really a 4 for the index of this group.
