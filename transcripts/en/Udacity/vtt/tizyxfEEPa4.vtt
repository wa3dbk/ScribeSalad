00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.530
Now, let's get in some practice. I want you to write each of these equations in

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.570
logarithmic form. You should have one logarithm, an equals sign and then the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.582
right numbers in the right spots. Good luck. Also, be sure that you don't use

00:00:13.582 --> 00:00:18.918
commas when entering any numbers. Especially for this number, 100,000. You

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.640
don't want to put a comma, right here.
