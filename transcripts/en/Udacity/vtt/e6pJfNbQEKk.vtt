00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.341
Let's calculate the average and standard deviation in this spreadsheet. After

00:00:04.341 --> 00:00:12.974
you Copy and Paste the engagement data into your own spreadsheet. Then in any

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:22.200
blank cell, we'll type equals average, and in this case, B2 column B236. And if

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.740
we go to the bottom, we see that there are 236 rows, but the first row has a

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:37.334
header. So there are 235 values. Now we have the mean in cell E1. Now in cell

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:48.148
D2, we can type equals parentheses B2 minus $E$1, and parentheses.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.611
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:57.240
2, for squared. So that's the first squared deviation from the mean. We'll Copy

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.712
that cell. I'll go to cell C2, hit Cmd, Down Arrow. Go to cell D236, Cmd

00:01:03.712 --> 00:01:12.496
,Shift, Up arrow key. Highlighting column D, Cmd V. Now we have all our squared

00:01:12.496 --> 00:01:20.868
deviations. The average squared deviation is the variance, equals average D2

00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:28.410
column D2, 36. There's our variance, and now the standard devation is the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.280
square root of cell E2. There you have it. Let's round to the 100th place. We

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.500
get the mean is 7.47 and the standard deviation is 2.41, if we round two

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.303
decimal places.
