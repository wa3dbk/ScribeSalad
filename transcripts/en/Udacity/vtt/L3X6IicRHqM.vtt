The values for m are 1/8 and 1/2. Nice solving if you found these two

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.436
fractions. We can replace u with what it equaled from our substitution 4m minus

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:17.585
3. So, this u becomes 4m minus 3, and this u becomes 4m minus 3 as well. Next,

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:21.987
we add 3 to both sides of the equation to get 4m equals negative 5 halves plus

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:27.522
3, and 4m equals 2. Here I want to combine these two together, so this added

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:32.625
together should be positive 1/2. If I haven't convinced you, then think about

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:37.279
what we can change 3 into. We can change what this number looks like by writing

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:44.053
it as a fraction. 3 is the same as 6 divided by 2. So, really we have negative

00:00:44.053 --> 00:00:48.816
5 halves, plus 6 halves. We'll have one more positive halve on this side than

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:54.440
we do negative halve. So, these added together will give us positive 2 halves.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.656
Finally, we divide by 4 on both sides of the equations to get m is equal to 1/2

00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:04.298
times 1/4, and m is equal to 1/2. I know this is true, since, when we divide by

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:10.037
a number, we can really multiply it by its reciporical. So, 1/2 divided by 4 is

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:16.146
1/2 times 1/4. And we know that really equals 1/8. So, 1/8 is one solution, and

00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:18.150
1/2 is the other.
