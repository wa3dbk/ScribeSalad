Let's try another example. This time,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.200
again, there are four blocks. There are two bricks, at the bottom and

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.390
the top. And the two cylinders, both vertical, but they are touching each other.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.100
Is this an example of the concept foo based on what we have learned so far?
