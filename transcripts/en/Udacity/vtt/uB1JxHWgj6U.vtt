00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.220
So here we are, back with our code. Now, the

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.970
only new stuff that I have added to the code

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.470
thus far, is this function called, check_profanity, by the way,

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.440
this function is empty for now. It takes in, one argument,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.380
or one piece of information, which is the text we

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.950
actually want to check for profanity. Now, I know there

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.800
is this module in Python called, urllib, which helps

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.080
us get information from the internet. It, has a function called,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.880
urlopen, which takes in a link to a website.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.509
So here, I'm going to give it the full link,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.428
to the the what do you love website. [SOUND] And

00:00:35.428 --> 00:00:37.868
add to that the text we actually want to check for

00:00:37.868 --> 00:00:41.935
profanity. [SOUND] Now, this function urlopen. Is going to

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:45.280
help us make a connection, to this website. So, I'm going

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.920
to call this, [SOUND] connection. Now I recognize that you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.160
may not be able to read the entire line of code

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.080
that we've written here, so I'm going to temporarily, put

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.270
in a return statement there. So you can read the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.890
whole line of code. And then I'm going to restore

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.680
the code. Okay, let's continue. Now, I want us to

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.230
notice, that this function urlopen, is quite similar to

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.120
the other function that we have used in this program,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.800
which is open. Open, helps us read contents from a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.300
file on our computer. urlopen on the other hand,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.150
helps open a connection to a website on the internet. Then we

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.460
can do things with that connection. Things like, read a response from

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.734
that website. [SOUND] I'm going to call this response, output, and then print

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:33.160
the output. After I've done that, [SOUND] I will close the connection.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.260
So now, it's time for us to call this

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.600
function check_profanity, and I will do that after I have

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.850
successfully read the text from a file on my

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.280
computer. [SOUND] So, let me add code to call the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.448
function, check_profanity, and to it, I will pass in

00:01:50.448 --> 00:01:54.330
the contents that we previous read from the file. I

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.080
am going to save our program. Now if all

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.640
goes well, the read_text function, will read the contents from

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.070
the movie_quotes file, and then the check_profanity function,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.830
will check that text for curse words. Let me

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.250
run my program and oh, it seems like, I forgot to import urllib. So let me go

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.750
back to the code and add that to the very top. [SOUND] There it is. Let me

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.960
save my program, and run again. And this time,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.390
the program worked and the programs response is false,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.830
which means that the movie quotes, have no

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.350
curse words in them. Now, if I go back

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.310
to my movie quotes file. And change just one

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.940
word, let me save this file. And run my

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.660
code one more time. Now the response changes to

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.530
true, which means that there was a curse word

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.130
in our movie codes file. Alright, so it seems

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.020
like we're getting very close to finishing this code.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.019
But before we do, [SOUND] I want us to figure out. How

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.690
Python knows about this think urllib and urlopen, let's find out.
