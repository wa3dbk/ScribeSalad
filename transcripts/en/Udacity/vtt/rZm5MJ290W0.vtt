There is one more thing, on viewports. You're naturally,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.200
going to want to lay out, elements on the page,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.320
relative to the size of the viewport. Particularly, when you're

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.550
sizing columns on the page, for example. So, we have

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.010
a new unit type, in, CSS called, viewport units.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.790
You can use these units, to size things, in percentage

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.600
of width of viewport or percentage of height of viewport.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.700
Without having to push percentage sizing, everywhere, which makes things

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.510
a little easier. The really exciting thing, is, these unit types

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.910
even work in desktop browsers, as well as in mobile browsers.
