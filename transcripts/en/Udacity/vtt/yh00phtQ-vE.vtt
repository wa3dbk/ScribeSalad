00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.196
So the first rule in our Pythonista's Guide to solving all problems in the known

00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:10.270
computational galaxy is to always ask what are the inputs? Now, there is one

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.905
rule before the first rule, that's the zeroth rule. And the zeroth rule is don't

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:19.598
panic. If you panic, you're never going to solve the problem. But the first

00:00:19.598 --> 00:00:22.253
substantial rule is to figure out what the inputs are.
