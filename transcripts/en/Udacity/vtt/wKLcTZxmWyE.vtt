00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.400
You didn't think we were just
going to be playing Asteroids

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.990
games forever, did you?

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.550
This is Pie Noon, it's a more
sophisticated example you can refer to

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.100
in order to see how a variety of how
more advanced techniques are used.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.950
It's a simple multiplayer party game,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.914
where you can throw
pies at your friends.

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:15.905
It's written in C++ and

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:19.625
supports up to four players using
a multiscreen mode with Android TV.

00:00:20.845 --> 00:00:23.775
In this section, I'll introduce topics
in technologies that help you create

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:25.105
a great gaming experience,

00:00:25.105 --> 00:00:28.485
as well as something to take advantage
of unique capabilities of Android.

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:30.305
We won't go into great depth
with each of these, but

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:33.190
you will get an idea of what
the different components have to offer.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.730
And when you're ready,
you can explore further

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.650
on your own by following the links
in the instruction notes.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.080
First up,
we have Google Play games services.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.210
You can think of Google Play
services as a toolbox,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.690
which is tightly
integrated with Android.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.480
It helps you with common
tasks in game development.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.170
These include storing and
synchronizing game data on the cloud,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.160
as well as sending invitations and
auto-matching players.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.510
Also included are tools to
help you build real time and

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.610
turn based multiplayer
gaming experiences.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.050
It also helps you build achievements and

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.300
quests into your game,
which are great ways to hook players.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.470
You can also collect analytics
data to help you understand how

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.480
players interact with your game.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.710
All you have to do is create an account
on the Play Developer Console,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.639
and this works a lot like the Cast
Developer Console we covered earlier.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.040
All these features are free of charge,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.220
aside from a small one-time
fee to verify your account.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.830
After that, you can access all these
games features via Google API client,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.170
just like when you use any other
feature with Google Play services.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.470
And don't forget to add this scope games
when you create your API client object,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.350
that's a common mistake that
developers do all the time.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.118
Next up are nearby connections.

00:01:33.118 --> 00:01:36.346
The nearby connections API let's you
discover other devices on the local

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:39.740
network and exchange messages
with them in real time.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.170
This let's you do two great things.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.350
First you can allow one player to setup
a multiplayer game on the local network

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.580
and then have other players join in.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.130
Or much cooler in my opinion,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.930
one player can setup the game on
a shared device like an Android TV.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.510
Then other players can join
in using their mobile device

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.120
as a display controller combination.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.550
Individual players see a customized
display on their mobile device

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.450
as well as a shared display
on their main screen.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.610
This is a very unique and
extremely catchy capability, and

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.960
it makes your game super easy to use and
fun to interact with.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.830
Inside the instructor notes, you'll find
a video demonstrating exactly how this

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.028
works, and doc you can follow
to build this into your game.

00:02:16.028 --> 00:02:21.410
In Android 5.0 Lollipop or higher,
multiple networks are supported.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.200
This means that there can be more than
one connecting network on an Android TV

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.470
device at one time.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.100
For instance, both ethernet and Wi-Fi.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.810
You can check for this case
using the connectivity manager.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.480
And if so,
you can actually select the type of

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.760
network you'd like to use in your game.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.390
Although there's usually not
a tremendous difference,

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.880
some developers prefer ethernet for
the slightly lower latency.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.865
Next up we have WebP.

00:02:41.865 --> 00:02:44.850
WebP is an open sourced image
format developed by Google.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.500
It's more space efficient than JPEG or

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.490
PNG without a noticeable
loss in quality.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.280
You can use this to
compress your textures and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.960
reduce the size of your
final game package.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.978
WebP supports transparency in loss
less compression as well as loss

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:00.564
compression if you need
even smaller file sizes.

00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:03.220
As a default this is supported by
Android TV, so you don't need to

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.450
add any external libraries to encode and
decode WebP images.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.680
There are also open source libraries for
other platforms.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.440
And speaking of Pie Noon and C++, you
should be aware of the Android NDK, or

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.330
Native Development Toolkit.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.270
This tool set allows you to implement
parts of your app using native code.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.720
A really important note here,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.100
the vast majority of apps will not
benefit from this approach, and

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.030
you should do this only if you have
a very good and very specific reason.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.175
The best reason I can think
of is if you have a large,

00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:33.270
pre-existing code base you'd like to
reuse, like in the case of High Noon.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.120
Generally, the performance
tradeoffs of using C++,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.540
if any,
are not worth the complexity cost.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.230
Now on Android TV, NDK almost always
works without any problems at all.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.020
However I'd strongly recommend you
test your code on a real device,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.720
not on an emulator.
