00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.290
Stacks can be really useful when you
only care about the most recent elements

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.930
or the order in which you see and
save elements actually matters.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.200
Maybe you have a page like a news feed.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.350
You'll need to access the more
recent elements more quickly and

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.719
more frequently, but

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.970
you may need to show all of the elements
when the user scrolls down.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.620
There is some specific terminology
associated with stacks.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.150
When you add an element to a stack,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.590
the operation is called
push instead of insert.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.710
When you take an element
off of the stack,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.280
the operation is called
a pop instead of remove.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.940
Remember all you need here is to look
at the top element of the stack.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.830
So the operation should be
constant time for both operations.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.920
Now here's a possibly confusing point
because a stack is pretty abstract,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.960
it could actually be implemented
with another data type.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.149
What each element looks like and
how there’s connected aren't

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.640
actually specified, just the methods for
adding and removing elements.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.150
For example you could use a link
list to implement a stack.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.800
You would keep track of the front
of a single link list and

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.390
just keep adding elements
on top as you went.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.720
I also want to note that you
might see the notation L.I.F.O.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.570
associated with stacks.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.259
This acronym means Last In, First Out.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.560
All it's saying is the last element you
put on the stack when you use push,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.690
is always the first one you
get out when you use pop.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.500
It's just a fancy way of saying
something you hopefully already know

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.270
about Stacks.
