00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.147
To start this division problem, we want to think about what number, times 3a, is

00:00:05.147 --> 00:00:09.833
6a squared, well that must be positive 2a. 2a Times 3a is 6a squared, and 2a

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:14.961
times positive 2, is positive 4a. Next we subtract this second expression. When

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:20.446
we do subtraction, we simply change all the signs. We distribute the negative 1.

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:26.036
6a Squared minus 6a squared equals zero, And minus 17a minus 4a, is negative 21

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:31.476
a, then we just bring down our negative 14 to continue long division. Next we

00:00:31.476 --> 00:00:36.727
want to think about what number times 3a is equal to negative 21a. The number

00:00:36.727 --> 00:00:41.074
must be negative 7, negative 7 times 3a is negative 21a, and negative 7 times

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:45.821
positive 2 is negative 14. When we subtract this expression, we really

00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:51.589
distribute the negative 1 which changes both of the signs. Adding our like-terms

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.883
together, we get 0. 2a Minus 7 is our answer and we can check it by, multiplying

00:00:56.883 --> 00:00:57.918
it by 3a plus 2.
