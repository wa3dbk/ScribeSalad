We just threw a lot of terms at you in
that last video, so let's take a closer

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.620
look at common metrics and acronyms
used when it comes to advertising.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.610
There are five we'll be exploring,
CPC, CPM, eCPM, CPI and CTR.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.900
Knowing the definitions for each of
these terms is extremely important,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.060
especially as you're evaluating the
success of using ads in your product.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.030
Let's start with CPC or cost per click.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.150
Now, this is essentially
how much an advertiser pays

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.530
you if a visitor to your site or a user
of your product clicks on their ad.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.310
The acronym CPM is a little tricky.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.441
This stands for cost per thousand and

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:48.788
the M actually is the Roman numeral for
a thousand.

00:00:48.788 --> 00:00:53.860
CPM is how much you earn for
every 1000 views of an add.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.054
This can also be referred to as CPI or

00:00:57.054 --> 00:01:01.640
cost per impression,
another item from our list.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.226
eCPM is then the estimated cost per
thousand views and is calculated by

00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:12.170
dividing your total revenue by the total
number of views of the ad in thousands.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.100
eCPM is helpful when you're evaluating
the performance of different ads on your

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.100
site, and you want to estimate how much
you'll make as the views increase.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.940
Lastly, we come to click-through rate or

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.240
CTR, this metric measures how many
users have actually clicked on an ad.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.460
It's calculated by dividing the total
number of clicks by the total number of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.640
impressions or views, and multiplying
that number by 100 to get a percentage.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.770
So now that we've gone through each
of these definitions, let's test your

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.600
memory and see if you can remember
these three-letter acronyms.
