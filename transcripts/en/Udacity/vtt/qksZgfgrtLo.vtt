00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.010
Now with our dentist example,
we wrote 3 dentists out of 5 dentists

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.810
to describe the ratio of dentists
that prefer a certain toothpaste.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.159
But in math, our units, which in this
case we're referring to dentists,

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:14.029
they behave a bit like numbers actually.

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:18.321
And so what that means is when I have
dentists over dentists like this,

00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:21.814
I can actually simplify by
just crossing out the common,

00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:24.160
we can think of it as a factor.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.010
This means that 3 dentists out of
5 dentists is the same as 3/5.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.370
That is our ratio here, and
it's just a pure number again.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.759
No units involved at all.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.940
We'll see why this is useful in a bit,
but

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.990
first let's do a little
bit of practicing.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.600
Let's look at the first ratio
from our previous question.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720
8 out of 10 cats prefer Whiskas.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.380
Can you write this is a ratio?

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.601
Enter your answer in this box, and

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:50.510
keep in mind what we did here to go from
3 out of 5 dentists to just 3 over 5.
