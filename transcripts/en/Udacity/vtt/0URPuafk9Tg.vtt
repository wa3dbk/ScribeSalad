00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.220
Alright, now, part of the reason, we can't just solve these

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.590
kinds of problems by solving, a system of linear equations and just

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.680
being done with it, the reason we have to do these squares

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.480
is because of the presence of errors. The training data that, that

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.290
we are given, has errors in it. And it's not that

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.950
we're actually modelling, a function, but ,the thing that we're seeing is

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.230
the function plus some, you know, some error term on each piece

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.010
of data. So, I think, it's reasonable to, to think about where

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.340
did these errors come from? So, I don't know,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.270
what do you think ,Charles, why, why is it we're

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.310
trying to fit data, that ,has error in it,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.940
can't we just, can't we just have no errors? [LAUGH]

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.340
&gt;&gt; I would like to have no errors. Certainly ,my code, has

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.900
no errors. [CROSSTALK] well, so let's see where might errors come from.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.340
So, they could come from, sensor error, right? Just ,somehow you're, you're

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.380
getting inputs and you're getting outputs and that output's, being read by,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.320
some machine or by a camera or by something and you just, there's just

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.480
error in the way that you read the data. Just an error in the sensors.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.870
&gt;&gt; Alright, can you think of other ways. I guess, I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.140
guess ,in this case you're imagining that the data came by

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.570
actually measuring something, with the machine. So that, that makes, a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.740
lot of sense. What other ways, can we put together the data?

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.350
&gt;&gt; I don't know I could think of a bunch. I mean

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.450
the error, well, the errors could come, maliciously. There could be some,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.750
something out there, that is trying to give us bad data.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.260
&gt;&gt; Alright, that seems like a possibility, that, when the

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.740
data set was collected, let's say that we're collecting, various,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.990
Oh, maybe if I. Oh, this happens, this happens a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.830
lot. So, so, if you're trying to collect data from

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.770
other Computer Science departments and you're trying to put together,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.340
some kind of collection of, you know, how much do you

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.748
spend on your. Graduate students ,say,uh, sometimes ,these departments will

00:01:43.748 --> 00:01:47.108
actually misrepresent the data and give you give you, things that

00:01:47.108 --> 00:01:48.945
are wrong. Because, they don't want to tell you the

00:01:48.945 --> 00:01:50.910
truth, because they're afraid of what you are going to do.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've noticed that everyone does

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.779
that except, for Georgia Tech and Brown University.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are highly honest and reputable universities in my experience.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I feel.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.800
&gt;&gt; well, another time that you can get data, is if somebody, is,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.180
copying stuff down. So, what about sort of the idea of a transcription error.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.370
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.350
&gt;&gt; So we're just, you know, we've

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.730
copied everything, but, you know, there's, there's

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.990
just some of the, some of the lines that got filled in just got mistyped.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you think ,that's different from sensor error?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.280
&gt;&gt; Well, it's, it's maybe a slightly different

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.020
kind of sensor error, right? So ,sensor errors

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.270
were actually saying there's something physical, that's being

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.220
measured and there's just noise in that. Transcription

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.605
error, is similar except it's a person. [LAUGH]

00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:31.730
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.390
&gt;&gt; Right? The, the there's a little blips in the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.620
person's head and they can do, it can be a

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.090
very different kind of error. You can get, like transpositions

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.600
of digits, maybe instead of ,um, just you know, noise.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.530
&gt;&gt; Okay, how bout, how bout one more? How about ,uh,

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.680
there's really, just noise, in the process. So how about that, that we

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.360
took in input X, but there's something else going on in the world, that

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.395
we weren't measuring, and so the output

00:02:57.395 --> 00:02:59.815
,might depend on other things besides, simply

00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:02.440
,the input that we're looking at. So what would be an example of that?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.910
&gt;&gt; So an un-modeled influence, might be, well, if we're.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.205
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Let's look at the housing data.

00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:08.800
&gt;&gt; That's what I, that's what I was thinking

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.770
exactly. So ,in the housing data ,we were just

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.550
trying to relate, the size of the houses, to the price, but, there's

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.130
a lot of other things like change of the houses to the price and

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.540
&gt;&gt; Location, location.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.480
&gt;&gt; Location and location, right those are three really good reasons, that

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.370
are not in the particular regression,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.107
that we did, that could ,actually influence

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:30.580
the prices. So right, that and, you know, the quality of the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.980
house and who, who built it, and, you know, the colors, the colors.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.850
&gt;&gt; Even, even, even time of day, or what

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.620
the interest rates were that morning, versus the, what

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.100
people thought they might be the next day. Who knows?

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.530
&gt;&gt; Right and so all these different things are

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.950
being considered ,in that particular regression, so we're just

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.840
kind of imagining ,that it's noise, that it's just

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.340
having a, a ,uh, bumpy influence on the whole process.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.840
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.280
&gt;&gt; All right. So, so what I'd like you to do is select ,the ones

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.350
that you think actually are important, the

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.990
ones that, that, that could actually come up,

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.420
when you're using machine learning and regression to solve your problems.
