00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] 2 + 2, we're actually pretty sure this works out.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There's no error for this one; it's going to evaluate to 4.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Down here Mars=Earth + 1.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There is actually going to be a problem here, and the problem relates to Earth,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which is a variable that's used before it's being defined,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and python's going to emit some sort of run-time error saying,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
"I don't know what Earth is so I don't know how to assign Earth + 1 to the variable Mars."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This one will result in some sort of error.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Over here, we assign Mars to be 4, and that's totally fine, and then we assign

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Mars to be Mars + 0 or another 4, so no errors here,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but, finally, in this last one, we take a string, Mars, and we add an integer, 2, to it,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and we don't expect addition to work on both strings and integers.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This one also leads to an error.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Mars is sometimes called the red planet, the fourth rock from the sun, and among other things,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it features very prominently in Gustav Holst's 7 movement orchestral suite, The Planets,

00:00:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
which was written in about 1915, worth giving a listen to if you haven't yet run into it.
