00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.745
Here the correct answers were 2 plus or minus i times root 6. That's amazing

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:09.829
work if you got these answers correct. We want to start by dividing each term

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:15.250
of our equation by 3. So dividing each of these by 3 we'll get x squared minus

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.222
4x plus 10 equals 0. Now we're in a position to complete the square. Our a term

00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:26.166
is one, and our b term is even. We subtract 10 from both sides to get x squared

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:31.154
minus 4x equals negative 10. We complete the square by adding 4 to both sides

00:00:31.154 --> 00:00:36.478
of the equation. This gives us the quantity, x minus 2 squared equal to

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:41.428
negative 6. Then, we take the square root of both sides of the equation to get

00:00:41.428 --> 00:00:46.860
x minus 2 equals positive or negative i root 6. We add 2 to both sides to solve

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.620
for x. And these are the two solutions.
