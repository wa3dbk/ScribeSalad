Vasco, from Portugal, asks:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In a world where we already have Google and other search engines,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
what are the advantages of building another search engine?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So certainly, you don't want to try to duplicate something

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that behaves exactly like Google does,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because Google works pretty well at what it does.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But there are lots of things you can do that would be

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
different from what Google does.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
One of the best examples of that is the search engine called DuckDuckGo,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we had a visit from Gabriel Weinberg a few weeks ago.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There's a video, with a few clips from that visit,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
where he talks about what motivated him to build DuckDuckGo.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There''ll be a few more clips of that later in this course

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
where you'll get some idea of the kinds of things

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that he thought were interesting to make a new search engine,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and why he was motivated to build one.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But there are lots of things that you can think about that would be

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
new features that are different from what Google does--

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
or specializing your search engine for a particular kind of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
corpus that you're searching for.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Probably, you don't want to try to build a generic Web search engine, like Google,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
unless you've got some ideas how to go beyond that or

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to do things differently, that would be more interesting.
