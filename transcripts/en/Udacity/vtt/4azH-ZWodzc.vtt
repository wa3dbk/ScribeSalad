00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.145
The trick here was to identify the pattern. If we look at the total number of

00:00:04.157 --> 00:00:08.050
wiper blades that have been made at the end of any one of the days on this

00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:12.125
table, and then we look at how many have been made by the end of the next day,

00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:16.465
that is where we see the pattern. After the first day, there are 23, but after

00:00:16.477 --> 00:00:20.403
the second day, there are 46. The difference between 46 and 23 is 23.

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:25.126
To get from 46 to 69, we have to add 23 again. And we do the same thing to get

00:00:25.138 --> 00:00:30.246
from 69 to 92. So, you can see that as each day goes by, we're adding 23 wiper

00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:35.266
blade sets to the total number of wiper blade sets that have been made. So,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.925
logically, we do that again when we move from day 4 to day 5. This means we need

00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:46.558
to add 23 to 92 to get the number that belongs in the teal box. 92 plus 23 is

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.514
115. At the end of day 5, 115 wiper blade sets will have been produced in total.
