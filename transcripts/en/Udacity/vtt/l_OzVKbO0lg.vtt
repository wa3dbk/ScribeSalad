00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.440
Now that you have completed your
summary section, let's move forward and

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.780
create your experience section.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.800
Whether it's a full time position or
an intern-ship, you can include it here.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.060
Similar to the ways you fill in your
resume, you should utilize bullet

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.580
point statements to convey your
achievements at each position.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.940
Bullet statements begin with action
verbs and should be one to one and

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.620
a half lines long, focus and
detail in your achievements and

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.560
not just your daily tasks.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.280
Include concrete details
with these statements.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.180
Numerical evidence of
contributions is a plus.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.280
Remember, bullet statements
are simplified phrases.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.510
So avoid using excessive pronouns or
small words.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.750
Finally, aim for a maximum of
four bullet points per section.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.450
Mention your previous job titles,
organizations, and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.326
the time you served at each role.

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:48.840
Add thanks to projects,
videos, photos, and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.910
anything else that relates to your
experience, but be selective.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.039
If you worked at a position many years
ago that isn't relevant any more,

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.710
you don't have to list it.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.100
Sometimes, less is more.
