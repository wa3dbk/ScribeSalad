00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.506
We now have two things added together. We have 4 x times the quantity 2 x plus

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:11.160
5, added to 3 times the quantity 2 x plus 5. Between these two terms, we have a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.058
common factor of 2 x plus 5, so we can start by pulling that outside. And then,

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:22.184
we can multiply that, and then we can rate the things that it multiplies. 4 x

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:27.411
plus 3. So the final factored form of 8 x squared plus 26 x plus 15 is just this

00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:32.453
expression, the quantity 2 x plus 5 times the quantity 4 x plus 3. Awesome.

00:00:32.453 --> 00:00:36.860
Let's check that just to make sure. We multiply 2 x by each of these terms, and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.948
then we multiply 5 by each of these terms. All we need to do now is add like

00:00:40.948 --> 00:00:45.300
terms, and voila, we have verified that this factored form is in fact equal to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.944
the expression we started out with. Awesome.
