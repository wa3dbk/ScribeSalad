00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Everything we've done so far has been pretty limited,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that we had to do the same thing on all data.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We couldn't do anything that really depended on what the data was.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What we're going to do next is figure out a way to make code behave differently

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
based on decisions.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The first thing we're going to do is figure out some ways to make comparisons,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so we have a way to test and decide what we should do.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Python provides lots of different operators for doing comparisons.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There are things similar to what we've used in math.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We have a less than sign that compares 2 numbers.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We have the greater than.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We have a less than or equal to. Things like this...

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
All of these operate on numbers, so we can have a number followed by

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
a comparison operator, followed by another number.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is very similar to the grammar we saw earlier for arithmetic expressions,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but now instead of having a plus or times here,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we can have something that does a comparison.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The output of a comparison though is not a number.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's a Boolean value, and a Boolean value is 1 of 2 things.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's either the value True or the value False.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's see some examples in the Python interpreter.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.815
First, we'll use the less than to compare 2 and 3.

00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:14.000
So 2 is less than 3, so we expect the result to be true.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
When we run this, we see that the result is true.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If we compare a number greater than 3, let's say 21 &lt; 3.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The result will be false.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We can have any expression we want with a comparison,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.950
so we can do 7 * 3 &lt; 21.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.692
When we run that, we also get false because 7 x 3 = 21,

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:36.000
which is not less than 21.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.046
Another comparison operator we can use is not equal to.

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:44.000
So != means not equal to.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.708
So 7 * 3 != 21 is false because 7 x 3 is equal to 21.

00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:56.000
If we want to do equality comparison, we don't use the equal sign,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we use 2 equal signs.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We call that the double equal.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So now we have 7 * 3 == 21, and the result there is true.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now we're going to have a quiz to see if you can figure out why we need to use

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.369
the == here instead of just the single =.

00:02:14.754 --> 00:02:19.000
The question is, why is the equality comparison done using ==,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
having 2 equals, instead of just a single = sign?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The possible answers: Because = means approximately equal,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and we want to do exact equality comparisons.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Because we needed to use 2 characters for the not equal comparison,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and we wanted the equal to be the same length.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Because Guido, the designer of Python, really likes = signs.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Because the single = sign means assignment,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
or it doesn't really matter. We can use either == or =.
