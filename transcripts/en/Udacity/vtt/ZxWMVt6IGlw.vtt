00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.140
The answer is Jonathan grows 50 pixels on each side. Let's see how I figured

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.490
that out. We're back where we left off in BlueJ. I'm calling the grill method

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.350
on the picture of Jonathan and passing 50 and 50, but I'm going to cancel that

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.660
for a moment. Out of curiosity, what is the current width of this picture? Get

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.560
width. It looks like it's 185. So now, if I call the grow method, like I was

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.470
going to do before, Jonathan just got bigger. But how much exactly? It's hard

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.494
to tell whether he grew 50% bigger or 50 pixels on each side bigger? Or, just

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:36.880
50 pixels wider and 50 pixels taller. So, let's check the width again. Get

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.260
width, and now it's 285. So, it looks like the width grew by 100 pixels. If it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.090
were going to grow by 50%, it would probably have grown by about 190 pixels.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.220
So, it sounds to me like it grew 50 pixels this way and 50 pixels this way, and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.730
then did the same up and down.
