00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.820
Let's consider how we can use this
same approach now for stock data.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.660
This is one of our pandas Data Frames
that contains some factors or

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.690
features of stocks, and it's arranged
in the usual way where each column

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.070
represents the value of the feature for
a particular stock.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.930
And time goes downward essentially.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.710
Now we might have many features for
each stock, for

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.910
instance we might have Bollinger Bands,
momentum, PE ratio, and so on.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.540
We represent that by stacking
these one behind the other.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.730
These are our X's.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.730
What is our Y?

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.446
In most cases we want to
use our historical feature

00:00:48.446 --> 00:00:51.486
data to predict a future price.

00:00:51.486 --> 00:00:56.000
But to train our model, we're going to
use historical price as well.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.880
So the value of these factors or
features today we call X and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.390
we like to be able to run that
through the model that we've built and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.160
get Y which is our
predicted future price.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.450
Well, we don't have that model yet,
we've got to learn it.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.430
And we've got to learn it from data.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.060
So here's how we do that.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.040
We roll back time so that we're back in
history here at our first data point.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.155
We look at the values of our features
there, and then we look, say,

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:32.070
5 days into the future to see
what that future price is.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.875
So now we've got a pairing of
these features with that future Y.

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.580
We save that XY pair into our data.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.210
Now remember X can be multi-dimensional.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.940
And that's one instance of data.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.530
We move forward one day.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.500
So we've got a new set of X's and
a new Y.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.065
And we record that in our database.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.100
Eventually, we reach a point
where we can't go any further

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.440
because there's no more Y data.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.120
In other words, if we went one day past
this, Y would be out here in the future.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.870
So we don't have that data to use, and
that means we've got some leftover data.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.210
In any case, we now, for
each of these days in history, have

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.960
a pair of X's and Y's that we can feed
into our database to build our model.
