Who has more shoes, men or women? I asked this question to everyone at Udacity.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.250
If you'd like, you can take the poll yourself and give us more data to work

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.382
with. We're going to do a t-test to see if men or women have more shoes. Our

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:17.547
null hypothesis is that there's no difference. The mean number of shoes owned

00:00:17.547 --> 00:00:22.780
by females, is equal to the mean number of shoes owned by males. Or that the

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.343
difference is 0. Which gender do you think has more shoes? That will determine

00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:32.101
our alternative hypothesis. One alternative hypothesis could be that females

00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:36.394
own less shoes than males. Or that if we subtract the number of shoes owned by

00:00:36.394 --> 00:00:40.540
males by the number of shoes owned by females. We get a negative number. Or

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.005
maybe we think that females own more pairs of shoes than males, in which case

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.030
the difference will be positive, if we go in this direction for the

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.915
subtraction. And if we don't have a guess, then our alternative hypothesis will

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:57.420
be that they're different. The difference is not significantly equal to 0.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.270
Let's go with this alternative. I know a lot of guys who have a lot of shoes.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.680
And I also know a lot of girls that have a lot of shoes.
