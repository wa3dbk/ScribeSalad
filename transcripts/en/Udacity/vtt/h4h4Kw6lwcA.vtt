00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, out of those many choices, I made a choice to say I'm going to represent

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
as a tuple of (here, there, t),

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
where "here" represents everything that's on this side,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
"there" represents everything that's on that side,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and "t" is the total elapsed time since the start.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm going to represent here and there with frozen sets, because those are hashable.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So this collection here would be the frozen set consisting of {1, 2, 5, 10},

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and I'm going to just use the string "light" to represent the flashlight.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There would be the empty frozen set.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, consider this state here representing the start state.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
What are the successors of that state?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, any one of the people could go across.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
They've got to bring the light with them.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
In the successor state, the light will definitely be there, and it will not be here.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It can only be in one place.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
At least one of the people will be over there

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and possibly two of the people,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
so all combinations of sending either one person or two people to the other side,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
those will each be distinct successor states.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Let's see--we've got 4 x 3 is 12, but order doesn't matter, so there's 6 of those.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Then 4 more, so it looks like there should be 10 successor states.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
What I want you to do is write for me the successor function.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We're calling it bsuccessors, because we already had a and we're on to b.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Or b could stand for "bridge."

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Remember that a result of the successor function is the dictionary of state action pairs.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
A state is this (here, there, t) tuple.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Here and there have to be frozen sets.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The frozen sets contained people--1, 2, 5, and 10--

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and/or this light, indicated by the string "light."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Show me the function that will generate all the successors.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Here I've given you a hint of here's a way to break up the state into those three variables.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Then put your code here.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Oh, one more thing I forgot is what are the actions.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Well, let's say that an action will be represented by the character string arrow going to the right

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
if we're moving from here to there and an arrow going to the left

00:02:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
if we're moving from there to here.
