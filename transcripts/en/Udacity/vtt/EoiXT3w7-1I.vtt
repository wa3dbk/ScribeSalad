00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.320
Okay, so here we have our design of the

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.280
classes we are going to build up on the top

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.040
right hand corner, and what I've done thus far is

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.310
created a new Python file, and I called it inheritance.py.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.530
Now, based on our design, I'm going to go ahead

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.320
and create a class called Parent. There. The next

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.370
thing to do is to initialize the variables of class

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.350
Parent, variables like last_name and eye_color. So, to do that,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.500
I will define this class as init method

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.180
or constructor. The first argument for this function,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.365
we know, is self. And the two instance

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:38.040
variables for class Parent, we know, are self.last_name and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.010
self.eye_color. Now the init function we know will

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.150
receive a couple of values as arguments. So, let

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.950
me add them in here, and we will

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.720
use these two arguments to initialize our instance variables.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.160
Let me do that next. Alright. You may notice that this piece of code is pretty

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.610
similar to the code for class Movie that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.300
we have written previously. By the way, one new

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.000
thing I will do here, is add a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.890
quick print statement inside the init method. It will

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.930
print out, Parent Constructor Called. So, this print

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.895
statement will explicitly tell us, each time the init

00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:19.090
method or the constructor of class Parent is called.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.140
Alright, to make sure that this code that we

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.760
have written thus far actually works, let's go ahead

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.000
and use this class. I will define an instance

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.370
of class Parent and call it billy_cyrus, and will

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.530
provide the two arguments that are necessary. The first

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.490
of which is last_name and that happens to be

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.770
Cyrus, and the next one is eye_color which is,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.500
let's say, blue. Now, a quick word

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
of caution. Ordinarily, I would have kept these

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.480
two things, the definition of the class

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.140
Parent and creating its instances. I would have

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.050
kept them in separate Python files. But I have kept them both here in the

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.009
same file for ease of demonstration. Okay, so to demonstrate

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.479
that the instance actually works,

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:15.300
I'll print out its last name. Let me save and then run this file. And

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.450
there's my output. It says the parent constructor

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.290
was called. Which seems appropriate, because we created

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.820
an instance called billy_cyrus. And as soon as

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.260
we did that, the class Parent's _init_ method

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.650
got called, which had a print statement inside

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.780
it. And then, we printed out Billy Cyrus's

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.980
last name, which it printed out correctly. Okay, so far so good.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.640
Now, you'll notice that there really isn't anything new that we've done here

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.100
thus far. The new thing we're going to try is called inheritance, which

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.900
will happen when we create the class called Child. Let's do that next.
