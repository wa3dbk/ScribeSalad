00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.710
Let's suppose that computer A wants to send a

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.790
file to computer B. The file transfer program on

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.150
A asks the file system to read the file

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.390
from the disk. The communication system then sends the

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.990
file, and finally the communication system sends the packets.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.630
On the receiving side, the communication system. Gives the

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.680
file to the file transfer program on B, and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.330
that file transfer program asks to have the file

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.610
written to disk. So what can go wrong in

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.890
this simple file transfer setup? Well first, reading and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.060
writing from the file system can result in errors.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.420
There may be errors in breaking up and reassembling the

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.670
file. And finally there may be errors in the

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.300
communication system itself. Now, one possible solution is to ensure

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.800
that each step has some form of error checking,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.780
such as, duplicate copies, redundancy, time out and retry, so

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.250
forth. One might even do packet error checking

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.380
at each hop of the network. One could send

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.340
every packet three times. One might acknowledge packet reception

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.870
at each hop along the network. But the problem

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.890
is that none of these solutions are complete.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.500
They still require application level checking. Therefore it may

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.030
not be economical to perform redundant checks at different

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.630
layers and at different places of this particular operation.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.810
Another possible solution is an end-to-end check and retry

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.250
where the application commits or retries based on the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.850
check sum of the file. If errors along the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.510
way are rare, this will most likely finish on the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.960
first try. Now, this is not to say that

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.870
we shouldn't take steps to correct errors at any one

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.290
of these stages. Error correction at lower levels can

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.790
sometimes be an effective performance booster. And the trade off

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.670
here is based on performance, not correctness. So

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.170
whether or not one should implement additional correctness

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.680
checks at these layers depends on whether or

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.980
not the amount of effort put into the reliability

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.810
gains are worth the extra trouble. Another example where the intend

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.660
arguement applies is with encryption, where keys are maintained by the end

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.260
applications, and cypher text is generated Before the application sends

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.710
the message across the network. Now one of the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.920
key questions in the end to end argument is

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.550
identifying the ends. The end to end argument says

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.210
that the complexity should be implemented at the ends

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.910
but not in the middle, but the ends may

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.010
vary depending on what the application is. So for

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.500
example, if the application or protocol involves Internet routing,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.410
the ends may be routers, or they might be ISPs.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.810
If the application or protocol is a transport

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.600
protocol, the ends might be end hosts. So, identifying

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.480
the ends in the end-to-end argument is always

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.540
a thorny question that you have to answer first.
