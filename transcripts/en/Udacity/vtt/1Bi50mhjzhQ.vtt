00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.960
Let's look at the solution
to our Raid4 quiz.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.790
We have a Raid4 array with five disks.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.980
And one disk has 200 GB in capacity.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.340
The data capacity of the array is
the data capacity of all but one disk.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.970
Because we sacrifice
a single disk to parity.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.440
So among the five disks one is
parity the other ones contain data.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.680
So we have four times this
much which is 800 gigabytes.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.110
The throughput of the array for

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.570
reads is going to be the throughput
of the four data disks.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.050
So we have 40 megabytes per
second throughput for reads.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.980
But for writes, it's going to be half
a throughput of a single disk and that's

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.150
because the parity disk need to be
both read and written for every write.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.910
So, we get five megabytes
per second here.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.860
So now we need to figure out
what happens during one second.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.430
Well, this throughput is eight
times the throughput of the writes.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.260
Which means in every
given second one-ninth

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.500
of a second will be spent on reads.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.560
And eight-ninths of a second
will be spent on writes.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.380
That way we spent eight times as
much time on writes as we do for

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.370
reads, which allows us to do
the same number of reads and writes.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.585
So now the overall throughput
will be what we can read in

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:35.280
one-ninth of a second plus what we can
write in eight-ninths of a second.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.530
And that ends up being
80 over 9 megabytes.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.240
So this is what we can do in a second.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.930
So our average throughput ends up
being 8.89 megabytes per second.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.670
Again, just like in our Raid1 quiz, we
cannot simply average the throughput for

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.920
reads and the throughputs for writes.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.190
We would get something more than 20
megabytes a second if we do that.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.010
But that would do a lot more reads than
writes, because it assumes that half

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.000
a second we are reading, and
we managed to read 20 megabytes, and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.760
then half a second we are writing,
and managed to write 2.5 megabytes.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.770
As you can see, the read to
write ratio is not 50/50 here.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.310
So that is, again, why, we get this, and
not just a simple average of these two.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.160
So the final question
here is what's the MTTF?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.040
We know that the MTTF of RAID4 is
equal to the MTTF of 1 disk squared

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:42.570
divided by N, times N-1 times the time
it takes us to replace a disk.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.730
Our N in this case is 5 so
we get 5 x 4 times the s.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.190
And in this expression
again this is the time

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.280
that we get to work with the full RAID4
array until we have a failed disk.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.790
And this is how many times we
survived the repair without

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.750
the second disk failing.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.680
The overall number is
20,833,333.33 hours,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.500
which, again, much better than this.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.140
And we already said that this
is about 11 to 12 years.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.650
This is more then 2,000 years.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.716
Remember that our RAID1 had 20,000
years, so this is significantly worse

00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:30.240
than RAID1, but on the other hand we
are working with 5 disks here and

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.140
spending only one-fifth of
our capacity on parity.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.510
With Raid 1,
we were working with only two disks, and

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.140
spending half of the capacity
of the array on parity.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.440
So we sacrifice some MTTF to
get better cost per gigabyte.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.550
But we still achieve a very,
very high MTTF.
