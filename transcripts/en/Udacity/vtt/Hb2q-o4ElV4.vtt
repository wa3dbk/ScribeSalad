00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.901
All right, so let's look at the first one. We have our sample mean, x bar minus

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:13.204
the z score times the standard deviation meaning we have this number of standard

00:00:13.204 --> 00:00:22.445
deviations less than the mean. And that's what we did with z here being 1.96,

00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:29.073
since this is 95%. And then over here on the other side, we have our sample mean

00:00:29.073 --> 00:00:35.170
plus z amounts of standard deviations or standard errors. So this is what we did

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.106
to find the confidence interval. However we did not subtract Z standard

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:46.006
deviations from the population mean. Remember the original population mean was

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:51.190
point zero seven, seven, If we did that then we would get a confidence interval

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.092
for the original population mean. And that's not what we're interested in. This

00:00:56.092 --> 00:01:02.581
third one, we have our sample mean, minus and instead of Z we have the actual Z

00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:10.024
value, 1.96 times the standard error. So we have 1.96 standard errors less than

00:01:10.024 --> 00:01:16.203
this sample mean. So that is what we get. And same with over here we have 1.96

00:01:16.203 --> 00:01:21.556
standard error plus the sample mean. And this one doesn't really make sense

00:01:21.556 --> 00:01:26.868
because we can't just subtract the number of standard deviations, we need to

00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:32.180
multiply this number of standard deviations by what the standard deviation

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.226
actually is. To find the distance away from the sample mean we need to go.

00:01:37.226 --> 00:01:40.373
Hopefully that makes sense. Great job.
