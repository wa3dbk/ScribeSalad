00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And of course, the correct answer for the mean

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is to sum up all the data and divide it by the number of data items.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So you use the command sum(data)

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
divided by len(data)--realize that inside the function this thing is called data.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Then if we plug in data 1, the specific data sequence, into the function,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and we go and hit the run button, we get 54.4 as an answer.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That's the correct mean.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So if you got this right,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you wrote an interesting piece of software already.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now if you have lots of programming experience, this was trivial,

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but if you're new to programming, it's actually quite remarkable.
