00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.490
You're now prepared to start tackling
some more serious programming.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.285
Remember that setting up your work space
is also setting yourself up for success.

00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:11.632
&gt;&gt; Of course, this setup is just
a suggestion about how you can organize

00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:16.350
your work space, and there are plenty of
other tools and techniques you can use.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.041
Feel free tp experiment to
find out what works for you.

00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:21.381
If you think it might
benefit other students,

00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:23.790
post about your setup in
the discussion forum.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.430
&gt;&gt; And now on to stage two to write
your first computer programs in Python.
