00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.740
The visitor count for a small doctor's office today would

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.380
be relatively small. So, we can probably get away with

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.690
an int, and we would write that as 123. The

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.390
number of gallons used could be pretty much anything. We

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.540
don't know what it's being used for, so it could

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.230
be two or 2 million. It probably doesn't have to

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.530
be an integer. You could have 2.5 gallons of water.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.590
So, this should be a double, and we could write it

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.830
as 123 point or 1.23E2. Either one of these would

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.680
work for initializing this variable. PageViews, or the number of pages

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.030
of a website viewed by users this quarter, could be a

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.920
very large number. Think about how many YouTube videos get watched.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.780
But it has to be an integer number because it's a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.360
count. So I would use a long. And when you initialize

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.590
a long, you would use something like 123L. Half-life, a measure

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.900
of how long it takes a signal from a radioactive oxygen

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.430
isotope to decrease by half is another double. There's nothing to guarantee

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.018
that this would be another integer value. We could initialize this again

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:05.209
using 123 point or 1.23E2. And for this case, and also the

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.920
gallons case, we could have just written 123. That would work as well.
