00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.167
I'm John Owens.

00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:04.340
I'm an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Davis,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.336
where I lead a group of amazing graduate students in exploring the frontiers of GPU computing.

00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:13.758
And I'm Dave Luebke. I'm a Senior Director of Research at Nvidia where I study 3D graphics,

00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:17.511
and I've been working with John and others for many years on expanding the reach of GPUs.

00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:20.354
This class focuses on parallel computing on the GPU.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.269
You'll learn about both the hardware and the software on the modern GPU,

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.683
and get to work with high end GPUs as you develop a set of image processing tools during the assignments,

00:00:28.683 --> 00:00:33.112
such as those that you might find in cool applications such as Photoshop or Instagram.

00:00:33.112 --> 00:00:35.318
We think that projects will be both interesting and fun.

00:00:35.318 --> 00:00:38.405
But most important, you'll learn how to think about computing in a parallel way.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.067
Thinking in parallel is a crucial skill,

00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:45.239
maybe even the crucial skill as you approach challenging problems in all areas of computing.

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.061
All right. So let's get started.
