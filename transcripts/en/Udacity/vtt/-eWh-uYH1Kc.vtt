00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this homework you're going to be asked to write a grammar that will allow us

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to write a parser for the JSON language.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
JSON is a data interchange language for JavaScript that allows JavaScript programs

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to pass values back and forth and pass them on to other programs.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What I'm asking you to do is to write this grammar.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You can look at JSON.org to see the definition.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
There is a little grammar there on the right-hand side.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's not quite in the right format that we expect here,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so you're going to have to translate it into the right format.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Then you should be able to parse.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
A top level is called a value in JSON.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You should be able to parse that with your grammar.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Here I've given you some examples that you can test out to see if they make sense.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
See if you can translate the JSON grammar into our format,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and see how easy that is.
