00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.080
The first refactoring we're going to see is the collapse hierarchy

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.340
refactoring. When a software system undergoes a number of changes, over

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.730
time the collapse hierarchy may become, let's say, sub-optimal. There are

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.300
several refactorings that address this

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.200
issue for example, refactorings that allow

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.900
you to move methods and fields up and down the class

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.360
hierarchy. So what happens when you apply a number of these

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.360
refactorings, is that a subclass might become too similar to its

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.878
superclass and might not be adding much value to the system.

00:00:25.878 --> 00:00:28.010
In this case, it is a good idea to merge

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.300
the classes together. That's exactly what the Collapse Hierarchy refactoring

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.600
does. Imagine, for instance, that we have two classes: employee

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.210
and salesman. And that salesman is just so similar to

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.380
employee that it does not make sense to keep them

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.870
separated. In this case, you could merge the two classes,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.730
so that at the end of the refactoring, only employee

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.070
is left. And the resulting structure of the system is improved.
