00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.510
Now that we know each phase must
increase the length of the shortest

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.870
augmenting path by at least two.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.850
We are now ready to bound
the number of phases.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.450
Specifically, the number of
phases used by Hopcroft- karp

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.720
is Order square root of V.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.800
Note that the trivial bound saying
that there can be only one phase

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.000
per possible augmenting path
link isn't good enough.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.260
That would still leave us
with an order V bound.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.840
In reality, we will have a phase for
length 1, for length 3, probably for

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.880
length 5, maybe not for
length 7, and so forth.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.360
But as we consider greater and

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.370
greater possible phase lengths,
the ones for which for

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.670
which we will actually have augmenting
phases gets sparser and sparser.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.340
The key argument will be that after
roughly square root of V phases,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.500
the path length will be at
least square root of V.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.900
And that then will imply that we only
have square root of V phases left.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.950
To fill out the argument,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.440
we'll let M prime be the matching
found by Hopcroft- karp.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.470
And we'll let M be the matching after
the ceiling of the square root of the V

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.840
phases.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.850
Because each phase increased
the shortest augmenting path by 2,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.670
the length of the shortest
augmenting path in M

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.017
is at least twice the square
root of V plus 1.

00:01:15.017 --> 00:01:18.620
And hence, no path in the symmetric
difference between M and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.130
M prime that is augmenting for
M can have shorter length.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.270
This implies that they're at most the
size of V divided by this shortest path

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.360
length, augmenting paths for
M in this symmetric difference here.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270
We just run out of vertices,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.810
there aren't enough left to fill
out any more paths than this.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.250
And if there can be only so
many augmenting paths in the difference,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.960
then M can't be too
far away from M prime.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.150
Certainly, at most the square root of V.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.810
Hence, M will only be augmented
square root of V more times,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.030
meaning that there can't be more than
the square root of V more phases.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.910
We have square root of V phases to make
all the augmenting paths long enough.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.270
So that there can be only square root
of V possible more augmentations,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.449
and that completes the theorem.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.450
Overall then, we've just shown that
Hopcroft- karp finds a maximum matching

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.760
in time Order E times
the square root of V.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.600
We only had square root of V phases.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.150
And each phase, because of the clever
way we were able to reuse the level

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.620
graph, only ends up using Order E time.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.240
And this result is
actually the best known.
