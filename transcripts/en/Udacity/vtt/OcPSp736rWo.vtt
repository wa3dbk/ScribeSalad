00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.310
Once you know where you intend to
distribute your app, you can design for

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.520
localization.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.510
Planning early is key as you need to
consider the space and locations for

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.790
each language.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.490
You can reuse your default layout
if you build a flexible UI.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.840
The key to this is to allow elements
to expand horizontally and vertically.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.850
And also to leave about 30%
more space than you need for

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.470
your default language, so the
translations will have plenty of room.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.010
If you need an alternative layout,
though, you can tag it with the relevant

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.450
qualifiers so that the resource
framer can find it automatically.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.770
But, using the mini alternative
layouts will be harder to maintain.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.890
So you'll need to determine
what's best for your app.
