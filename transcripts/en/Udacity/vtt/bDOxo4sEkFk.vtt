Okay, now that you're storing
the list of users who are shopping,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.210
can you make the information visible
to anyone looking at the list?

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.500
Here I'm looking at the active
list details activity screen, and

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.220
right around here I'd like you to
say who's in the store shopping.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.260
I'll send over spec right
now with more details.
