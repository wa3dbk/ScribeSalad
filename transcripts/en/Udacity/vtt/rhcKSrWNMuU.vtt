00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
And the answer here is that the weight of the tree is always smaller

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.280
than the length of the shortest tour.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.650
And the reason for that is the following: When you have a shortest tour

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.240
for a given graph, then you can always transform the shortest tour

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.790
into a spanning tree because the shortest tour visits each vertex at least once,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.070
so the connectedness is given.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.610
But, of course, a shortest tour always contains at least 1 cycle

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.900
because you have to get back to the vertex where you started from.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.490
So you  have to remove at least 1 edge from the shortest tour in order to make it a spanning tree.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.380
And then you have a spanning tree with a weight that is

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.060
definitely less than the length of the shortest tour,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.060
because you have removed at least 1 edge.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.670
And now here, you even have a minimum spanning tree,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.780
so the weight of the minimum spanning tree must be even smaller.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.760
And that is why the weight of the minimum spanning tree

00:00:46.760 --> 99:59:59.000
is smaller than the length of the shortest tour.
