00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.060
Whoa.
We made a prototype.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.880
It gave us information we needed.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.980
Well done prototype.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.410
You rock.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.430
Unfortunately, as we said at
the beginning of this lesson,

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.720
prototypes should exist for
exactly as long as they are needed, and

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.685
we don't need you anymore.

00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:19.886
[SOUND] And, we're done.

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:22.889
Now that we've gotten feedback on
the overall structure of the app,

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.028
we'll go into Envision,

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:27.410
getting a deeper input from Jonathon
on how to make interactive prototypes.
