00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.650
For this problem, we're going to look at the relationships between

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.190
different kinds of graphs. We want to know if x

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.170
is the subset of y or y is the subset

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.610
of x or both or neither. We'd select this first

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.930
option. If every star graph is also a tree graph,

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.130
we pick this option. If every tree graph is also

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.240
a star graph, select this option, if both of these

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.370
are true; if every star graph is a tree graph and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.350
every tree graph is a star graph. Or we'd pick this option, if neither is true.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.690
For example, the first one is true. Every

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.110
star graph is a tree graph. In order to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.020
get from any node, exist this simple path

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.000
through the center. To our target node. If we

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.290
start from the center, it's trivially easy to

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.420
get to any node. The reverse is not true.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.040
This is an example of a tree graph that is not a star

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.980
graph. Here are the rest of the graph types for you to figure out.
