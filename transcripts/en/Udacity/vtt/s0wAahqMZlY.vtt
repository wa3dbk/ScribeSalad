00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For this problem, we'll look at the Russian multiplication algorithm.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's say we're computing russian(63, 12).

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's pause the execution at some point where we have x = 7, z = 84,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and we want to know what y equals.
