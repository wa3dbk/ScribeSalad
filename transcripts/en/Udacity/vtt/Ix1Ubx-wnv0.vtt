00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.926
The answer is 0. The graph of y equals x squared plus one doesn't touch the x

00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:09.850
axis at all. Let's take a peek at the graph. So here is a beautiful graph of y

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.970
equals x squared plus one, you can see that the lowest point on the parabola is

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.561
above the x axis. So, the fact that X squared plus 1 doesn't have any real

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:24.174
linear factors means that its graph doesn't intersect the X axis. This is a

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:28.879
great example of a lot of the things we've been talking about in this lesson.
