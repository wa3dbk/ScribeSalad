00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.009
In the case of pipe and filter,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.360
we break the system into independently
executing components called filters.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.700
The filters are connected
together using a FIFO, or

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.480
first in first out queue, and
these queues are called pipes.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.290
So we have pipes connecting
together the filters.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.010
Each of the filters is going to take
a single input, which has become

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.160
called the standard input, and
it's going to produce a single output,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.480
which has now been called
the standard output.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.900
The filters share the assumptions
that the inputs and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.240
output consist of sequential files
containing lines of ASCII characters.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.190
Can you think of a situation
where you have a pipeline of

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.205
filter components where it's non-ASCII?

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.140
&gt;&gt; I mean,
I guess you could pipe together

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.400
Linux processes that have binary output,
but.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.991
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but what-
&gt;&gt; Useful.

00:00:55.991 --> 00:00:57.551
&gt;&gt; Well, okay.

00:00:57.551 --> 00:00:59.338
&gt;&gt; In terms of, like, a user interface,

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:01.920
you wouldn't be seeing
anything that might be useful.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.670
&gt;&gt; Well, it turns out that in
doing image processing, okay,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.150
you put various filters along the way to
deal with the processing of the images.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.130
Also in situations where there's
sensor data and you want to filter out

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.960
noise of certain kinds or select
certain frequency bands and so on.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.230
It's binary data, but
it's going through a filtering process.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.970
So although this does work in other
situations, it's most familiar and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.859
most used in situations
where there's text files.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.280
So as you've indicated, there's going to
be filters having to do with circular

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.540
shifting, and alphabetizing, and reading
things in and putting things out.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.840
And one of the essential elements of
this particular approach to solving

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.910
things is there's no common
data storage elements.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.030
We're just passing
the solution along as we go.
