00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.542
Now, the key is we weren't really solving for x here. We know x equals 2 the

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:10.455
4th, or 16. We wanted to convert this to logarithmic form. So we'll use the

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:16.418
base of 2, will be the base of our logarithm. So log base 2 of x equals 4, our

00:00:16.418 --> 00:00:21.510
exponent. If you always remember that this base becomes the base of the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.148
logarithm. And that this power becomes the answer to our logarithm, then you

00:00:26.148 --> 00:00:30.975
you know that this must be the argument of the logarithm. This is the number

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:36.892
that we take the logarithm of. So 2 to the fourth equals x is the same thing as

00:00:36.892 --> 00:00:40.643
log base 2 of x equal to 4.
