If we were designing the coffee maker as a whole and not just the software

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.820
controllers for it, we would now spec out each of the devices we just listed.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.790
Fortunately, the hardware team has taken care of that task and

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.720
we have been given a Java API for the hardware. The API is available to

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.790
you from the class resources page. It comprises methods and constant values.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.730
The methods provide a way of determining the status of the hardware device and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.850
to change them as requested. The constants give symbolic names to the inner,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.370
to integer values that, are needed by the controllers. Note that

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.030
Robert Martin wrote this example before enums were added to the Java language.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.910
So he had to define them using the integer constants himself.
