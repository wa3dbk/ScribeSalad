00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right, let's see if we can solve this problem. We're looking for our four clique.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, four clique is going to have to have the property that each of the nodes is connected

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to each of the other nodes, so the alt degree or the degree of the node has to be at least 3.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So that actually means we can eliminate some of these edges from the graph. All right.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So the nodes from this graph. Two can't be part of our four clique because two only has a degree of 2.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So let's get rid of that guy. All right. We can device same argument.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We can get rid of 6 because it only has a degree of 2. All right.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now, everybody that's left has degree at least 3. Let's take a look at node 4.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So node 4 has the property that it has exactly line of degree of 3.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So if four is part of the clique, then it's neighbors have to be the rest of the clique, 1, 3 and 8,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but you noticed that 1 and 8 are not connected to each so 4 can't be part of our four clique.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
All right, now that we've taken those edges away, we can see 8 has now a degree of 2.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So 8 can't be part of the four clique, so the only possibility left is that these four nodes

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
make up a four clique and that would mean 1 needs to be connected to 3, 5 and 7,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
3 needs to be connected to 5 and 7, and 5 needs to be connected to 7, which it is.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So if we add these node numbers together, 7+3+5+1 is 16.
