00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.560
If you open up the GIF preview of your
controller in the Objective C Project,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.210
you'll see the method sharegif.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.890
If you built the app meme,

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.260
this code may look very similar to
the code you used to share a meme.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.010
Notice that the GIF is being
sent as an NSData object.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.580
And that the NSData object is
being initialized from the GIF

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.322
objects url property.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:27.220
The ActivityViewController is being
initialized with an array of activity

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.740
items which includes just one item,
the animated GIF.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.500
The completion handler is being set so

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.810
that if the activity is completed we
return to the RootViewController,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.960
which right now is
the welcome view controller.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.570
The ActivityViewController
is presented modally.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.980
Recreate this functionality in Swift and

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.980
then move on to compare your
implementation to the sample code.
