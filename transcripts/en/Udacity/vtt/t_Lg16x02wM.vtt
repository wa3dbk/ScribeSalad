00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.580
The template property now holds
the result of compiling the template.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.120
Which means that this is a function and

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.690
now it's just waiting to
be called with some data.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.050
That happens right here, so
let's add a break point and

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.070
refresh the page to see how it works.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.530
The template function is called
with the model's attributes.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.320
We can step into this function call
by clicking on this button here.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.330
This takes us back to underscore, back
to the function that we just build up.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.900
Data is the information for
the menu item.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.260
Remember that render is
the function that we've built up in

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.580
the previous video.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.230
The render function is called and
the model's data is passed to it.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.080
Let's step in to render and
see what's going on.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.740
We are now inside the function that was
constructed from the HTML template.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.500
It looks a little complicated but
here's the start of the TD and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.270
here is its closing tag.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.700
The content of the TD will be an empty
string if the property is missing, or

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.690
it will be the property itself.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.600
So these lines all form one big string
and are stored in p, then p is returned.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.510
We can check p on the console
to see what is being returned or

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.500
we can see what this
function returns over here.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.070
Returning from this function
takes us back to template and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.960
from here we go back to App dot JS.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.930
Finally after its long arduous journey
the template that's now populated with

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.540
data is inserted into this element.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.620
Wow, all of that to compile and render
a template, before we leave underscore,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.880
I need to mention one more
thing about variables and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.610
the way they're referenced in templates.
