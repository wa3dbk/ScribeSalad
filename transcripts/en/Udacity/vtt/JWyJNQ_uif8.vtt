A common misperception of
Google Analytics is that it's

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.340
a web-only solution.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.380
This is not the case.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.320
We've made huge strides in the last
year to make it very mobile friendly.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.699
In fact, you'll start to see stats that
are very specific to mobile data within

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.135
the in the user interface.

00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:17.025
So I think right now the big thing
is that because Google analytics

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:18.765
has always been known as a web tool.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:21.075
People don't really think to use it for
mobile apps.

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:24.025
But there's a whole section of
learning on our website today.

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:25.365
To learn more about
how we can help them.
