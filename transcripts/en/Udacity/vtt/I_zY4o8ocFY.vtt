00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.980
So before we go on to the next major computer

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.900
science topic we're going to introduce. I want to give you

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.980
one more quiz, to see if you can write a python

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.660
expression that's going to give you some idea how fast a

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.200
computer executes. So your goal for this quiz is to write

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.210
some python code that will print out how far light travels

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.100
in one nanosecond. Let me give you some information that will

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.820
help with this. So, the speed of light is 299,792,458 meters

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.500
per second. So, almost 300 million.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.870
One meter is 100 centimeters. One nanosecond is one billionth of a second.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.653
Which is 1 divided by 1000 000 000.

00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:47.249
So, your goal is to compute how far light travels in one nanosecond,

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.903
and to get that answer in centimeters. And I don't want this to be

00:00:50.903 --> 00:00:54.180
an algebra quiz. So, all you need to do is multiply

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.840
these three values together, and you'll get the answer we want.
