00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.997
Lucid dreaming is being conscientiously aware that you're dreaming. So, how can

00:00:03.997 --> 00:00:07.910
we lucid dream? Well, Steven L'Burg, an expert in the field, says that lucid

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.260
dreamers actually develop a mindset that allows them to recognize that they're

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.912
dreaming. And once they recognize that they're dreaming they can actually

00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:17.908
change the content of their dream.

00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:22.614
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's right and proponents of lucid dreaming tell a variety of benefits. For

00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:27.150
example, in one pilot study, they looked at an individual who had nightmares.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.222
And the idea was, if you could teach the person to lucid dream and become aware

00:00:30.222 --> 00:00:33.438
when they're having a nightmare, they could actually change the outcome of that

00:00:33.438 --> 00:00:38.820
dream. In this example, the person did actually experience fewer nightmares,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.065
although the mechanism of action, or how it happened still remains unclear.

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:46.278
There are lots of great tips and tricks on how to engage lucid dreaming, and I

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:50.978
really suggest that you try. I myself have been able to lucid dream on a few

00:00:50.978 --> 00:00:55.950
occasions. It usually happens when I have this dream that I'm chewing glass.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.070
For some reason, I'm able to realize that I wouldn't chew glass in real life.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.170
And it's at this point that I usually wake up, however some people have been

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.320
able to lucid dream such that they're able to change the content and even fly

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.102
away.

00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:10.667
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's really cool Susan. I'm really glad you don't eat glass when you're

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:11.460
awake. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.404
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's good but now that I have you here why don't we move on to the drugs and

00:01:14.404 --> 00:01:18.382
consciousness part of this lesson since that is area of expertise?

00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:22.016
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That sounds great Lauren, but first we have to say, or define what is a drug.
