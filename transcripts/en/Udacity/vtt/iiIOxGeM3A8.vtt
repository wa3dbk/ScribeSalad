00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now I want the plus/minus term, the two-sided confidence interval

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
at a confidence level of 95%.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is the number we can add or subtract to the mean,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so that at 95% confidence the true mean lies within the interval.

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please enter it here.
