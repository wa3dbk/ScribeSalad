00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.330
So we've learned that we can keep
our players coming back to our game

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.560
by creating some friendly competition.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.630
But we also need to make
our game easy to return to.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.270
Why don't you tell us
more about that yet?

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
say I've been playing Angry Birds for

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.700
a while on my phone and
I get all the way to level 30.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.310
Then when I get home I switch
to my tablet to play and

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.550
I have to start all over at level one.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.040
&gt;&gt; That's so frustrating.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.620
I'd probably quit the game then.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.470
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
And so would a lot of people.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.220
So it's really important to have the
same progress across all your devices.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.350
&gt;&gt; A simple solution to this
problem is to save your data

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.960
across all your devices in the Cloud.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.910
So how would a game developer do that?

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.220
&gt;&gt; Well there are number of tools
out there that allow a developer to

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.330
link to the cloud.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.590
For example, Amazon's dispersing for
game gives you the ability to sync your

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.160
game progress, scores, and
much more across all your cloud devices.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.260
&gt;&gt; Let's learn more about this.
