I think it needs to know the persons name, and the persons friends. If it

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.950
stores the names of all the friends, it'll be able to give us back that

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.080
information. A person should also store its own name. We can add other

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.480
interesting facts to the Person object like where they work, or their favorite

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.040
restaurants. But for now just to do these methods, we're going to keep it

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.380
simple. If you feel like customizing your Person class once we've got the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.793
basics working, go wild.
