00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.750
So computer architecture is about building future

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.210
computers, and let's see how it interacts with

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.780
technology trends. So, progress in computer manufacturing technology

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.508
is very fast. So if we design with

00:00:13.508 --> 00:00:16.574
current technology and using the parts we already

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:18.691
have for a computer, by the time we

00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:21.465
design the new computer, we have an obsolete

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:25.302
new computer. Why? Well because, by the time

00:00:25.302 --> 00:00:28.404
we have designed it with current technology and parts,

00:00:28.404 --> 00:00:31.770
the technology and the pieces for computers have improved,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.014
so what we have is something that is using

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:38.346
obsolete technology and obsolete components. So we must anticipate

00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:41.495
future technology and what will be available, and then

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:44.175
when we design computer that way, we get future

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:48.061
computers that actually use the most advanced technology available

00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:50.950
at that time. But how do we do that?

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.070
We must be aware of technology trends. That is, how do we expect technology to

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.420
change in the future, and what do we expect to be available in the future?
