00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.520
So now our page has the correct layout.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.280
But we need to make sure that our page looks good on all size screens,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.100
not just this big one.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.170
So let's go ahead and resize it.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.060
You can see it gets smaller.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.800
And as we get closer and closer to the mobile size,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.070
we can see that this image is being pushed off the side of the screen.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.670
I'll go ahead and make it big again.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.410
It's important to make sure that our websites look good on mobile too.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.030
So, we need to make some changes using Bootstrap.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.350
Look through the Bootstrap documentation to answer this question.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.580
Which class should you apply to images to make them resize automatically?

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.350
