00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.106
Try out your updated app
if you haven't already.

00:00:08.132 --> 00:00:12.440
You'll need to wait a while for the data
to show up in the Analytics dashboard.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.450
But don't forget, you can always check
the logs to see if the hits got sent,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.140
if your phone or
tablet is connected to Android Studio.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.484
In the Analytics dashboard,

00:00:24.484 --> 00:00:31.090
go to Conversions &gt; Ecommerce &gt;
Shopping Analysis &gt; Shopping Behavior.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.005
And make sure the date range
is set as you want it to be.

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:39.044
So, now we see that some of
the sessions include Check-Out,

00:00:39.044 --> 00:00:42.170
let's confirm in
the Checkout Behavior page.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.959
Drum roll please.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.245
And we see that we had some sessions
with step one of Check-Out.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.490
Step one implies maybe there's a step
two and actually there can be, and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.790
I'm going to talk more
about Check-Out steps soon.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.470
Also notice there are no transactions,
and

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.550
that's because a transaction
involves money changing hands.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.980
Or more technically speaking,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.980
a transaction requires a product
action to be action_purchase,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.680
or action_refund.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.250
We'll be getting to transactions next.
