00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
The answer here is almost depressing.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.119
Now we can handle a maximum input size of 36 even though we have a 100 times speedup,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.260
and the argument is basically the same as before.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.720
Again, you compare this number her for n=30 to this number here

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.160
and then see when this one gets larger than this one over here.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.050
And that is why it's so important to understand algorithms and improve algorithms

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.620
because if you do any optimizations that are a constant factor even if it's a huge constant factor,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.460
it doesn't really increase the performance of your algorithm

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.930
if you're dealing with exponential time algorithms.

00:00:35.930 --> 99:59:59.000
So you really have to dive down and understand your algorithm and then improve it.
