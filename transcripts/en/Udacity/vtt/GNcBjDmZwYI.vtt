00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.540
Let's look at the solution
to our False Sharing Quiz.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.930
We have two blocks, a block that has A,
B, C, and D in it, and

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.870
a block that has X, Y, Z, and W in it.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.910
We're looking for which of these,
if any, have false sharing misses.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.100
So let's first look at this one.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.870
There is a read X and a write X.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.650
The first will be a miss.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.950
The second will also be a miss.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.870
Both of these are compulsory misses.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.520
X wasn't in C0's cache.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.240
X wasn't in C1's cache, so
they have to be compulsory misses.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.910
Read A here is also a compulsory miss.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.780
This block wasn't in C2's cache.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.030
Finally, C3 is writing to B.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.650
This block wasn't in C3's cache so
this also a compulsory miss.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.220
So in fact, this sequence has
no coherence misses whatsoever.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.462
All of them are compulsory misses.

00:01:00.462 --> 00:01:02.290
Now let's look here.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.849
This is a compulsory miss for C0.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.060
This is a compulsory miss for C1.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.270
This is a compulsory miss for C2.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.670
And this is a compulsory miss to C3.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.810
So regardless,
whether we had coherence or

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.510
not, these four accesses
would be misses because

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.730
each of these caches needs to fetch
the block for the first time.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.490
So there are no coherence
misses in this sequence either.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.960
Now, let's look here.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.032
C0 reads X.

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:36.429
C1 writes to X.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.965
This invalidates X in C0.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:46.283
This invalidation needs to happen
in order for X to be written in C1.

00:01:46.283 --> 00:01:49.330
C2 now writes to W.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.280
That invalidates the data in C1's cache.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.460
The data in C0's cache was already
invalidated at that point.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.000
When C0 tries to read X, the reason
it doesn't have the data in its cache

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.639
is because C1 invalidated it, and
C1 was accessing the same word.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.580
So this is an example of true sharing.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.360
We got invalidated because somebody
was trying to write the same word

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.090
that we were accessing.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.340
So this is actually a sequence
of three compulsory misses,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.750
followed by a true
sharing coherence miss.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.900
So in this sequence there is
also no false sharing, so

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.060
none of these should have been selected.
