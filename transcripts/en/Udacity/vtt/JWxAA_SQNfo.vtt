Did you get the closed interval from negative 1 to 1? If so, you should be very

00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:08.175
proud of yourself. I know I am. Let's see how we got that solution. Remember

00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:12.353
when you're working with a compound inequality that's written in this form, we

00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:16.495
can perform operations as long as we do the same operation, to all three

00:00:16.507 --> 00:00:21.075
portions of the quation. The first thing I want to do is to get rid of this

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:26.090
fraction by multiplying through by the least common denominator, and the least

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:31.115
common denominator is 2. When I multiply 2 by negative 3, I get negative 6. When

00:00:31.127 --> 00:00:35.890
I multiply 2 by 5 x minus 1 over 2, I'm simply left with 5 x minus 1, and when I

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:40.386
multiply 2 times 2, I get 4. Next I'm going to add 1 to each part of the

00:00:40.398 --> 00:00:45.776
equation so I can isolate the variable in the middle. When I do that, negative 6

00:00:45.788 --> 00:00:50.937
plus 1 is negative 5, and 4 plus 1 is positive 5. Now I can divide through by 5.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.073
Negative 5 divided by 5 is negative 1, less than or equal to x, less than or

00:00:56.085 --> 00:01:00.922
equal to 5 over 5 is positive 1. Let's draw that on the number line. This

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:06.027
portion of the inequality says that negative 1 is less than or equal to x, which

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.894
is the same as x is greater than or equal to negative 1. So, that means we're

00:01:10.906 --> 00:01:13.521
going to be going in that direction.

00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:18.436
This portion of the equation says x is less than or equal to positive 1, so we

00:01:18.448 --> 00:01:23.444
use a square bracket and the answer's going here. So we have the interval from

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:26.092
negative 1 to 1 using the square brackets.
