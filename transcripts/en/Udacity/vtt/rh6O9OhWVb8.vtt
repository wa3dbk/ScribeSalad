00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.460
So, let's look at Litte's Law for GPUs.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.481
To recap, Litte's Law states that the number of useful bytes delivered

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:10.952
is equal to the average latency of memory transaction times the bandwidth.

00:00:10.952 --> 00:00:13.496
Now, what are some implications of this?

00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:19.596
First of all, there's a minimum latency to take a signal or piece of data all the way from an SM

00:00:19.596 --> 00:00:26.967
to somewhere on the DRAM, or to take information from the DRAM and pull it into an SM.

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:30.413
Okay, you can find the details for your particular GPU online,

00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:34.993
but in general any DRAM transaction is going to take hundreds of clock cycles.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:39.196
And by the way, this isn't a GPU thing. This is true of all modern processors.

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:45.006
A clock cycle on a modern chip takes half a nanosecond, for example, on a 2 gigahertz chip.

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.506
And even the speed of light--you know, light doesn't go very far in half a nanosecond.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:52.895
And electricity is even slower, especially on the tiny wires that you find in computer chips.

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:56.314
So to go from somewhere inside the GPU off the chip,

00:00:56.314 --> 00:01:00.904
over a wire somewhere on the board into the DRAM, get a result,

00:01:00.904 --> 00:01:05.090
go all the way back, hundreds and hundreds of clock cycles, many, many nanoseconds.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.227
So this means that a thread that's trying to read or write global memory

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:12.831
is going to have to wait 100s of clocks, and time that it could otherwise

00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:15.836
be spending by doing actual computation.

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:19.662
And this, in turn, is why we have so many threads in flight.

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.891
We deal with this high latency hundreds of clocks between

00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:28.596
memory accesses by having many, many threads that are able to run at any one time,

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:32.461
so after one thread requests a piece of data from global memory

00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:38.033
or initiates a store to global memory, another thread can step in and do some computation.
