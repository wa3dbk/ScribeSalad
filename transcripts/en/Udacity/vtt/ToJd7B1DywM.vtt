00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.980
So what are these benchmarks? They are programs

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.040
and input data that users or companies have

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.350
agreed upon will be used for performance measurement.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.150
So pretty much either a consortium of companies meets

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.990
and decides that these are the programs and

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.290
input data that we will use for performance

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.137
measurements. Or a group of people, who is

00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:25.640
concerned about some performance issue, will design programs and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.800
data and allow others to measure performance on

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.644
that type of a problem using those programs

00:00:31.644 --> 00:00:35.041
and input data. Usually we don't have just

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:38.429
one benchmark program, we have a benchmark suite,

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.663
it consists of multiple programs along with their

00:00:41.663 --> 00:00:45.190
input data. Each of these programs is usually

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.820
chosen to be representative of some type of

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.870
applications. So for example, we will not have

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.760
ten different compression programs in a benchmark. We will usually

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.390
have one or two because we think that those one

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.120
or two are probably accurately representing the behavior of the

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.970
other compression programs that we didn't put in the benchmark suite.
