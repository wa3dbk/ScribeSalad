00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So the key point is if you're generating keys,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
it's really important to use good randomness to generate keys in a way that

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
makes them unpredictable. And there was a study recently that looked at

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
public keys. We'll talk about asymmetric crypto in a future unit.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But the problem in generating those keys was not using good randomness.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And this was widely reported in the press--often in a somewhat misleading way--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
talking about the encryption system being broken, which it wasn't.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
All that was broken was--if you pick bad keys, the encryption doesn't work well.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So you should be careful not to use the built-in random generator

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in your programming language. It probably is not cryptographically secure.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
There are good random number generators provided by cryptography

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
libraries--like the Pi-Crypto library that we'll use for some of the code in this class

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that implements the Fortuna random number generator.
