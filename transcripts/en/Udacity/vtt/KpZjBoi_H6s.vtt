00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.780
There's one more refinement to
the algorithm that I can't resist, and

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.370
that's due to Dinic.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.020
He actually published his algorithm in
1970, two years before Edmonds-Karp.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.090
His key insight is that the work
of computing the shortest path

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.610
can be recycled so that a full
recomputation only needs to happen when

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.110
the shortest path distance changes,
not for every augmenting path.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.190
As with all augmenting path strategies,
we start with an initial flow of 0.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.300
Then we repeat the following.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.860
We build the level graph from
the residual flow network, and

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.420
let k be the shortest
path length from s to t.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.030
Then, while there's a path from source
to sink in the level graph that has

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.730
length k, we will augment
the flow along that path and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.640
then update the residual capacities.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.530
And we repeat this until there are no
more s-t paths in the residual network.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.050
And finally we just return the flow.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.100
Turning to the analysis,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.940
we will call one iteration
of this outer loop a phase.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.380
And we will be able to argue that
each phase increases the length

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.310
of the shortest s-t path in
the residual network by one.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.940
The principle here is the same as for
Edmonds-Karp.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.770
Augmenting by a shortest
path flow doesn't create

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.940
a shorter augmenting flow.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.100
Hence, once we've exhausted
all paths of a given length,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.450
the next shortest path
must be one edge longer.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.080
Within a phase, the level graph is
built by breadth-first search, so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.550
that only costs order E time.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.490
The hardest part of the argument will
be that this loop altogether takes only

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160
E times V time.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.650
We'll see this argument in a second.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.380
Altogether, we will show that Dinic's
algorithm takes E times V squared time,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.544
which is an improvement over the E
squared V time of Edmonds-Karp.
