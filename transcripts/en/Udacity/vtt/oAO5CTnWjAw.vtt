00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.660
There are a couple of different ways that we could do this problem. For one

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.235
thing, we could go back to the graph like we did the first time to figure out

00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:11.960
about where we thought this peak was, but since we already have an x value for

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.644
that peak of 0.959, we could also plug this value into the equation for V. We

00:00:16.644 --> 00:00:21.410
could use it as a value for the function. The general way we do it graphically

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.669
or by hand, we can see that the y value of this point is about equal to 15. So,

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.435
15.02 is the answer.
