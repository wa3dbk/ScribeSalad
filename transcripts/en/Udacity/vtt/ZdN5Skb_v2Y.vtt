00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.130
Now it's time for you to use that
installed software and build the images.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.100
We've provided all the files
in a Github repository.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.980
You should go ahead and
clone it to your local workstation.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.600
The files for this exercise are in
the packer templates directory.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.219
If you look in applicationsurfer.json,

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.930
you'll see that here we're
using shell provisioners.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.200
That's just for simplicity, so
you don't have to learn a new syntax.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.570
Even if you're not familiar with
shell scripts, don't worry.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.950
Take a look at some of them.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.510
Notice that they're just a file, and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.700
in that file you'll just see
one command after another.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.310
It's also possible in Packer to use
other provisioners, like Chef or

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.960
Puppet or Ansible or Salt.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.150
These can provide more
advanced functionality.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.940
You can see the provisioners listed
here in applicationserver.json.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.320
And each one points to one or
more files in the scripts directory.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.320
They'll run in the order
they are listed.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.460
An interesting note is
the provisioners are used for

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.280
all builders unless specified otherwise.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.950
As you can see, there's a couple
of scripts that are run only for

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.940
the virtual box iso builder.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.440
Okay enough talk.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.610
Go ahead and clone the repo changed
to the packer templates directory and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.200
follow the instructions in the readme or
in the instructionettes.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.720
When you run the packer build,
it will take a while,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.660
after all it first has to download
the OS image, then install nvm,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.830
then install all the software, then at
the end compress and save the image.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.970
Once you do that a look through
the application-server.json file and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.740
see if you can answer these questions.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.320
First, what directory does
the post-processor save the final

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.230
artifact in?

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.790
There's a variable for it.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.630
Enter that variable,
including the curly braces around it.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.630
And second, what's the file
extension for the final artifact?

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.130
Put that here.
