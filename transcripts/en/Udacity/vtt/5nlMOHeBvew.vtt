00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.079
So one classic study on display rules, we had students in Japan and in the U.S

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:11.070
being shown medical procedure films. And these were really disgusting films.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.986
Arms being amputated, burn graphs and so on. Now, as it turns out they saw the

00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:20.842
films in one of two different conditions though. Either alone or in the

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:25.096
presence of an authority figure. Now, in the US, it didn't matter whether the

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:28.360
students saw the film alone or in the presence of an authority figure, the

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.378
students showed real signs of disgust in either condition. But in Japan, it was

00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:39.480
only when they saw the film alone did the students show the disgust face.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.140
Because in Japan there's a rule, a cultural norm that prohibits disgust

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.617
expressions in the presence of an authority figure. So instead of that they

00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:53.111
mask that disgust with a smile. Interestingly these smiles were not genuine

00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:58.400
smiles because they didn't involve the eyes. So this is a good example of how

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.012
culture influences and dictates when it's okay to express which emotion. So

00:01:04.012 --> 00:01:08.420
what about gender and emotion? Of course, the stereotype is that women are more

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.550
emotional than men. question is, is there any evidence for this stereotype?

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.984
Well, yes and no. So as it turns out, men and women express emotion very

00:01:17.984 --> 00:01:24.889
similarly, although women do in fact smile a little bit more. But women do seem

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:29.021
to have an advantage in two areas. First, when talking about emotion, they're

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:33.912
more precise than that. Men seem to be a little bit more vague. And secondly,

00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:37.816
women are better at reading emotion on people's faces and hearing it in their

00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:39.250
voices.
