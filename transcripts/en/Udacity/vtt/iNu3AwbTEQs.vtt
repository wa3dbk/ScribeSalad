00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.802
So, I'm here with Sebastian, and Junior,

00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:03.651
one of Sebastian's self driving cars.

00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:06.802
Sebastian is going to give an idea of how rich inputs and outputs can be

00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:10.435
by talking about the kinds of inputs and outputs that he has on the self-driving car.

00:00:10.435 --> 00:00:14.952
[Sebastian] So, taking data in is essential to making self-driving cars work.

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:20.232
This machine has a lot of sensors that take data in at enormous rates.

00:00:20.232 --> 00:00:23.784
There is a laser range finder on the roof that rotates.

00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:28.998
And it takes scans 10 times a second of the entire surroundings or range scans.

00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:33.431
It has a security camera, very much like Google Street who's able to see in all directions.

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:36.113
In fact, this camera played an important role in Google Street's history

00:00:36.113 --> 00:00:40.748
and then it has stereo camera system, and also has a GPS system

00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:45.081
that we use to localize the car course [inaudible] based on satellite navigation.

00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:48.331
So, all this data, which are millions and millions of data points per second,

00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:51.713
get fed into the computer system that sits in the robot's trunk.

00:00:51.713 --> 00:00:57.398
So, this is the data. This is the laser data, but a million points per second.

00:00:57.398 --> 00:01:01.530
And you can see in his 3-dimensional depiction, the robot is parked in the garage,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.631
it sees the back wall, and it can see all kinds of other things around it.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:10.797
It uses that exact same data to avoid collisions with other cars, bicycles, pedestrians, and so on.

00:01:10.797 --> 00:01:16.298
And finally, the data gets funneled back to the car. These are the outputs of the computer system.

00:01:16.298 --> 00:01:18.981
And they go into the car: four little switches over here.

00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:22.915
They actuate the steering wheel; they use the brake, the gas.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:26.665
You can't really see it? It looks like a regular car; and it is.

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:30.665
But if I hit this one button over here, it turns into a self-driving car.
