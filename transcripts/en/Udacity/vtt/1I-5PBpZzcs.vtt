00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.865
If you drew out a diagram, it probably looked like this. But, the distance from

00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:07.455
zero was negative 4, and that can't be right. The absolute value of any

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:11.240
expression, or number, is always greater than or equal to zero. So, there's no

00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:15.265
value of m that can make this true, there's no solution. If you were solving the

00:00:15.277 --> 00:00:19.135
equations like before, you might have thought it was negative 2 and negative 6.

00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:24.596
But, let's check negative 2 to see the result. I can plug negative 2 in for m. 2

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:29.244
times negative 2 is negative 4, and negative 4 plus 8 is positive 4. We know the

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:33.573
absolute value of this 4 is positive 4. It's the distance from zero. And it

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:38.158
can't be negative 4. It's not true. And that's why none of these solutions work.
