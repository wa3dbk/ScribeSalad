00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.790
Whenever we want to factor a quadratic trinomial, we want to find two factors of

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.330
a and c that add up to b. This allows us to rewrite our x term, like in 7x in

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.300
the last problem, and then to continue using factoring by grouping. But our real

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.960
first step is to see if there's a greatest common factor first. We should factor

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.293
that out and then continue this process if we can.
