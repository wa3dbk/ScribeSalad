00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.469
Now the NAT clearly violates the end-to-end principle,

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.280
because machines behind the NAT are not globally

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.020
addressable, or routable, and other hosts on the

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.680
public Internet cannot initiate inbound connections to these devices

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.311
behind the NAT. Now there are ways to

00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:17.901
get around this, they're various protocols. One is called

00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:21.593
STUN, or signalling and tunneling through UDP-enabled NAT

00:00:21.593 --> 00:00:25.534
devices. And in these types of protocols, the device

00:00:25.534 --> 00:00:29.670
sends an initial outbound packet somewhere, simply to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.222
create an entry in the NAT table and

00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:35.430
once that entry is created. We now have

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.920
a globally routable address and port to which devices

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.330
on a public Internet can send traffic. Now

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.120
these devices somehow have to learn that public IP

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.310
address and port that corresponds to that service

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.660
and this might be done using DNS for example.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.865
It's also possible to statically configure, these tunnels

00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:56.800
or mappings on your NAT device at home.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.270
Needless to say, even with these types of

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.550
hacks and workarounds for NAT, it's clear that network

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.210
address translation is a violation of the end-to-end

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.020
principle. Because by default two hosts on the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.710
Internet, one on the home network and one

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.430
on the public Internet, cannot communicate directly by default.
