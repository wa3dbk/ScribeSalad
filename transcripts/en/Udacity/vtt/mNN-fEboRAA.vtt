00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.550
Well, what exactly is
mandatory access control?

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.659
Why do we need it?

00:00:04.659 --> 00:00:08.624
I think we already talked about that,
although the users,

00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:11.957
it's people who actually
create information and

00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:15.690
run applications that
manipulate such information.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.383
But people work for a company or
a garment agency, we'll talk about that.

00:00:21.383 --> 00:00:23.518
And it's really their employer and

00:00:23.518 --> 00:00:27.574
somebody that's trusted by them
already acting on behalf of them,

00:00:27.574 --> 00:00:32.180
should really be able to specify how
certain kind of data can be shared.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.670
First of all, in taking the power of

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.590
deciding how the data should be shared
from the user, and, essentially,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.520
you can think about the user being
told the right way to share this data

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.850
is based on this policy
that the company has.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.668
And this policy could be, it may depend
on the kind of company that we have.

00:00:55.668 --> 00:00:59.981
So, for example, hospitals with
electronic medical records and

00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:03.320
stuff like that clearly
have patient records.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.929
And we know that patient health
information, their health conditions,

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:11.052
information about them
is highly sensitive, and

00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:15.683
who can see it has to be limited, and
how it can be shared has to be limited.

00:01:15.683 --> 00:01:19.220
And it's not really up to just
the hospitals, they would want to do it.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.104
But there are regulations
that force them to do this or

00:01:23.104 --> 00:01:27.437
force them to control how
patient records can be accessed.

00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:30.800
So in the context of so
are held information.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.112
We have HIPAA, which is the regulation
the government imposes on anyone,

00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:38.051
entities like hospitals,

00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:43.635
that collect information that goes
into patient records, medical records.

00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:46.740
And of course, there's a need
to share that information.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.367
If you go see a different doctor,

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:50.939
they need to have access
your medical information.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.621
But how access to it should be created?

00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:59.090
It's not the particular person who does
data entry for a patient's record.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.310
They don't get to decide
who else can see.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.250
This has to be decided
by the hospital that's

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.520
informed by this regulatory
policy called HIPAA.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.093
This is protecting people's
health information,

00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:12.734
privacy, and things like that.

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:15.060
We said in mandatory access control,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.422
it's not just the user owning a resource
and being able to control, but

00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:22.639
it's really the user's
organizational company.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.860
Hopefully, this example information,
being medical records,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.100
convinces you that sharing
of information has to be

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.810
mandated by someone other than
the user who's creating it
