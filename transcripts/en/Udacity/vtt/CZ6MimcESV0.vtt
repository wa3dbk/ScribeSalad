00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's start this solution video off by looking through all of the incorrect

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
implementations of the queue, and then we'll see how we actually caught all of the bugs.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The first queue has an error where you enqueue and it only stores integers

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
up to 2^16 and that's roughly 32,000.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
When you enqueue things it's just silently wraps it back around to zero if you go over that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The second queue silently fails to create queues with more than 15 elements.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So in the initializer, if the max size is greater than 15, then it just sets it to 15

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and doesn't tell you about it at all.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The third queue is a little tricky--it implements the empty method by trying to dequeue an element

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and checking if the dequeue is none.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If it is, then it returns true. If it isn't, then it returns false.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And because the empty method changes the state of the queue when it shouldn't,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
this is going to cause buggy behavior.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The fourth queue has a bug in the dequeue method.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
When you try to dequeue from an empty queue it returns false

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
where it should, according to the specification, return' none.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The final queue just holds one less element than you tell it to hold.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So it's just decrement size max when you pass it in by one and then stores that many elements

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
instead of how many you told it to.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now let's try to catch all of these bugs.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The first queue can be caught by just trying to enqueue a value greater than 2^16

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and then dequeuing it and check that the value is correct.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The second queue, you try to enqueue more than 15 elements--

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
remember that was the one that only stored 15 without telling you.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
As soon as you go past 15, this assertion should fail. The third queue is a little bit trickier.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We create a queue with two elements and we try to enqueue 10 which should succeed fine,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and we check that, then we assert that the queue is not empty which it shouldn't be,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
but remember that this empty function checks that it's empty by trying to dequeue,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
which removes 10 from the queue.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Now when we try to dequeue a second time, now the queue is empty.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It's not going to return 10, it's going to return none. This assertion is going to fail.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The fourth queue returns false instead of none when you try to dequeue from an empty queue.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
To test this, we instantiate a 2-element queue, and we try to immediately dequeue

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
from that empty queue, and we should get none, which is what we're checking.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
but instead we get false, so this assertion will fail.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Now the final queue just holds one last item than intended, so we created 2-element queue,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and we try to enqueue two elements, and this will fail for the second since this queue will only hold

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
one element not two, so this second attempt will fail.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Okay, I hope you enjoyed catching all those bugs.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
This is something that comes up fairly frequently when you have to do blackbox testing

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
when you don't actually know the code that you're running against, you don't have access to it.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We'll talk a bit more about that in Unit 2 and I hope to see you there. Thanks!
