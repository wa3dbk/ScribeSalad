00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.150
The next piece we'll add to our app
is a Leanback details fragment.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.550
When the user selects one of our movies,
we'd like to bring it front and center.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.400
And we'll use the details
fragment to do just this.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.600
The details fragment has three sections.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.309
The first is an overview row,
which contains text fields like a title,

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.250
an author, and a description.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.010
Below that is an actions row.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.460
In our sample app, we've used the said
actions to watch a trailer, and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.160
to buy and rent movies.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.810
These actions of course,
are fully customizable.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.250
Finally, if you scroll down you
can see a list of related movies.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.420
Pretty cool, right?

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.400
The details fragment works in a similar
way as the browse fragment in

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.660
the previous lesson, it provides
the smooth animations and most of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.250
the functionality behind the scenes, all
we have to do is add our content to it.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.770
The pattern is the same as
in our previous lesson.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.250
First, we create
a details activity class.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.800
And it's only job will be to apply

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.550
a layout that contains
the details fragment.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.540
As before, this layout does little else
except specify our details fragment.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.100
But before we see how that works,
let's look at how we can start it up.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.990
Here I am back in the browse fragment.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.319
When the user selects a movie,
we'd like to show our details fragment.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.980
And to do so, we're going to
add an ItemViewClickListener

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.680
to the browse fragment.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.720
In the on activity created method,
uncomment set up event listeners.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.680
And let's see how that method works.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.210
Let's look inside
the ItemViewClickListener.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.080
We have two different types
of cards in our display,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.830
and this listener contains
logic to handle each.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.260
The important part is that if a movie's
clicked, we fire an intent to start up

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.230
our details activity class, and we
include the selected movie as an extra,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.590
so we can retrieve it later
from our details fragment.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.670
The second listener on the browse
fragment is used to detect when a user

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.190
selects a movie.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.100
These names can be
a little bit confusing, so

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.530
by select, I actually mean
that certain card has focus.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.820
A neat trick is that inside this
listener we can update the background

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.460
image of the browse fragment
to reflect the selected movie.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.850
To do so,
return to on activity created and

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.070
uncomment prepared background manager,
and setupEventListeners.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.410
Let's run the project now and
see what we get.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.030
Here, you can see the background's
changing to reflect the currently

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.460
selected card.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.900
Pretty cool, right?

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.480
I won't go into the logic of how
the BackgroundManager, works but

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.530
there is one note.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.139
Notice that if I scroll very quickly,

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.258
the background doesn't
immediately change.

00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:13.290
Instead we wait for about a second
after a card has been selected

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.990
before adjusting the background.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.860
This provides a much
smoother user experience.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.500
Now let's see how to set
up the details fragment.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.370
The pattern to set up
this class is pretty much

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.040
the same as the browse fragment.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.280
I'll focus just on the new concepts, and
you can find more details in the notes.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.910
We'll start by populating
the DetailsOverviewRow,

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.020
which is a class provided by Leanback.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.550
And this is going to contain the title,
the author, and the description.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.442
First, we'll pass it a reference
to the selected movie.

00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:43.320
The DetailsOverviewRow will store this
as an object that we can access later.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.945
Next we add actions.

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:47.665
The actions class is also
provided by Leanback.

00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:49.755
To respond when one of our
action buttons is clicked,

00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:51.955
we'll setup all callback later on.

00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:55.575
First, it's important to understand
the DetailsOverviewRow will be presented

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.850
by DetailsOverviewRowPresenter.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.840
Aren't Java naming
conventions just great?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.260
They're so concise.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.493
This presenter already knows
how to layout our actions row,

00:03:03.493 --> 00:03:05.470
because that's built in to Leanback.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.735
But we need to add our callbacks to it.

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:10.870
Here's where we do that, and
take a look at how these are handled.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.840
The most important action starts
at the video playing activity

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.790
via the play back overlay fragment.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.350
This is also provided by pingback,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.840
and we'll see how it works later in our
lesson on the Universal Media Player.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.590
Last, although our presenter
knows how to present actions,

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.760
we have to tell it how
to display our movie.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.760
To do so,
we create a DetailsDescriptionPresenter.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.170
This is a very simple class, which binds
our movie data to the details fragment.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.630
One last new concept.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.600
Our details fragment uses two
different presenters, one for

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.140
the overview row, and another for
the related videos row.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.560
And by the way, if you look through the
code, the related videos row is built

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.870
identically to how a row of videos
was created in the browse fragment,

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.270
by using list rows and
a ListRowPresenter.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.740
We'll need a way to collect these two
presenters into a single object adapter

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.970
before passing them to
the browse fragment.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.090
And to do so,
we'll use a ClassPresenterSelector.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.400
This is a simple class that associates
presenters with the classes they should

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.910
be used to present, like this.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.710
Once we created an ObjectAdapter
with our class presenter,

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.830
we can add different types of objects to
it as long as it knows how to present

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.280
these classes.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.310
And finally, we can set this
ObjectAdapter as the main adapter for

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.820
the details fragment.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.990
Let's run the project now and
see what we get.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.490
Watch what happens if you
select an action now.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.250
Here the playback fragment appears.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.450
Pretty cool, right?

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.220
Now, I know there was a lot of
code here and few new concepts.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.730
But if you think about how much
functionality you got in return,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.210
I hope you'll agree that
it's a good trade-off.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.590
And one last tip,

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.860
here we use the Leanback support
library to build a catalog browser.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.970
But you could easily use it for

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.270
something else other
than displaying movies.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.130
For example, you might have cards
that just play weather information,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.110
as in the Sunshine app.
