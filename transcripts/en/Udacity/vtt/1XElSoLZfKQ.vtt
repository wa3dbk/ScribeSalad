Congratulations, you've now got a working search engine.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You can crawl the Web, finding content from pages, building an index,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and then respond to search queries with the pages that contain that content.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is really exciting. I think I'm ready to start my search company.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Cool. And so I was looking at the competitors out there, and the key is that you've got to have a catchy name.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So Google, Duck Duck Go. I've got to come up with something.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is the really hard part. Yeah. I'm ready to announce -- I'm ready to share with you my idea.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I've been putting a lot of thought into this. How about Search With Peter dot Info?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Oooh. Yeah. So there's a lot of work to do. I've got to buy servers.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I've got to get employees. Investors. I've got to -- Oh, man -- I should probably start now.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Okay. Well, good luck to Peter. There are some more things that we want to learn in this class.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And there's some things we need to do to really improve the search engine to make it useful.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In Unit 5 we'll work on making the search engine faster.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And in Unit 6 we'll work on making it find the best page for a given query, not just all the pages.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So for the rest of this unit we're going to look at understanding more how the Internet works

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and what happens when we request a page on the World Wide Web.
