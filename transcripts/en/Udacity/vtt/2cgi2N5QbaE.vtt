00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.100
The second of Kruchten's views is the developmental view, and

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.870
here we're concerned with the source code.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.010
The logical view had to do with the system,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.010
primarily with how it's going to execute.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.340
The development view has to do with the source code.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.980
And the units of source code which might be considered for

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.840
modeling in the development view include packages, classes, subsystems,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.390
libraries, files, and so on.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.670
UML package diagrams, UML component diagrams can convey this sort of thing,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.416
as can the mechanisms provided by source control systems such as CVS or,

00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:43.222
or, or, or some of it's SVN or, or Github or some of the more

00:00:43.222 --> 00:00:49.910
modern modern systems allow the developers to break the system into modules.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.650
Here is a reminder of some of the slides that we saw when we were

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.600
reviewing UML diagram types.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.230
Here's a class diagram with packages, here's a package diagram, and

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.480
here's a component diagram where the rectangles correspond with the components.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.740
The the arrows correspond to specific

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.120
dependencies among the components indicating that a component

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.040
supplies what is needed by a component at the other end of the line.
