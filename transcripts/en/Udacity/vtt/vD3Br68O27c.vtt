00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:05.799
So let's investigate this a bit further. And for now, we'll be focusing on vertex cover and on independent set.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.899
So let's say we're given a graph with N vertices, and we're looking at the smallest possible vertex cover,

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.932
so a minimum vertex cover for that graph. And for the largest possible independent set.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:22.999
So a maximum independent set. So let's say the size of the minimum vertex cover for this graph here is K,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.299
so some integer smaller than N. And then--and you know this from the reduction between vertex cover and independent set--

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.866
the largest possible independent set that we can find in this graph has size N minus K.

00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:43.432
So now, instead of finding the smallest possible vertex cover, let's run the factor two approximation algorithm.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:52.299
And that algorithm will give us some number, and that number is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 2k.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.932
And what that means for the independent set, of course, is if we take those N vertices here

00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:04.399
and take away those 2k vertices, then of course we still arrive at an independent set, and that independent set has a size of

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.199
at least N minus 2k. Because the size of the vertex cover and of the independent set always add up to N.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.899
So this here would be the optimum solution, and this here would be what the vertex cover factor two approximation finds.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.732
So what about the approximation factor? So you already know that for vertex cover we have a factor two approximation.

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:29.999
And the way you arrive at the two is, of course, since this is a minimization problem, you take what the approximation finds

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.732
and divide it by the size of the optimum solution. So it's basically 2k over k, and that's equal to two.

00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:42.366
Now, what about independent set? So, independent set is a maximization problem.

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:49.366
So, for vertex cover, we took what the algorithm finds and divided it by the size of the optimum solution.

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:55.832
But that was because it was a minimization problem. For a maximization problem, given how we define approximation factors,

00:01:55.833 --> 00:02:02.932
we'll have to do it just the other way around. So the approximation factor here is the size of the optimum solution

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:13.066
divided by what the approximation actually finds. So it's divided by N minus 2k, which is equal to one plus K over N minus 2k.

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:23.132
So the factor two approximation algorithm for vertex cover is actually a factor one plus K over N minus 2k

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:25.800
approximation algorithm for independent set.
