Let's first play around with this really cool applet. Click the link below to

00:00:04.507 --> 00:00:09.398
open it, you need to have Java installed on your computer to view it. Now, what

00:00:09.398 --> 00:00:15.110
happens if you roll one die at least 100 times. To get a feel for it, you can

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.806
try rolling one die, one time. Try rolling it again, and then, you'll see the

00:00:20.806 --> 00:00:26.332
distribution start to build up. Then, you can change this part here, so that

00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:31.900
you're rolling one die, 100 times and it'll plot all of the values that the die

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.651
lands on, or the simulated die. So, what happens you roll it at least 100 times?

00:00:37.652 --> 00:00:40.143
What does the distribution look like?
