00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.250
We know that the natural numbers start
with one and increase by ones from there.

00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:11.425
So there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.
Continuing to count up forever, and we

00:00:11.437 --> 00:00:16.675
know that the whole numbers are all of
these numbers plus zero. So if we were to

00:00:16.687 --> 00:00:22.060
list all of the whole numbers in ascending
numbers they would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:27.755
etcetera. So that means that every natural
number is a whole number, which is the

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:33.935
second choice here and the last choice is
also true because almost all of the whole

00:00:33.947 --> 00:00:38.205
numbers are natural numbers but zero is
not a natural number.
