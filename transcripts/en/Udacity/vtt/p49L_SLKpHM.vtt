00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.710
I think actually, so the problem
statement of choosing the most valuable

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.600
one, I think is too hard a standard.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.090
So you just want to start a fire, so
if it will burst into flames, it's good.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.960
Now did you hit the perfect place?

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.210
If I had started the fire over here,
would it have burned faster and bigger?

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.470
Maybe, but I started the fire.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.690
And so that means, how do I recognize
a segment that's not very inflammable.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.680
So, what does wet wood
look like versus dry wood?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.220
And I think a couple of things,
with the target customer,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.010
the key issues are going to be,
is this a target customer I understand?

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.390
Do I have access to them, can I
communicate with them clearly, and do

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.270
they have the kind of funding or money
necessary to participate with my offer?

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.330
Okay, so if you say okay,
I got that, okay.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.740
Then we go to the compelling
reason to buy, and

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.690
the key issue there is how compelling
is my compelling reason to buy?

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.820
Entrepreneurs have a compelling reason
to sell, so we think our products should

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.990
be bought, and we think the compelling
reason to buy is I need your money.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.040
But that's not how a customers thinks,
right?

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.500
The customer is thinking, now I'm
going to participate in your offer

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.540
because of something I need,
not something you need and so and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.920
then the issue is it, before if
you're just doing it for free, and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.220
a lot of this stuff innitially stars for
free, then you can kind

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.830
of be a lot looser because I'm
giving you a few clicks of my life.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.560
Most people are willing to donate
a few clicks of their life.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.620
The third one's then going to be,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.910
does my offer generally scratch
the itch that I said it would.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.750
And so they call it product market fit.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.880
Does my product really, really do this?

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.502
I mean I know I want to say it does,
I want them to buy it,

00:01:40.502 --> 00:01:42.057
I've said all the right words.

00:01:42.057 --> 00:01:45.390
But is that really me,
is that really who we are?

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.670
And there you have to be
brutally honest with yourself.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.050
A lot of times you hope it will, and

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.850
the market's giving you
a message saying, no, no.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.750
And you're going, yes, yes, no.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.491
Being an entrepreneur is
a very funny state because,

00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:04.610
you need to have enough confidence to
hear a bunch of no's and keep going.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.130
But you can't be tone deaf, right?

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.050
You have to learn and not just be
stubborn, and that's a bit of a touch.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.170
And then the final one is,

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.160
is my offer in this context
truly differentiated enough.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.100
Because when you're starting out,
nobody knows who you are.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.810
So it's not like they're loyal to you.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.220
So you really do have to stand out at
the beginning, or else the world would

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.280
go, well why wouldn't I just
go with one of the other guys?
