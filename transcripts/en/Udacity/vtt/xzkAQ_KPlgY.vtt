00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.270
So look at the macro operators at a high level abstraction, consider this one

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.630
part of the current problem. Here is the initial state, here is the goal state,

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.440
there is the final plan. To enlist this idea of macro operators, and

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.608
hierarchical planning, at multiple [UNKNOWN] of abstraction, let us read with

00:00:15.608 --> 00:00:19.810
this problem that we had encountered earlier. This was the initial state,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.600
this was the goal state. And we come up, we came up with this as the final plan.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.590
Now, we can think of these three operations as being abstracted out

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.980
into a macro operator that we can call unstack. And these three operations

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.630
being abstracted out into a macro operator that we can call stack-ascending.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.340
Just simply saying stacking them in a particular ascending order. Here is

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.670
the specification of the two macro operators. Unstack, and stack-ascending.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.260
You do preconditions and post conditions. And this macro operator,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.150
also tells you how this macro operator can be expanded in to the lower level

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.700
move operations. Similarly for the stack ascending macro operator.
