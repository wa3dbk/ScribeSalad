00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
Welcome to problem set five. Let's talk a bit about approximating vertex cover.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.660
Suppose someone comes up to you and tells you that they devised

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.490
a really really clever algorithm for approximating vertex cover.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.030
Let's call it clever&lt;u&gt;vc.&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.600
Now, this is so clever that they don't actually want to show you the source code.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.650
They want to keep it secret so you can't see that,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.440
and they don't even return the list of vertices that are in the cover.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.520
They just tell you the size of the cover.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.290
So, how would you go about figuring out the performance of this and how it works?

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.290
In order to test the performance of clever&lt;u&gt;vc,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.570
how about we test it against four fairly large graphs

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.540
of 10,000; 20,000; 30,000; and 40,000 vertices,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.060
and let's compare that against factor-2 approximation algorithm that we have.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.440
See what the sizes that both come up with are.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.920
So, you can see that the sizes of minimum vertex cover for clever&lt;u&gt;vc&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.190
is always smaller than factor-2 approximation, sometimes, not very much.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.069
For example in this run, 233 versus 234, not much of a difference.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:11.580
In other cases, it's a rather large difference like 295 versus 600 in the 30,000 verticy graph.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.450
Now, based on this table, there are number of things that we can say about clever-vc.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.770
And these are the questions that I would like you to answer for me,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.790
the statements that we can definitely say about clever&lt;u&gt;vc,&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.820
and if you need to refer back to the table,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.520
then we'll have that below in the instruction comments.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.610
Can we say that given any graph, clever&lt;u&gt;vc will outperform the 2-approximation algorithm&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.570
since in the graph that we gave it, it most certainly did outperform the 2-approximation algorithm?

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.530
Now, can we also say that clever&lt;u&gt;vc is a factor-1.75 approximation algorithm&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.650
or finally could we actually say that clever-vc is not a correct algorithm?

00:01:51.650 --> 99:59:59.000
And check true or false for all three of these.
