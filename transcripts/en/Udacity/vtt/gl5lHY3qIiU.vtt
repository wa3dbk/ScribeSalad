00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And again the answer is simple 95 means you're going to look into this column over here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
2.145 happens to be the value over here, which translates to 14.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now, we do know that the number of data points is the number degrees of freedom plus 1.

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So 15 is the correct answer, not 14.
