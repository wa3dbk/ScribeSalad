00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.207
You're comparing three brands of clothing. Let's call them Snapzi, Irisa, and

00:00:05.207 --> 00:00:12.056
LolaMoon. A random selection from each of these have the following prices. Are

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:16.968
any of these brands more or less expensive than the others. Use your intuition

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:21.126
to guess if there are significant differences in price between any two of these

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:26.180
brands. Or, is there not a significant difference between any of the brands?
