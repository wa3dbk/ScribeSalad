00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.487
The method to find the number of occurrences of any word is going to be pretty

00:00:02.487 --> 00:00:06.800
similar to the one for occurrences of Alice. But instead of using specific

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.830
references to the word Alice, like Alice, and the length of Alice. It'll use

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.260
the given word, and the length of the given word. The calculation of the length

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.500
won't change. But the calculation of the length without the word will. Looks

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.754
like I need to actually take in a parameter. And now I return the length, minus

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:34.498
the length without the word. Over the length of the word. Let's add something

00:00:34.498 --> 00:00:39.458
to our booktester, to test our new method. To check it we could compare it to

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:43.244
our answer for Alice. Looks like I didn't actually make a method occurrences

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:51.760
of. Ops. Occurrences of Alice. Should be more general. Hopefully now it'll

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.177
compile better. Here we know to expect 395 from before, and there's another

00:00:57.177 --> 00:01:03.662
word that we checked how many times it occurs. We saw before that Mad Hatter

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:09.523
doesn't occur at all. Let's try this out. Looks like we got the answers we

00:01:09.523 --> 00:01:10.940
expected.
