00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.130
All right.

00:00:00.132 --> 00:00:04.353
If you said positive 2 for this exponent great work. When I multiply by a

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:09.024
positive power of 10, I move the decimal two places right. For this next one I

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:13.586
notice that my decimal point is here. I need to make it go to the left side of

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:18.073
6. I know that my exponent needs to be negative since I'm moving my decimal

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:22.895
left. If I go one spot The decimal would be here, but I need two more zeros. So,

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:27.466
I'm going to go one, two, and the decimal will end up here. Remember, I add

00:00:27.478 --> 00:00:32.188
zeroes as place holders whenever I move the decimal. I move the decimal three

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.828
places to the left, so my exponent is negative 3. Okay, so, for this one, my

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.142
decimal starts here. I don't have anything after the decimal. And I notice that

00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:46.313
I need to move it to the left. So I'm going to go one, two, three, four. My

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:52.370
decimal moved four spots to the left. So I have to have an exponent of negative

00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:57.974
4. And this case I want my decimal point to end up to the right of 6 and one

00:00:57.986 --> 00:01:03.111
more place, here. So I'm going to move it, one, two, And then I have to add 1

00:01:03.123 --> 00:01:08.039
more spot, where a zero would be as a place holder. So I moved it one, two,

00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:13.220
three, four spots. So positive 4 would be this exponent. Remember, positive

00:01:13.232 --> 00:01:18.711
exponents move our decimal place to the right. Negative exponents move the

00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:20.558
decimal place to the left.
