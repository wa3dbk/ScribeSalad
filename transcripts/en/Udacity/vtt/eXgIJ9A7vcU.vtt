00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.390
Before we start, this is important. Save your code away for this exercise.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.778
You'll use it as the basis for the next exercise. We don't start the next

00:00:07.778 --> 00:00:11.358
exercise with the solution for this one. At this point, you should be using a

00:00:11.358 --> 00:00:15.910
text editor for these exercises. I like Notepad ++. Others like SublimeText, and

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.320
there's plenty of others out there. By saving code snippets around, you can look

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.930
these over in future exercises and see what you did. In this exercise you'll

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.529
make a flower, you'll start with this a stem and stamen of a flower with the

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.380
single petal part, a comb sort of stuck in the stem. I start you off with this

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.327
cone which is a child of the petal which is a child of the flower as a whole.

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:37.938
Your job is to make 24 instances of this petal and form a flower. You'll need to

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:41.920
use rotational [unknown] angles applied in the proper order. And translations.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.312
And you'll need to apply these to the cone object and to the petal object which

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:48.514
is its parent. Note that all the tips of the cones meet in the middle of the

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:49.424
sphere, the stamen.
