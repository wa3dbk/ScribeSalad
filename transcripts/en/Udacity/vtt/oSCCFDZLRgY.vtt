My name is Dave Bennent.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm a member of the team that restored this machine--the world's first hard disk drive.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It was announced in 1956 it was the first product of IBM's laboratory in San Jose, California.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is a big machine with a very small capacity.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
However, in 1956 it was very important.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This machine had 50 disks 24 inches in diameter.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It stores a total of 5 million 6-bit characters, 3.75 megabytes in today's world.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Any disk drive that doesn't have at least gigabytes in it is obsolete by modern standards.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It was actually designed to run a request from the Air Force

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
for storage capacity for their 50,000 spare parts inventory.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It was designed to hold 50,000 character records

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
with access to any records in less than a second.
