00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.253
The real kind of relationship that
you have with the co-founder,

00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:06.000
is very similar to the relationship
that you have with your partner.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.110
Your for them.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.300
You can say everything to them.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.500
You can be happy, and cry,
and be upset and furious.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.890
And share what you really are, and
what you really feel with them.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.900
And they will accept it,
and they will support you.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.850
It sounds very sentimental and
very weird, but that I believe,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.220
that's the secret of a great
partnership between partners.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.230
Being there for each other.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.208
Understanding what's your partner's
strengths and weaknesses,

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:49.780
and really becoming a stronger unit,
a stronger combination.
