00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:04.700
Okay, now in order to go further, let us start thinking in terms of,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:12.010
how we can put all of these precepts and goal, into some feature value language,

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.520
so that we can store it inside Sole. It is one attempt at capturing all of

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.070
this knowledge, so I can say that it's the 7th inning. Inning is 7th.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.600
It's the top of the 7th inning. It's the top here. Runners are on 2nd and

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.030
3rd base. 2nd and 3rd base. And then so on and

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.119
so forth. Note that at the bottom I have goal is to escape the inning.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.300
Which I think means in this particular context, to go to the next inning,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.320
without letting the batter score anymore points. So now that we have. Put all of

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.150
this precepts coming from the world and the goal, into some kind of simple

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.270
representation which has features and values in it, the fun is going to begin.
