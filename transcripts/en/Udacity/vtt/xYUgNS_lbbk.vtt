00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.985
However, there could be some potential negative effects with people using

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:07.290
psilocybin. Could you touch on perhaps some unusual experiences?

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.506
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, so it's very important to understand that there are risks, very real

00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:17.258
risks, associated with exposure to psilocybin. So in our studies at Johns

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:22.250
Hopkins in, in a therapeutic context and when we are doing studies in healthy

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.830
volunteers. We very carefully screen our volunteers. We develop rapport with

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.760
them. The drug is given under very tightly-supervised and supportive context,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.584
and we do after-care with them. why do we this? So, the reason that we do this

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:48.948
is because unfortunately psilocybin can produce some, some very difficult long

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:56.362
lasting, and potentially harmful effects. So, number one is that, under the

00:00:56.362 --> 00:01:01.606
influence of psilocybin, people can have panic or fear reactions, and they can

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:09.298
end up engaging in dangerous behavior, and it's uncommon. But it's not unheard

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:14.034
of to read reports where people run out into traffic, jump out of windows, you

00:01:14.034 --> 00:01:22.745
know, flee in ways that get themselves or other people into trouble. Two is

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:27.033
that there's, there really is concern, and this is more serious than just the

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:33.472
panic, there really is concern that in some individual. Exposure to psilocybin

00:01:33.472 --> 00:01:35.266
and other compounds of this

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.124
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:36.124 --> 00:01:44.510
hallucinating class can precipitate in during psychiatric illness. the, the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.794
worst possible case would be precipitation of psychosis or schizophrenia of

00:01:48.794 --> 00:01:55.580
someone who was already vulnerable to that disorder. And that, it, that's a, a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:03.674
lifelong, irreversible disorder that is is disastrous for someone. Other than

00:02:03.674 --> 00:02:09.298
that there are some people who report persisting PTSD-like syndrome depression

00:02:09.298 --> 00:02:15.703
and anxiety disorders. So, we're very concerned about that and, and it's one of

00:02:15.703 --> 00:02:20.554
the reasons we screen people very carefully and support them through these

00:02:20.554 --> 00:02:27.393
kinds of experiences. We just recently have conducted, and are continuing to

00:02:27.393 --> 00:02:31.413
collect data on an online survey asking people about the most difficult

00:02:31.413 --> 00:02:37.758
experiences they've had with psilocybin. And what we're finding is that most

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:42.113
people are reporting experiences when it's isolated to their most difficult

00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:46.535
experience, they're reporting experiences that are among the most difficult

00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:53.408
that they've ever had in their lives. And very often, the single most

00:02:53.408 --> 00:02:58.342
challenging experience, so there's nothing easy about these experiences. But

00:02:58.342 --> 00:03:05.398
the the more sobering statistics out of this survey is that anywhere from about

00:03:05.398 --> 00:03:11.964
3% to 10% of people are reporting persisting effects that look like some kind

00:03:11.964 --> 00:03:22.038
of persisting psychological harmful consequence. So some of these people never

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:27.606
had been in therapy before and have sought out psychological counseling for

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:33.174
fearful reaction, or anxiety disorders, or paranoid after the session with

00:03:33.174 --> 00:03:40.120
Silly Simon. And they attribute their seeking that out to the Silly Simon

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.276
session. about 6% of people report a decreased sense of well-being and, and so

00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:52.996
while these compounds may have great therapeutic potentials, there are also

00:03:52.996 --> 00:03:57.062
significant risks.

00:03:57.062 --> 00:03:58.196
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, right.
