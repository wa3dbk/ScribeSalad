00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
We start off with an input for vertex cover then apply pre-processing

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.300
using the rule that we just discovered, which means we then already know that this vertex here

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.560
must be put into the vertex cover as well as this one here and this one here

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.610
and these all do not have to be in the vertex cover and this of course is

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.920
dramatically effective in this case here.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.670
It's unfortunately not always the case in practice but as you can see it only leaves a very small part

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.340
of the network actually where we have to find an assignment but the main point is that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.150
we now put this into a search tree to find the best possible vertex cover for those vertices

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.360
where we have not yet found an assignment.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.480
And now my point is this, the search tree that we had so far was as follows.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.150
We started out by looking at an uncovered edge and then we branch into three possibilities.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.300
We either put exactly one of the vertices into the vertex cover or both.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.130
And now comes the cool part, if we have applied pre-processing then we can redesign

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:06.170
our search tree because what this pre-processing step means basically is that we have eliminated

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.490
or we have already assigned all vertices now to have just a single neighbor.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.560
Now that we have applied pre-processing, we know a little bit more about these vertices here

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.770
because we know that this vertex here will have at least one more neighbor

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.120
because otherwise we would have already found it in the pre-processing

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.560
and this one here will also have another neighbor.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.910
There can be more. The same thing here.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.340
What we can now do is we can do a more sophisticated search tree

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.220
and that sophisticated search tree is going to be based on this part here, these three vertices.

00:01:40.220 --> 99:59:59.000
You can do more sophisticated search trees but I just want to show you the basic principle here.
