00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.150
To construct this diagram,

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.010
you should take the following steps using a UML class model diagram as notation.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.800
First of all, indicate external actors but only one activity.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.640
That is, there's only going to be one class in here and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.490
that's the class of the text browser itself.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.470
Indicate in the external stimuli or events that can affect the text browser.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.220
And indicate how the text browser communicates it's results back to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.000
the external actors, it's percepts.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.240
So you want to take a crack at producing such a, a,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.990
a diagram that lays out the text browsers relationship to the external actors.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.760
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I have I think kind of what are the things that you can

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.750
do to the system.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.629
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's, let's start with [COUGH] what are the actors,

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.300
the external actors?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.750
&gt;&gt; So for the external actors, I've shown drawn the user using the text browser,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.140
but also I believe we mentioned previously that the operating system is

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.420
also an actor, even though you may not think of it visually, like,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.730
see that happening.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.310
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.390
So there's two external actors in here.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.990
The end user and

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.040
the operating system which is going to supply the actual file contents.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.200
There's the the classic self which represents the system, okay.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.390
And you also have some events okay.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.820
What events do you have?

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.070
&gt;&gt; So, an event that the user would, start with the user,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.860
what the user can do with a text browser, view the text browser,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.950
can move the handle that's in the tray, and then also resize the text browser.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.260
&gt;&gt; So which one of, which ones of those are events?

00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:39.720
&gt;&gt; events?

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.696
The movement of the handle's an event,

00:01:42.696 --> 00:01:46.030
the resizing of the window's also an event.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.560
Viewing's kind of like a continuous process,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.750
there's no kind of instantaneous event that's happening.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.610
&gt;&gt; Well but the system is not doing the viewser, viewing,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.140
the use is doing the viewing, so.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.730
&gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; That's actually a percept of the system right.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.950
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; It's something that the system provides for the user.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.620
In addition to the actual lines of file,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.540
what else is the system communicating back to the user?

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.550
&gt;&gt; We're also communicating back the size of the handle.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.430
Something that we're seeing.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.770
&gt;&gt; That, that says something about the proportion of the file that's visible.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.940
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.110
And we're also communicating back to the user the height of the view port.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.230
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.300
Obviously the the user has control over that height.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.120
And the system is

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.430
going to give feedback by showing a view port with different heights on it.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.850
And you mentioned also that the contents, and that's clearly a percept as well.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.020
So we have the height of the viewport, it's contents, the size of the handle,

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.810
and the position of the handle on the tray is another percept.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.130
&gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Okay, and we have the two events, the resizing event and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.390
the scrolling event.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.920
We have the two external actors and we have the class itself.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.270
Okay, so we can take the informal sketch that you've done, and

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.930
we can lay it out using some kind of UML tool into a precise UML diagram that's

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.280
got the single rectangle indicating the, the class labeled text browser.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.120
It's got some attributes which include the height,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.650
the the contents that are visible, the handle size, the handle position.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.350
Its got some external actors for the user and the file system.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.190
Its got some events indicating the user what the user can do to

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.230
affect the text browser, and I've also put into the image into the diagram some

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.620
real mode comments which are the rectangles with the dog eared corners on them.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.290
Note that there are some certain subtleties that haven't included in

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.310
here such as how we're going to deal with zero length files and so on.
