00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.680
IC, or the information coefficient,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.410
is just the correlation of the manager's
forecast to actual returns.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.580
So for instance, if she made a forecast
on IBM, that it would go up 1%,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.230
and it went up 0.5%, well,
it's a positive correlation.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.768
This value can range from 0,
where the correlation is not present,

00:00:23.768 --> 00:00:27.560
to 1, where it's very, very strong.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.530
Finally, BR, or

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.730
breadth, represents the number of
trading opportunities per year.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.420
So for example, if you're Warren Buffet,
and you hold 120 stocks, and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.905
you just hold them all year,
that's 120 trading opportunities.

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:49.400
If, say, you're Jim Simons, and
you trade 100,000 times per day,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.460
you multiply that times the number
of trading days in a year, well,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.680
it turns out to be a very large number.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.620
Key thing is, even if it's just
a portfolio where you buy and

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.290
hold, you count the number of positions
in that portfolio as the number of

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.440
trading opportunities, because this
is oriented around an annual measure.
