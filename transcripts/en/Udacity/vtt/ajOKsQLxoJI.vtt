00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] Next, I'd like you to play with the noise.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Our class robot has built-in noise variables.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
One is for forward motion.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is the added Gaussian noise variable to the motion you command.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The same for turn and the same for the sensor measurements.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And as I scroll down I find the function set noise

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
let's me set those values to values other than zero.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, I want you to--into your code--set these values as follows:

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
forward noise equals 5.0, turn noise equals 0.1, and sense noise equals 5.0.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.999
So, please fit this into your code.
