00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.176
Now we'd also like to have a sound object that we can pass around or attach to

00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:10.454
various entities in the rest of the game code. Say, for instance, that some

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:11.722
entity has a specific

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:12.104
[NOISE]

00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:17.708
death sound that always plays. We'd want to be able to actually attach that to

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:23.850
that entity. As you can see here, we have a sound object that has two methods,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:32.210
init, and play. Init, initializes the sound in any way we might need to. Play

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.935
takes a boullian loop that plays a sound and playSoundInstance, which is an

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:41.810
external function used by both init and play, is a fire and forget version that

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:49.565
takes a sound URL, loads it, and then immediately plays it. Now, we want you to

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:54.945
fill in these methods as described with everything we've already built. And

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:57.000
that should only be a few lines of code.
