We know that the ratio for the parchment is 0.795 times the ratio for plants

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:12.114
today, which is 1 in 10 to the 12th. So we need to multiply 0.795 times 1 over

00:00:12.114 --> 00:00:19.385
10 to the 12th. Now this number is just 10 to the negative 12. So we have 0.795

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:23.093
times 10 to the negative 12.
