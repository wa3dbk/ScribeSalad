00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.730
How do you find for
the outsourcing vendors.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.220
That's one million dollar question.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.620
It's so hard to find them.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.290
It's even harder than hiring,
because basically,

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.570
you are interested in finding someone
that will do the job that you need to do

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.920
right now in a cheaper price but
hopefully in a better quality.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.680
And this is hard.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.670
And a lot of off showing
professional are still

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.190
struggling with finding
the perfect vendor.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.410
Because you need the job to be perfect,
or at least like in very good standards.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.050
You need them to be there for
you at all times, to be responsive.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.380
You need them to be aware of costs.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.440
You need them to be cost effective.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.260
And you need them to really work with
you, and share the culture with you.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.800
And finding this perfect fit for
the long term can be very challenging.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.420
And the best ways to find an outsourcer

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.410
is [INAUDIBLE] to the best ways to
find a new employee or a new partner.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.330
You're going to your friends,
to your colleagues,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.560
to people you value their opinion.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.890
And you're asking them,
who do you work with?

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.420
When did you have a good
experience with an outsourcer?

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.620
You're going to events and
you're trying to find professionals

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.779
that are the similar to you,
that are using outsourcing services.

00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:25.480
Or you're getting lucky basically.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.000
You're working with Elance or oDesk and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.490
you're trying to in you're
starting to test them.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.210
You're doing a lot of professional
exams, grace periods, you basically

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.450
testing the waters and then eventually
choosing one and that that's what I did.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.540
I worked with a lot of outsourcing
companies along the years.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.910
And about a year ago,

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.550
I found an outsourcing company
that now I can call my partners.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:59.910
And I'm working with them
like they were in my team.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.260
It's about twelve people.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.380
We're doing a lot of stuff every day.
