Thanks for that example Susan. Now it's explicit memory that really requires us

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:08.170
to have ability to retrieve information. For example, you're going to need to

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.635
retrieve what you've learned from this lesson to pass the problem set to the

00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:16.308
exam. However, there's often times that we don't encode the information

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:21.380
properly. Or we don't store it properly so it can't be retrieved. And as we're

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.368
going to see, sometimes people will retrieve information that's incorrect. This

00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:29.370
is termed False Memories. Now, false memories are memories of events that never

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.010
actually happened. Elizabeth Loftus is a pioneer in the research on false

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.658
memories. One study she did was had participants listen to a fictitious story

00:00:38.658 --> 00:00:44.328
of being lost in a shopping mall. A family member of the participant would

00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:48.090
describe this event to them, and 25% of the participants remembered being lost

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.568
in a shopping mall. Even though that never actually happened. So what does this

00:00:54.568 --> 00:00:55.500
tell us about memory?
