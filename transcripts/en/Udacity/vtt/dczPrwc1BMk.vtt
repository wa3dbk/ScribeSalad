00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.350
I did say that I'm oversimplifying,
and there are a few other things.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.110
So there are a few other bits
that can go with this other

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.798
information that we are talking about.

00:00:08.798 --> 00:00:12.650
In particular, there's an interesting
thing called setuid, and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.180
maybe we want to talk
about this a little bit.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.870
Think about a game program that
needs to update a file that

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.670
stores the scores of different
people who have played this game.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.420
So when these people are playing
the game, of course,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.690
we want to be able to update that file.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.800
When your score increases you want to
update your score that's in there.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.700
So, these users while playing the game,
and they play the game,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.100
need to have write access to that file.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.770
When they're not playing the game,
we don't want them to have write access

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.640
because then they can go change
the score without playing the game, so

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.640
we don't want that.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.650
So how can we solve this problem?

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.290
These systems I'm talking about,

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.660
this problem is solved by having
something called a setuid bit.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.210
So the way to understand this
is that we have Alice and

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.786
Bob, and Bob owns the game file,
and Alice wants to play the game.

00:01:04.786 --> 00:01:09.340
So the game file is actually owned by
Bob, and Bob is going to give permission

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.200
to Alice to execute,
being able to execute this file.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.270
By the way, the score file is also,
Bob is going to own the score, and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.570
is not going to grant write
access to Alice because

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.060
Alice should not be able to update that
file unless she's playing the game.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.940
So you can think about the score file,
Alice can read it, her score and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.720
somebody else's score, how people
are doing, but she can't write it.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.630
Bob can rewrite it because Bob owns
the game file that we have here.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.610
He's some special user, or someone who
is running this program that we have.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.548
People who want to play the game.

00:01:42.548 --> 00:01:47.890
So, setuid bit is set on the game file,
the executable file that we have.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.670
And we said Alice executes this file
when she wants to play the game.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.920
So setuid bit,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.710
when it's set on executable file,
actually does an interesting thing.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.760
When Alice executes this file,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.620
the User ID temporarily
changes it from Alice to Bob.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.060
So it says when a setuid file
is executed, the User ID,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.500
effective User ID, at that point is not
the user who actually executed the file,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.890
but is owner of this file.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.320
In this case,
the owner of the file is Bob.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.400
So during the execution of the game,
although Alice is playing the game,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.310
during the execution of the game, the
temporary or effective UID is Bob, and

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.070
because of that,
even though Alice is playing the game,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.930
she is able to update the file.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.250
File is updated back that
is in this game file.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.170
And while we're executing the game file,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.330
as we said,
the effective User ID becomes Bob.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.550
Alice launched this program, but
the program is owned by somebody else.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.770
This change in UID is possible when
the executable file that Alice executes,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.920
the game file here,
has a setuid bit set.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.770
So a setuid bit is used to change the
UID temporarily during the execution of

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.170
the program on which this bit is set,
and I hope I motivated why you may want

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.740
to do that, in this case, for example,
the game file that we are talking about.
