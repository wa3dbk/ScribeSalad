00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.103
Once again, we have a rational function with a fascinating graph. It never

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:08.781
crosses the line x equals 2, or the line y equals 1 half. Let me take a second

00:00:08.781 --> 00:00:13.260
to draw them on here. Here we have the line x equals 2. We can see that on

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.875
either side of it, the graph is getting closer and closer. But it's never going

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:21.582
to actually touch the line. This is called a vertical asymptote. Let's look at

00:00:21.582 --> 00:00:26.430
y equals 1 half, and there we go! This is called a horizontal asymptote.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.832
Similarly, on either side, the graph is getting closer and closer but never

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:33.800
actually touching it. We're going to talk a lot more about these kinds of

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.029
asymptotes and others in the next couple of lessons.
