00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first I'm going to talk about the strategy for my solution, and then I'm going to show you the code.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, I said before that a bad strategy would be to start at the front

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and then when we find the palindrome, try to extend it by extending onto the end.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Why is that bad?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Because just knowing that the first characters of a substring

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
is a palindrome doesn't tell you anything by expanding it by adding characters onto one end.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There's another way to look at it where it does work.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If we start in the middle, then we can expand

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and then every time we move out we are gaining some information.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's say that instead of starting here we started here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We say is c by itself a palindrome?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Well, yes, it is, because every one-character string is a palindrome.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Then instead of going only forward, we go 1 character in both directions.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now we're looking at bcb, and say is that a palindrome?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Yes it is. Now we can go out again in both directions.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Abcba--is that a palindrome? Yes.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We keep on growing the solution out from the middle in both directions.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We keep on going as long as we can and find

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the longest palindrome that's centered on one of these positions.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
As soon as we find something that's not a palindrome--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
let's say if instead of a here there was an x--then we can stop.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
No matter how long the string is, no matter how many characters are here and here,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
we know that nothing centered on the c is going to be a palindrome that's any longer than that.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We can eliminate a lot of the work.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That's the advantage of doing this.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
What about the starting positions?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Well, we've got to start with every character being the center,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and then we also have to start with between every character being the center.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Maybe the longest palindrome in the string is just a two-character sequence.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
If we only looked at the first one and then went out to the side we wouldn't find it.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
If we start by looking in between them--in other words, start not with "b" but with the empty string--

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
then when we move out in both directions from the empty string then we check "bb."

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
That's my approach for the strategy.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If you didn't get the question right, why don't you try it again.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Try to implement this strategy before you look at my solution.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now I'll show you what I did.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The key to this function is the grow function.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
How do you grow a potential palindrome from the middle out?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Grow is going to a text, a start, and an end position,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
which the end is going to be either 0 or 1 more than the start,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
then we keep on going until we hit the end.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
While the start is greater than 0, the start of the string, and while the end

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is less than the end of the string and while they match,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
while the character 1 to the left is equal to the character 1 to the right,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
but we allow for one of them to be in a different case.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
If that's true, then we grow by expanding the start to the left and expanding the end to the right.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We keep on doing that as long as we can and then we return the start and the end.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That's the grow function.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
That'll find you the longest sequence that is centered on a particular text

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
with a particular start and end.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Then longest<u>subpalindrome</u>slice just goes through all the possibilities.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It tries to grow for every possible start and end location.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Then we just take the maximum length out of all of those candidates

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
where the length of a slice is just the different between the two.
