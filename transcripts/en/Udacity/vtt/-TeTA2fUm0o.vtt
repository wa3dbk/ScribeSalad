00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.468
Recall that we have at least two ways in which we can deal with your stressful

00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:09.840
situations. One, is problem focus coping and the other is emotion focus coping.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.272
Recall that with problem focused coping, we looked for strategies to solve the

00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:18.500
problem and therefore, reduce our stress. With emotion focus coping, we look at

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.800
ways in which we can reduce the negative emotional response that we experience

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.100
to stress. Now, we discussed a variety of emotion-focused coping responses.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.345
Social support is one way in which we can reduce the negative emotional

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:36.930
responses that we feel in regards to stress. Therefore, talking with friends or

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.414
family about stressful situations or predicaments in which we find ourselves,

00:00:40.414 --> 00:00:45.908
can go a long way in reducing our overall stress levels. This in turn we know

00:00:45.908 --> 00:00:50.920
is important for our overall brain health and immune system functioning.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.160
Therefore, we want to avoid long term exposure to stress because we know

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.400
cortisol has a negative effect on the hippocampus and our immune system

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.852
functioning. Now, we're going to move on and see how stress affects our health,

00:01:02.852 --> 00:01:05.830
and Greg's going to introduce that topic for us.
