00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.080
In Chrome Dev Tools,
there are two records that you might see

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.070
relating to layers or
composite to layers.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.810
The first one is Update Layer Tree,
which happens when Chrome's internal

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.705
engine, called Blink, figures out
what layers are needed for the page.

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:19.180
It looks at the styles of
the elements and tries to figure out

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.946
what order everything should be in and
how many layers it needs.

00:00:22.946 --> 00:00:26.505
Composite Layers is the other
record where the browser is now

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:30.025
putting the page together
to send to the screen.

00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:31.631
The more layers you have,

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:35.647
the more time will be spent in
layer management and compositing.

00:00:35.647 --> 00:00:38.651
So there's a tradeoff between
reducing paint time, and

00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:40.600
increasing layer management time.
