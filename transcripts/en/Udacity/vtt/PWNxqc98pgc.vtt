00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.290
These are Android Wear watches.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.490
The first thing that you'll notice
is that they don't look like other

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.580
Android devices.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.650
Now this is key,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.720
because they are used differently than
other devices like a phone or tablet.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.030
The UI is different.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.680
They're worn,
instead of put pocket, and so on.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.540
The second you'll notice is that
these watches are as diverse as

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.530
the broad set of users who wear them.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.450
You might be dealing
with a square screen, or

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.520
a round screen, your user might
be a runner or might be a pilot.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.920
Instead of fighting these issues,
embrace them by designing an app

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.320
that works great on any watch and
in any situation that makes sense.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.530
The good news is that from the
perspective of actually writing code,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.020
these watches look very similar
to Android phones and tablet's.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.800
Much of the underlying
software is exactly the same.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.340
Even the hardware is basically the same
with similar senses and functionality.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.880
So once you learn all the new
paradigms of designing for

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.430
a wearable, you can jump in a familiar
Android territory to build it.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.660
&gt;&gt; In this introductory lesson,
I'll give you an overview of the design

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.700
philosophy and
platform components of Android Wear.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.560
But first, let's start with the demo.
