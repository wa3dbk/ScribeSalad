00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.650
This first ones incorrect. As n increase the standard error decreases. With a

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.742
greater sample size we have less error. The t-distribution does approach a

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:13.838
normal distribution. And as it approaches a normal distribution it gets

00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:20.993
skinnier in the tails. And also, as n increases, then s approaches sigma.
