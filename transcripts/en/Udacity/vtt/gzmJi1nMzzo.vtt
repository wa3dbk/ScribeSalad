00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.590
So as a quick quiz, which of the

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.440
following are examples of control plane operations? Computing

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.600
a forwarding path, that satisfies some high-level policy

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.490
such as an access control policy, computing a

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.240
shortest path routing tree, rate-limiting traffic so that

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.550
the overall sending rate doesn't exceed a certain

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.390
throughput Load balancing traffic based on a hash

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.650
of the packet source IP address, or authenticating

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.630
a user's device based on its MAC address. Please check all options that apply.
