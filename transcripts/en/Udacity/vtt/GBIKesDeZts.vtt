00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.294
For the Sleeping in the Library app,

00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:06.240
we're going to use
the flickr.galleries.getPhotos method.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.160
Let's play around with this method
in the Flickr's API explorer before

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.760
we start coding.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.480
Aside from the API key, this method
only has one required argument,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.374
the gallery_id.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.881
I've gone ahead and copy the gallery_id
you'll use in this project and

00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:26.547
pasted it in.

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.180
Like before, we need to provide
url_m in the extras argument.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.910
Otherwise theirs responsible had URLs
for the images we want to display.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.881
Now let's call the method.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.170
This is strange.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.289
This doesn't quite look like what we had
with my public photo stream when we were

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:52.280
testing earlier.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.190
And that's because we forgot to
change the response format to JSON,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.390
and we're currently looking
at an XML response.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.662
Now you'll notice the XML looks quite
similar to JSON, and I'm showing this on

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:06.849
purpose to again reinforce
the idea that data can be sent and

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:09.799
received in many different
formats over the network.

00:01:12.175 --> 00:01:14.673
Let's switch this back to JSON and
then call the method again.

00:01:17.968 --> 00:01:20.044
Now this is what we expected.

00:01:20.044 --> 00:01:25.126
These results are almost identical to
what we saw with my public photo stream.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:27.467
But how are we going to get
this data loaded into our app?

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:37.349
Well, my recommendation is that
we start with the URL itself,

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.380
the one that we see here on the bottom.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.150
Let's copy it and
look at it piece by piece.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.425
Everything leading up to
the question mark specifies the API.

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:56.992
Then after the question mark,

00:01:56.992 --> 00:02:01.580
we have a series of argument names
followed by equal signs and their value.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.030
Each argument value pair is
separated also by an ampersand.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.474
I'm going to fix this URL by removing
the last argument value because it's

00:02:11.474 --> 00:02:13.335
only necessary in the API explorer.

00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:19.094
For the Sleeping In The Library app we
just need these argument value pairs.

00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:21.719
And remember,
when you build your version of the app,

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.800
you'll need to use your own API
key because the one provided here

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.219
is just a temporary one
given by the API explorer.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:35.848
Now let's test a URL like this using
the Postman tool that we saw earlier.

00:02:35.848 --> 00:02:36.870
And the results look good.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.740
These are essentially the same results
that we had in the API explorer,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.970
except they're formatted
a little bit nicer.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.830
And with that I think we're ready
to get started doing this in code.
