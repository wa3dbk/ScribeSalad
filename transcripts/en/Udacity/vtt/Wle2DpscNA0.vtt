00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.410
It is almost all of the above.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.510
jQuery does add a few kilobytes to the size of your pages, so

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.890
it will add a minute amount of time to your page loads.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.481
But, given all of the syntactical sugar you gain,

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:16.990
most developers are more than happy to add it to their Web sites.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.870
On a personal note, I want to add that while I was making this class,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.420
my opinion about jQuery actually changed a little bit.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.670
I generally tend to use just plain old JavaScript to do

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.060
DOM manipulation because I don't want to add the extra kilobytes to my pages.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.270
But honestly, after doing the research in developing this class and

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.630
spending more and more and more time with jQuery, it really is pretty awesome.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.670
So, I'm going to go ahead and draw a smiley face here.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.340
It's an ugly smiley face, but that's how I'm feeling right now.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.860
So, good job for finishing, guys.
