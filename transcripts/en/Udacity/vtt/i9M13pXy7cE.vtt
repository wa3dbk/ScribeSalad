00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.788
We just discussed some behavioral aspects of treatment such as token economies

00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:09.076
and systematic desensitization, but let's touch on cognitive therapy and then

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:15.186
see how the 2 are combined. Cognitive therapies any type of cycle therapy that

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:20.320
works to restructure Irrational thought patterns. Here, the therapist will talk

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.960
to the client in an attempt to identify irrational thought patterns, and then

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.006
the therapist will actually challenge the client on those thoughts. For

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:33.222
example, perhaps the client tells the therapist, I'm fat, ugly, smelly, stupid,

00:00:33.222 --> 00:00:38.116
and nobody loves me. The therapist would challenge her on those irrational

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:42.087
thoughts. She may, for example, ask the client Is it really the case that

00:00:42.087 --> 00:00:46.506
nobody loves you? You have the support of your family, your friends, and your

00:00:46.506 --> 00:00:50.743
boyfriend. And they've all contributed in some way to help you through this

00:00:50.743 --> 00:00:54.260
depression that you're experiencing. And that's challenging the clients

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.725
thoughts. Now challenging a person to look at their irrational thoughts in a

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:02.689
logical way, can perhaps change a persons thought patterns.
