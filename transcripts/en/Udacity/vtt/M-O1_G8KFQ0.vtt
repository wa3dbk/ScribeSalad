00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.698
Here, the dimensions of the rectangle are 8 inches by 4 inches. Great thinking

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:09.423
if you found these numbers. We begin solving by starting with an equation for

00:00:09.423 --> 00:00:14.352
the perimeter and the equation for the area. We know the value of the perimeter

00:00:14.352 --> 00:00:20.270
here. The perimeter is 24 inches, so we can replace P with 24. For the area

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.420
equation, we know A equals l times w. We can replace it this value of A with

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.484
its numerical value, 32. Now that we have these two equations, we want to solve

00:00:30.484 --> 00:00:35.613
this one for the value of l. So we can use substitution to solve. We'll divide

00:00:35.613 --> 00:00:39.393
each term by 2 to get 12 equals l plus w, and then we'll subtract w from both

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:45.665
sides to get 12 minus w equals l. And now, here comes the substitution. We

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:51.353
replace l with this expression, 12 minus w here. We multiply each term in the

00:00:51.353 --> 00:00:58.062
parentheses by w to get 32 equals 12w minus w squared. Then, to solve this

00:00:58.062 --> 00:01:01.968
quadratic, we move these terms to the opposite side of the equation to set it

00:01:01.968 --> 00:01:07.902
equal to 0. We factor this quadratic by finding factors at positive 32 at sum

00:01:07.902 --> 00:01:13.655
to negative 12. Those factors are negative 8 and negative 4. And finally, we

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:18.840
set each factor equal to 0, so w can equal positive 8 or w can equal positive

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.423
4. We know the width should be the shorter dimension, so that will be 4 and our

00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:28.408
length would be 8. Our unit of measurement is in inches on all sides and we can

00:01:28.408 --> 00:01:34.503
quickly check to verify the perimeter and area for our problem. If we add up

00:01:34.503 --> 00:01:39.890
all the sides around the object, we'll get 24 inches. So yes, that checks with

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.860
our original problem. And if we multiply the length times the width, 8 times 4

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.626
equals 32 inches squared, which was our original area. Now, it's okay if you

00:01:51.626 --> 00:01:54.990
didn't get all of this, but hopefully, you made your way at least to the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.450
factoring. Great job if so.
