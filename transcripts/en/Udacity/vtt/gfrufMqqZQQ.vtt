00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.070
Now, one of the reasons
that apps have often failed

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.100
is that they didn't respond
well to their target audience.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.050
All of the audiences you might be
presenting to are going to be well

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.320
aware of that fact.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.040
And so, it will be an asset to
you to present evidence from your

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.500
user research.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.240
This is the secondary reason
we've been saving all of this.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.260
It allows us to show direct quotations
in text, audio, or video from users.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.340
If you can show that your prototype is
changed in response to user feedback,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.030
you can show that your at least
willing to adapt to the market.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.240
Which is key to having your app be
successful across a more diverse

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.460
customer group later on.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.440
What this looks like is largely up to
you, but there are some big no-nos.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.140
Don't focus on all the ways in which
you've gotten it wrong, instead make it

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.670
clear that these are ways that your
app has gotten better over time.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.670
Also, try not to show too many
responses from the same user.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.040
It's very easy to focus on the most
eloquent user in each test, but

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.560
if you do, you'll be building an app for

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.640
that user in particular rather
than your target market generally.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.790
With as many prototyping
iterations as you've been doing,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.090
you should have a wide range of
users who have discussed your app.
