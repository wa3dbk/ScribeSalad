00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.744
There are some special right triangles that can help us problem solve even more

00:00:03.744 --> 00:00:08.112
quickly than using the Pythagorean Theorem. If you were able to solve the last

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:12.570
problem without using the Pythagorean Theorem, then great work. If you didn't,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.090
I would go back and check that solution, see how we can do it. For the last

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.681
problem, we could actually use this special ratio 3 to 4 to 5 to find a missing

00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:25.894
side length. If the side lengths are on the ratio of 3 to 4 to 5, then any

00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:31.742
multiple of that would also be a right triangle. So, if I multiplied each of

00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:38.402
these by 2, I could also have a 6, 8, 10 right triangle. We know this is a

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:44.659
right triangle since 6 squared is 36, 8 squared is 64, and 10 squared is 100. A

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:50.641
squared plus b squared equals c squared. So multiplying through by any number

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:55.170
for this ratio would give us a right triangle. We could multiply through by 3

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.812
to get a different right triangle. In fact, that triangle would be a 9-12-15

00:01:00.812 --> 00:01:05.754
right triangle. So by knowing a special right triangle, we can generate an

00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:10.520
infinite amount of larger right triangles. That's why this ratio is so

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.801
important. In fact, it's called a Pythagorean Triple. There are a couple of

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:18.349
Pythagorean Triples that appear often enough that it's helpful to know these.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.004
If you're able to quickly recognize these, then you can easily find missing

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:28.284
side links. For example if we had this right triangle that had a leg of 35. And

00:01:28.284 --> 00:01:34.110
a hypotenuse of 125 units. What would be this missing leg? Now you could use a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.467
pythagorean theorem to solve for this missing leg. But I really want you to

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:42.702
think about this in terms of ratios. Which of these ratios can help you find

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:47.120
this missing leg. Choose the one that you think it corresponds to and then fill

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.600
in the missing number based on the multiplier. Good luck.
