00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.560
So of course, traditionally, photographers used the aperture, shutter, and

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.820
focal length values of the camera to extensively be able to define how

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.940
they want to be able to take, and what kind of pictures they want to take.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.520
I'm just going to show you a few examples that I found just to kind of

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.090
show the value of this kind of stuff.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.010
Here, shallow depth of field is shown by how the pictures are taken,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.510
things are right there are perfectly in focus.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.560
These are not that far behind, but they seem to be a little bit out of focus.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.870
So this is the concept of shallow depth of field.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.560
Motion blur, here you can see, for

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.220
example, the birds are showing motion because of shutter speed changes.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.580
You can see that the wings are blurred.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.790
Here you can see the hand is blurred but the text is not.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.100
And of course traditional effects of light streaking at nights and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.670
stuff like are again because shutter is kept open a little longer.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.200
And of course when the cars move have this impact.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.580
And, of course, there's a whole tradition of people doing light art.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.350
I found this beautiful site that I point here that actually if you want you

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.110
can look at on your own.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.650
It shows a lot of fun things that you can do with just how you can control and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.940
how you can play around with light.
