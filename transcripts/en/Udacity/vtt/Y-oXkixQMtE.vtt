00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.320
Now let's see how this whole thing works in practice by

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.800
using an example. We're going to consider a program that takes as

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.450
input a text file and produce it as output, a filtered

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.170
file. So basically it outputs a subset of the content of

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.928
this text file based on some filter. And we're going to have

00:00:16.928 --> 00:00:19.440
four different types of filters. So the first one is

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.680
not filtering which means that the whole content of the text

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.320
file will be produced on the output. The second filter will output

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.990
only words that starts with t. So you'll take the text file

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.540
and simply ignore all of the words that do not start with

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.130
t. So in the output we'll have only those words that starts

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.030
with letter t. The third filter will produce in the output only

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.180
words that are longer than five characters. So all the other words

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.740
will be simply disregarded. And finally, the four filter will produce as

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.630
output only words in the text file that are palindromes, and in

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.590
case you don't know what a palindrome is, a palindrome is a word

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.700
that is the same whether you read it from left

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.800
to right or from right to left. For example, the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.480
word kayak, you can read it in this direction, or

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.740
in this direction, and it's exactly the same word. So

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.560
let's see how this program could be implemented using a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.980
strategy pattern. And let's do it for real as a

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.100
demo. What we're looking at here is the editor page

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.520
for Eclipse, open with the strategy pattern implementation for our example.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.130
So what I'm going to do is that, I'm going to look at a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.310
different part of implementation. And you will see that, you know, despite

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.420
the fact that it's slightly longer, it's really fairly simple, it's kind

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.230
of a straightforward implementation of what we just saw. As I just

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.820
said, what we are doing is basically building the strategy patterns that

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.330
allows for changing the strategies with which we're filtering an input file.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.380
And we have different strategies, we'll look at those in detail, and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.050
we said that the three participants for this pattern are the context,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.650
the algorithm, which is the general interface and then the concrete

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.270
strategies, which are the concrete implementations of this algorithm. So let's

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.790
start by looking at the context. Which is this class here.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.960
And as you can see it contains a reference at the current

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.240
strategy. We call this the check strategy, which is basically our

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.910
filter, and when the context is created by default it sets a

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.890
strategy to the old strategy. The old strategy is the one

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.380
that accepts all the input, so basically it doesn't filter out anything.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.320
And we said that the context is the interface to the

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.889
outside world, right? So it has to provide the outside world

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.140
with a way of selecting the strategy, the specific algorithm to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.850
be used, and it does that in this case by providing

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.360
this change strategy method. This method takes a strategy as input,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.930
and simply replaces the current strategy with the one specified as

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.035
a parameter. And at this point, the context also will perform

00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:31.830
the filtering. The filtering is pretty straightforward, so what it does is

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.620
that it opens a file that is passed as a parameter

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.450
so that this the file, the input file to be filtered. And

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.560
then it reads the file line by line and then splits

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.620
the lines into its composing words and then for each word in

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.480
each line, what it will do, it will basically invoke the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.270
check method in the current strategy, which is basically the filtering method

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.580
and if the check method returns true, which basically means that

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.150
the word should be printed, it prints the word. Otherwise, it'll just

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.480
skip it. So basically the filter will return false for all the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.470
words that have to be filtered out. Okay? This is the basic

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.770
way in which context works. Let's see how this is used in

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.660
our main method. The main method simply creates the context, reads the input file

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.910
from the arguments, and then what he does is simply as a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.720
demonstration, it will perform the filtering using all the different filters. So

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.310
starting from the default one, which is the one that basically doesn't

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.150
do any filtering that reports all words, then it will switch to the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.400
algorithm, that only considers the words that start with t, and

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.880
it will do that by invoking a change strategy and passing this

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.890
strategy as the argument, and then

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.760
performing the actual filtering through context.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.040
And it will do exactly the same for the strategy that only

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.540
prints words that are longer than five and the one that

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.460
only prints words that are palindromes. So now let's look at the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.090
actual algorithm. This is the interface, the algorithm interface. And you can

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.080
see that the only thing that the interface provides is this method,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.760
which is the check method, that takes a string as input and will

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.470
return a boolean. So, basically, it's the boolean that we were seeing before.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.010
The one that is true for the words that have to be printed

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.490
and false for the ones that have to be filtered out. Now, we have

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.250
all the different implementations of the algorithm, the simplest one is the all

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.110
algorithm, the simple return is always true, so all the words will be printed.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.740
The second one starts with t, and again, without looking at the details

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.660
of implementations that don't really matter, what

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.390
it does is basically check that

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.111
the first character is t, and returns true in that case and

00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:17.720
false otherwise. Similarly, for the LongerThan5

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.380
algorithm, also in this case, this

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.000
will implement the check strategy interface, and the check will be performed

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.980
by checking that the word is longer than five characters and returning

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.440
true in that case and false otherwise. And finally the Palindrome check

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.240
is a little more complicated, but basically it just checks whether the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.190
word is a Palindrome and returns true in that case. Okay, so

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.950
as I said, it doesn't really matter too much what is the specific

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.630
implementations of these matters. What matters is that we have

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.150
a general interface for the algorithm and then any different concrete

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.130
implementations of the algorithm that implement different strategies. So again,

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.730
this allows you to change the behavior of your class without

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.420
changing class. So we have this context class that does

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.015
different things when the filter method in invoked, depending on what

00:04:57.015 --> 00:04:59.930
is the current strategy. So the behavior of the class can

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.310
change dynamically, and it changes dynamically every time that we change

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.300
the strategy. At this point, the way this whole thing works should

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.430
be clear, so what we're going to do is that we're going to go to

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.010
our console, and we're actually going to run the strategy pattern and see

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.710
what happens. So here I have a file, it's called foo.txt. And if

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.290
we look at the content of foo, you can see that it

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.190
says that this is just a test to assess how well this program

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.430
performs when used on files of text. And since it checks for

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.560
palindromes, we will also insert one such word, level. Level is a palindrome,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.042
because you can read it from both sides. Okay, so let's

00:05:31.042 --> 00:05:33.657
see what happens when we run our code. So we're going to

00:05:33.657 --> 00:05:36.900
run java pattern.strategy.StrategyPattern which is

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.550
our class, and we going to fetch

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.460
foo.txt as an input, and let's go back to the beginning

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.980
of the output to see what happened exactly. You can see

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.040
here that for the default strategy, which was the old strategy,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.810
the whole file is printed, so every word is printed. This

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.485
is just a test to assess and so on and so forth,

00:05:53.485 --> 00:05:57.290
as expected. For the filter that only prints words that

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.230
start with t, only words that start with t are printed,

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.180
again, as expected. Similarly, for the filter that only prints words

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.970
that are longer than 5, and finally for the one that prints

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.540
palindromes. And here you can see that we actually have two

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.410
because the way in which this is implemented we'll also consider

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.300
single letter words as palindromes because you can read them from

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.450
both sides. But you definitely will also have level in the output.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.040
And in case you want to play with this code yourself, I

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.600
have made this code and also the implementation for examples of other

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.440
design partners available as a compressed archive. And the archive is accessible

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.120
through a URL that is provided in the notes for the cost.
