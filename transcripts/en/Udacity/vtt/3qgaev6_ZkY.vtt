00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.035
Welcome to lesson two everybody. In this lesson we're going to learn

00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:06.210
about forms. Forms you've seen all over the place on the internet.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.178
They're the text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons that basically allow

00:00:10.178 --> 00:00:14.540
websites to get information from users, including on [UNKNOWN] own site. Every

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.506
quiz you do is submitting a form. So we are going to

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:20.368
spend a lot of time, basically learning how to build this things

00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:22.817
in your editor in a browser testing them out. And we're

00:00:22.817 --> 00:00:25.308
also going to spend time learning how to make sure the data you're

00:00:25.308 --> 00:00:27.704
getting from the user is actually secure. Because this is

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:30.122
how you let the users basically into your website. So

00:00:30.122 --> 00:00:32.362
we have to make sure that we only allow them

00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:34.900
do what we want them to do. So, let's get started.
