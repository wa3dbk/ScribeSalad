00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.220
Let's continue using our equation solving skills to tackle some other problems.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.650
This time we're going to try motion problems. The primary concept we're dealing

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.834
with, with motion problems is distance equals rate times time. For any object

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:19.040
that moves at a constant rate. We can find the distance that it travels by

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.118
multiplying its rate by its time. The time is how long the object is traveling

00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:28.650
at that given rate. So, let's say a car is traveling at 60 miles per hour and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.720
it traveled for 2 hours. Well, that means in 1 hour it goes 60 miles, so in 2

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.981
hours it goes double that, which is 120 miles. This formula should make sense,

00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:45.923
and the units down here should also make sense. We know if we multiply miles

00:00:45.923 --> 00:00:50.396
per hour times the number of hour, our hours will cancel leaving us with just

00:00:50.396 --> 00:00:57.374
miles. So if we know that distance equals rate times time. What equations could

00:00:57.374 --> 00:01:02.098
we write for the rate and for the time? In other words, I want you to solve

00:01:02.098 --> 00:01:06.986
this equation for r and write the expression here. And then solve this equation

00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:09.360
for t, and write that expression here.
