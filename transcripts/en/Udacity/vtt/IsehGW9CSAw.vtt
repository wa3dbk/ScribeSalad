00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And what's cool about this algorithm is it finds the Top K elements in no particular order

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in Î˜(n) independent of K.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now remember, the best that we could do for the previous algorithm is if K is large

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we ended up using sorting which is n log n.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is always Î˜(n) or at least expected top running time.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The worst case can be bad, but there's a way of fixing that as well.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is pretty remarkable, and you might find this to be quite counter-intuitive.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For example, if the list has n elements in it, it takes us n log n time to sort it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
How could it take us less than that to find the Top K if k = n?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Well, it's actually this phrase here that's really important. In no particular order.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Basically, if you ask me to find the top 100 elements in a list of like 100,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I don't have to do anything, right. I can just give you back the original list even if it's not sorted.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The top 100 is exactly these elements. This is what you asked for.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That's why this is not actually equivalent to sorting.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It can be actually much more efficient than sorting.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now, what happens in the case where we're looking for the top half?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It seems a little trickier, right?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
In the top half case, we can still do this in linear time even though sorting the whole list

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
is the natural way to do this to split the top half and the bottom half and that takes n log n.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The key step to this algorithm is going to be the following simple subproblem.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Kind of interesting maybe but a slightly counter-intuitive problem.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And that is finding the rank of a given value in a sorted list.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We're given L unsorted and we're given the value of V and we'd like to find out

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
where V would appear if L were sorted.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's not sorted but if it were sorted where would this value V appear on the list.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now just for the simplicity of the discussion for now

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
let's assume that all the values in the list are distinct.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We're imagining here we've got our list L and we pick out some value V.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It doesn't actually have to be in the list but let's say it's in the list

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and what we want to know is where would V appear in L

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
if L were sorted say smallest to largest?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now, one way to solve this problem of course is to sort L and then look for V.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But the insight here is that we don't need to do nearly that much work. So how do we do it?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Let's look at a concrete example. Here's L. This is an unsorted list of unique numbers.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
They're all 2 digit numbers just for my own sanity in writing them down.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And then this is the sorted list L. It's the same elements but I've put them in order.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And let's consider number 66 say. So here's 66 in the original list.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
How can we figure out just by scanning through L where 66 is going to end up in this list?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Well what makes it end up there. It's in position what? 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
It's in position 8. So why is it in position 8?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Well, it's in position 8 because there are exactly 8 elements in the list that are smaller than 66.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Right? Because once it's sorted, those 8 elements are going to be to its left

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and that's what's going to put 66 in the 8th position.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
We can just go through this list making note of the elements that are smaller than 66.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:27.000
31. 45. Not 91. Yes 51. Not 82. Yes 28. Yes 33. Yes 11. No. No. Yes. Yes.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
For a total of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 7, 8 elements.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
That's how we can know where 66 is going to be in the sorted list

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
even if I don't tell you the sorted list in advance.
