00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.672
We can also write each of these square roots and each of these cubed roots in

00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:08.281
another way. We can use a fractional exponent or a rational exponent to write

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:13.497
them. Remember that the index here for these square roots is a 2. So using this

00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:17.370
index of 2 and this power of 1, we can rewrite the square root of 4 as 4 to the

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.445
1 half. The square root of 25 can be written as 25 to the 1 half. And the

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:28.260
square root of 81 can be written as 81 to the 1 half. So notice that this

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.670
fractional exponent really represents a radical, and in this case a square

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.115
root. We can write the cube root of 8 as 8 to the 1 3rd, and we can rewrite the

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:45.603
cubed root of 125 as 125 to the 1 3rd power. The same is true for 343. So, what

00:00:45.603 --> 00:00:51.124
does each part of the fractional exponent represent? Does the numerator

00:00:51.124 --> 00:01:02.139
represent a power, the index of the root, a square root, or a reciprocal? And

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.769
what does the denominator represent? Is it a power, an index of the root, a

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.931
square root, or a reciprocal? Use these same words for each of the answer

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:09.320
choices over here, and then pick one for this blank, and one for this blank.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.573
Good luck.
