00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.485
The slope of line A is negative. The slope of line B is 0, since it's

00:00:03.485 --> 00:00:07.651
horizontal. And the slope of line C is positive. This is pretty interesting. I

00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:11.746
think this gives us a different way of quantifying how the shape of our curve is

00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:15.723
symmetric. As we move from one side of our parabola across the vertex to the

00:00:15.723 --> 00:00:19.819
other side, the sign of the slopes of our tangent lines as we move from point to

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.956
point to point, switches direction. This is going to be true of any parabola.

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:28.054
Although, you can imagine that if this parabola flipped upside down, you might

00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:31.050
have filled in different answers for these three lines.
