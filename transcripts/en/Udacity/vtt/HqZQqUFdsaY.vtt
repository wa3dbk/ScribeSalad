00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.406
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; First we're going to consider just 8x squared plus 20x. In the two

00:00:04.406 --> 00:00:09.352
coefficients, there's a common factor of 4. And in the variables, there's a

00:00:09.352 --> 00:00:14.498
common factor of x. So we have 4x times what's left over in each term, 2x plus

00:00:14.498 --> 00:00:19.958
5. Wonderful. Now let's look at 6x plus 15. We can only consider it the constant

00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.968
parts of each term, since there's no variable portion of 15. And 6 and 15 are

00:00:24.968 --> 00:00:30.236
both divisible by 3. And then we're left with, surprise, 2x plus 5. Wonderful.

00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:35.404
So we have 4x times the quantity 2x plus 5 plus 3 times the quantity 2x plus 5.
