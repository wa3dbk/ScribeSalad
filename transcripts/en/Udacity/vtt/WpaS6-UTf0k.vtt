00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.540
My name is Steve, Steve Chen,
I am most well known for

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.620
being one of the co-founders
of YouTube and

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.770
one of the probably the earliest
employees of PayPal, PayPal link.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.830
And a little known fact I was also one
of the earliest engineers at Facebook

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.330
for about 3 months before so

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.720
that was kind of this in sandwich
between PayPal and starting YouTube.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.888
I was working at Facebook and so
in 2005 when I was filing my taxes,

00:00:29.888 --> 00:00:34.721
I was filing taxes with both PayPal,
Facebook and YouTube on it.

00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:37.022
And I don't think anybody else
can make that claim, ever.

00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:43.279
[LAUGH] I think for a while there, so
I left YouTube in about 2009, 2010.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.844
And probably for the first 12 months
there, was trying to figure out, because

00:00:49.844 --> 00:00:55.381
all throughout the twenties and even
early 30 was just working on startups.

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:59.530
And it was always the kind of, there's
no difference between Monday, Wednesday,

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.087
Saturday, Sunday there's no
difference between whatever, 9 AM and

00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:04.430
3 AM in the morning.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.860
And so I've been doing that for
over a decade,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.710
and I was always thinking throughout
that decade while I was having fun.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.990
There were all these other things
just starting to get into coffee and

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.920
photography and headphones and
just speakers and watching all these

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.600
movies that came out throughout all that
time that I never got a chance to watch.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.760
But after the first 12 months I just
realized that none of it is as fun

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.500
as kind of the challenge and
the excitement,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.910
the sort of just everything that
motivates people to start companies.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.150
Nothing really compares to that,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.330
so got back into starting a company and
so that's what I'm doing now.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.210
I went back to Google, Google Ventures
as an entrepreneur in residence for

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.680
about 18 months and
got the support from Google Ventures.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.500
And then just about a month and

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.350
a half ago in August of 2015, left
Google Ventures because we were ready

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.839
to start getting external funding and
doing our own hiring.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.905
With the early days of
YouTube started and

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:09.840
sort of in that 2005 time frame.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.602
I think that the idea and
domain name itself,

00:02:13.602 --> 00:02:19.056
we bought it on Valentine's Day,
so February 14th 2005.

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:22.155
There was another co-founder,
Chad Hurley,

00:02:22.155 --> 00:02:26.492
we were in Menlo Park California and
if you can imagine we search for

00:02:26.492 --> 00:02:29.990
a YouTube on Google and
zero results came up, right.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.760
And so we went out,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.760
bought the domain name youtube.com and
started talking about this site.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.720
The site itself originally the idea was,
it's a little embarrassing

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.450
to talk about but it was actually
supposed to be kind of a dating site.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.640
It was supposed to be a dating
site where instead of posting your

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.330
personal pictures and your personal
introduction you would post a video and

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.120
that would just aggregate
everything together.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.630
A little introduction to yourself but
you would actually see this person and

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.700
be able to interact with them.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.680
Which you know we started developing
all the back end was still more or

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.540
less the same as of what
you see with YouTube today.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.770
Being able to upload videos.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.110
Being able to transcode videos.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.970
Being able to embed these videos onto
different sites out there on to social

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.820
networking sites.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.010
And the development of the site
took about three months.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.646
And we launched in May of 2005.

00:03:24.646 --> 00:03:28.450
And for the first week,
it was a total flop.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.830
We didn't get a single video uploaded.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.640
That was within the category domain of

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.970
what we thought the site
was going to be.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.740
Nobody was introducing themselves
using the site as a video dating site.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.640
However, what we saw was that
videos were being uploaded and

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.970
so within that first week,
we quickly changed.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.080
Again the back end of the site,
we made exactly the same.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.160
It was just changing, instead of
searching for male or female in the age,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.750
you would just search for whatever
you wanted to search for in a video.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.570
And the look and
feel of it was changed a bit,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.600
but it was a very quick
two day effort to convert

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.800
what was a sort of a dating video
site into a general video site.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.800
And one of the things is,
Chad, I met Chad,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.230
the other cofounder at PayPal, the first
day I moved out here to California.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.620
He was the original designer of PayPal
and I was one of the first engineers and

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.270
we worked on a number of projects
together at PayPal, And same thing,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.340
I think one of the ideas of startups and
success of startups

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.710
is this idea of pivoting from what
you're originally starting to do and

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.700
something else instead.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.815
And PayPal, many people know what
it is now, many people use it as

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:50.758
a P2P payment service or
personal business payment service.

00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:56.159
But when it first started, it was
this palm pilot security application

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.940
that one, it never really got off
the ground as a security app.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.970
And two, these days I don't know
many people that still own,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.550
carry around palm pilots.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.410
But the valuable lesson there was just,
if you take a look at what the users

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.560
are doing, what the user feedback is,
and if people aren't using it, taking

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.840
that technology and maybe pivoting it
to something that the users will use.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.500
And we did that at PayPal when we
took the security side of it and

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.250
created a payment service on top of it,
and the same thing at YouTube.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.900
And in the beginning it was not so,

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.920
the relationship with MySpace
started with just the ability for

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.350
MySpace users to embed HTML onto
their profile pages and YouTube had

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.640
an HTML snippet that you could copy and
paste and put into your MySpace profile.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.940
After a while it became more of
a formal relationship because so

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.470
many of their users were using YouTube,
but it became almost a marriage.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.800
That if YouTube went down,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.970
so much of the content on MySpace
would not be available to view.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.800
So we started actually formalizing
that relationship when we became,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.510
we became aware that so many of
their users depended on our service.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.310
I think especially early on in
a start up in a company when you

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.247
have very limited internal resources,
right.

00:06:16.247 --> 00:06:18.437
I think some of these partnerships,

00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:22.181
especially early on when you
don't get a lot of these invites,

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:26.440
a lot of people asking you to be
a partner, you get easily excited by it.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.050
I do think that it's
valuable to not be overly

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.920
aggressive in accepting
some of these partnerships.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.385
So early on at YouTube but

00:06:34.385 --> 00:06:38.100
sort of an example of this was,
we had a lot of people asking us for

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.320
white labeling the product and
just removing YouTube off the label,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.620
removing sort of any references to
YouTube, and they just wanted us and

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.600
were willing to pay hundreds to
thousands of dollars for this.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.850
And at that time,
that meant a lot for a YouTube.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.940
But at the end of the day,
we always still hinged on

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.840
the fact that the brand name of YouTube
was very important to the product.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.750
And the earlier the company I think,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.020
the more resource starved the company,
the harder it is to make that decision.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.760
But I do think that it's very
important to actually choose

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.370
the right partnerships that actually
will help the company in the long

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.260
run rather than just something in
the next few months or next few weeks.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.230
I think that there are even a few
companies that wanted to put their own

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.470
video player on YouTube.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.380
When I was there, we didn't allow it.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.320
I think now YouTube has
accepted some of those deals.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.180
But I think it's a whole
different world by this point.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.520
And some of these guys, I mean they
just, it's like ABC or something,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.550
there's like only one unique
creator of this content,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.290
you either do it their way or
you'll never get their content.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:59.080
I think it's important to
approach the question of

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.520
any kind of partnership or
any kind of agreement is looking at it,

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.590
from their perspective what they benefit
from a deal in the making with you,

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.510
and I think in the case of
YouTube it was always the same.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.580
We didn't provide the revenue share,
really.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.870
We didn't do the sort of ads early on,

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.500
at least when we were there prior
to the acquisition by Google.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.300
So when we did these deals it was always
for marketing purposes, it was always.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:30.260
Yes, prior to the acquisition of Google,
there was still

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.780
not a lot of ads coming in, so
there was not a lot of ad revenue, so

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.850
there was not a lot of the revenue
share that you see on YouTube.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:42.558
So, what can we actually offer
the content creators out there.

00:08:42.558 --> 00:08:46.730
It was really still for, at that time,

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.220
it was really still for
short length content.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:54.280
So things are 30 seconds to two and
a half minutes.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.790
It wasn't for long length.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.530
In fact, we had a rule that no content
could be longer than 10 minutes for

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.340
the large chunk of the start of YouTube.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.110
And so it was for short-length content.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.050
It wasn't for, so

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.630
you wouldn't upload an entire 30 minute
episode of The Daily Show or something.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.460
You wouldn't upload
an entire two hour movie.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.660
One, we didn't allow it.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.750
And two, we didn't want
the platform to be seen as that.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.830
It was still for short pieces of
content that was uploaded to the site.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.270
So when it came to actually working
with these content creators,

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.530
we branded YouTube as a way to be able
to market your longer form content.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:35.600
So it was just maybe seen as a place,
a platform to show movie trailers for

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.440
your movie, but you wouldn't actually
upload the entire movie onto YouTube.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.910
I think that's gradually evolved and

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:48.100
changed over a period of time as higher
quanlity content has become possible.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.200
A bandwidth of 30 getting cheaper,
people are more accustomed to watching

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.250
this content on multiple devices now
that YouTube actually offers and

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:01.080
caters to watching the same content
on multiple devices at one time.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.967
But at the time during 2005 all the way
throughout 2007 it was always sort of

00:10:04.967 --> 00:10:07.406
short form content,
it wasn't the same quality.

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:12.065
And it was a way to be able to get more
people that would have not heard your

00:10:12.065 --> 00:10:17.034
music or would've not heard your movie
be able to use the two minute length to

00:10:17.034 --> 00:10:20.861
be able to showcase whatever
it is that you wanted to show.
