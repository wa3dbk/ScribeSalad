00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.984
For the p value for age and time you arrive at a party, you should have gotten

00:00:04.984 --> 00:00:10.680
0.2066. This is a pretty high p value. Much greater than the alpha level.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.010
Therefore we will write, we would fail to reject the null. We have no evidence

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.630
in support of the fact that our population correlation might be different from

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.940
0. For this p value, we get something small. 0.0028. And this is less than our

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.950
alpha level. So, we were right, based on our confidence interval, we decided to

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.480
reject the null. Good job.
