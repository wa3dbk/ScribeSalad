00:00:00.665 --> 00:00:02.570
All right, you're done.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.110
Let's take a look at the solution.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.130
Delete is actually pretty straightforward.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.860
Note that once again
we have almost useless parameters.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.780
S actually refers to our selection

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.760
while our strings here
are actually our selection Rs.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.290
One little trickiness in delete is that
if you actually put no selection in,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.070
it'll delete all the rows.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.040
I still want to make sure we
notify the change.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.500
I've done the slide optimization here.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.140
It would be fine
to just notify the change always,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.580
but I've decided
if no rows have been deleted,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.276
then we should bother not notifying.

00:00:35.776 --> 00:00:39.532
Unless the selection is null,
in which case we deleted all the rows,

00:00:40.152 --> 00:00:43.020
but again, it would be fine to just
use notify change here

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.040
even if no rows are actually deleted.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.580
After all, the intention was that rows
would be deleted.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.460
Once again, let's take pity on someone

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.120
who might have to maintain your code,
and change these default parameter names

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.860
to something more useful
like selection and selectionargs.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.160
Other than that,
update looks almost exactly like delete.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.300
Once again, we are returning
the number of rows

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.310
impacted by the update,
and we don't bother notifying

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.896
if no rows were impacted.

00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:16.152
Now that we've finished
writing update and delete

00:01:16.152 --> 00:01:18.390
we can go back to test provider
and add some tests.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.363
First, let's remove test delete.db,

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:23.876
the last test that doesn't depend
on the provider.

00:01:24.546 --> 00:01:26.730
Instead, let's have a test that deletes

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.300
all the records and checks to make sure
they're actually deleted.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.710
Remember, passing a null query

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.760
actually deletes
all of the records in a table.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.000
So this is really straightforward,
just passing nulls.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.040
Since we're depending
on the database for our deletes,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.430
it's not all that particularly important
that we actually test the delete functions,

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.790
although it would be nice to add that later on.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.363
The reason we'd want to add it

00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:49.916
is to make sure
that our constraints are valid.

00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:51.780
And once we're done doing the deletes,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.860
we check to make sure
that there are no rows left.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.240
Note that we have to delete weather entry
before we delete location entry

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.620
because you've got constraints
in the database that prevent weather entry

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.170
from existing if location entries
do not also exist

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.403
and would also prevent
the deletion of those entries.

00:02:06.403 --> 00:02:08.786
So let's check to see
whether that actually works.

00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:11.440
All right, that passes. Good news.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.430
Now we can add the same test
to the end to make sure

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.210
we can delete all of the rows
at the end and it still works.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.940
And as you can see, they still pass.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.550
So now we know we've deleted records
before and after running tests.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.420
Now let's try that update.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.490
We'll do just an update of the location.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.240
Again, let's start by deleting all records

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.393
and inserting a record that we want to update.

00:02:32.973 --> 00:02:34.606
One of the nice things
about content values

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:37.170
is you can actually copy them
using a copy constructor.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.900
After that, we can add the ID
we want to update

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.520
and then put the name of the city
we want to update it to.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.240
In this case, from North Pole
to Santa's Village.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.830
And then, finally, we call update.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.925
Assert that we've actually
updated exactly one record

00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:54.810
as we'd expect, and then do a query on that,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.980
validating our cursor,
making sure our update actually works.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.330
And then finally, we close our cursor.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.690
It all looks pretty good.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.400
And let's see that it actually runs,
and does the right thing.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.910
And our tests pass.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.170
So, we've now proved that we
can update, delete, insert, and query,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.250
and all this is fully tested.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.280
In other words, the bones of our application

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.850
are finished, just waiting to attach our UI.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.170
Let's go through and attach some of our UI.
