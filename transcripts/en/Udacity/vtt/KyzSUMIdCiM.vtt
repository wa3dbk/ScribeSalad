Finally, the third way in which we're able to store information is through what

00:00:04.168 --> 00:00:09.882
psychologists call an Associative Network. And this is a chain of associations

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:14.273
between related concepts. From pet, it could go to dog or cat, and from dog and

00:00:14.273 --> 00:00:18.510
cat, look at how much it branches off. This is just a quick demonstration. I

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.928
could branch this a lot further. So, from pet, we could go to dog and cat and

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:26.685
from dog and cat, we could branch off so much more. They're both fuzzy, furry,

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:31.852
four-legged animals. I had a dog named Max. My whole family loved Max. He was a

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:35.417
golden retriever. And my friend Noel loved cats. And then that makes me think

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:39.270
of college, and then my friends, and how I majored in psychology. This is a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.152
just a really short, quick example of how much this could branch off. I could

00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:46.066
double or triple this if I had time, but don't worry I won't make you guys sit

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.660
through that.
