Now this is kind of a funny question with
some funny answers, and so depending on

00:00:04.397 --> 00:00:09.203
your thinking, you might picked any of
these answers. I personally though, think

00:00:09.203 --> 00:00:14.226
that the best answer is the third one, to
count them. If the teacher counts her

00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:17.620
students before they leave and then counts
them at different points during their time

00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:21.680
at the zoo, she can know pretty easily
whether or not they are all sticking

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:27.733
together. Congratulations on completing
your first quiz of the class whether you

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:31.681
picked the same answer as I did or not.
You'll encounter many quizzes like this

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.967
throughout the rest of the course.
Although they probably won't all be as

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:38.885
silly as this one. But please remember
that even as we dig deeper into algebra,

00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:43.235
the point of all of these quizzes will be
for you to check if you understand the

00:00:43.247 --> 00:00:47.948
material. Just give each question some
thought and if you're have trouble

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.009
choosing an answer, rewatch the video or
couple of videos preceding the quiz. If

00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:58.049
you get a question right that's awesome
and if you miss one that's not a big deal

00:00:58.061 --> 00:01:03.281
at all. Just try it again and submit your
new answer. You can redo each question as

00:01:03.293 --> 00:01:08.140
many times as you need to. We want you to
do whatever you need to do to really

00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:09.898
understand the material.
