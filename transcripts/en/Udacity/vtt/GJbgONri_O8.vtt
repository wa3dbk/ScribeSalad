00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.990
Let's put together a bunch of the information we've just been talking about. To

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.890
do that, I'd like you to complete this sentence properly, or rather, these two

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.847
sentences. The graph of any function of the form f of x equals log base a of x

00:00:12.847 --> 00:00:17.336
is continuously either increasing or decreasing, on the either domain or range

00:00:17.336 --> 00:00:24.770
zero to infinity, and has either domain or range negative infinity to infinity.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.102
It has a vertical or horizontal asymptote of what and passes through which

00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:31.789
point?
