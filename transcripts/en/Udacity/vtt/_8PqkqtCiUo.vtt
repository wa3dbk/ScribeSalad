00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.880
So now we're ready for a quiz to see

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.730
if you understand the find command with the number as

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.338
the second parameter, as well as indexing and selecting

00:00:08.338 --> 00:00:12.390
sub-sequences of strings. And the question is given any string

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.090
variables, so we're going to initialize the variable s to

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.130
hold any string. T to hold any string, and i

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.880
to hold any number, which of the expressions below is

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.870
equivalent to s.find passing in t as the target string

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.521
ni as the number? So here are the

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:36.385
choices, s index i colon, find t.

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:41.710
S.find t index colon i. S i colon.find

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.540
t Plus i or s, i colon, find t,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.050
i colon. So check all the ones that are always the same as s

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.400
dot find t, i no matter what s, t, and i are. And for this

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.970
quiz, this is pretty tricky. Try to think

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.850
of the answer yourself before trying to run

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.080
anything into the Python interpreter. But feel free

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.870
to also run things in the Python interpreter

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.500
to try to confirm your answer and to see if things behave the way you expect.
