00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to ask a slight variation on this question.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This time you're given e and n and the question is is it hard to compute d.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The answers are yes, otherwise it would mean RSA is insecure

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
or no we can just compute the totient of n on the multiplicative inverse using

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
