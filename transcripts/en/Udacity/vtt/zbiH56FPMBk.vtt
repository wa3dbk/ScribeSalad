00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.590
You've just worked with the question class and now its time to form a Subclass.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.370
We've all seen these multiple choice questions, as a question and there're

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.044
multiple choices hence the name. By the way, if you ever want to know what's

00:00:14.044 --> 00:00:17.702
the original name of the Java language, it was Oak, which was a name that was

00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:23.308
so dull and boring that they changed it. Now, of course, one could put this

00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:28.180
entire text here into a question class and set the answer to this string three.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.962
But that too would be dull and boring. It would be better to have a class that

00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:36.245
specifically deals with multiple-choice questions. So that we could declare an

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:41.020
object, somewhat like this. We make a Choice Question, that's what I'm calling

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.604
this class. We still need to set the text of course, but then for the choices I

00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:47.628
want to be able to call a method that I call addChoice that adds the particular

00:00:47.628 --> 00:00:52.600
choice and then specifies whether it's false or true. When I formed the Choice

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.360
Question class, I didn't want to start from scratch. I want to inherit as much

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.409
as possible from the question class that's already written. Let's see how to do

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.090
that. I'll define the ChoiceQuestion class and then I specify that it extends

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.314
the question class, that's the Java keyword for denoting that ChoiseQuestion

00:01:10.314 --> 00:01:15.821
should become a subclass of question. Into the body of the subclass, I put in

00:01:15.821 --> 00:01:20.634
any new methods that are present in the subclass but not the super class. Such

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:24.320
as the Add Choice Method. You also put in the implementations of any methods

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.247
that needed to change in the sub class. For example, we'll need to change the

00:01:28.247 --> 00:01:31.161
display method, since displaying a choice question must also display the

00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:35.648
choices. And finally, you of course need to add any instance variables that the

00:01:35.648 --> 00:01:40.648
choice question class needs to do its job. In our case, that would be the list

00:01:40.648 --> 00:01:45.912
of the choices. The key point is what you don't put in here. When you define a

00:01:45.912 --> 00:01:48.984
subclass, you never include any of the methods from the superclass that work

00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:53.466
just fine. For example, the set text method will work fine, and we can simply

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:57.486
inherit it from the superclass. Also, you don't want to include any fields from

00:01:57.486 --> 00:02:00.910
the superclass. You get those automatically, and if you were to include them

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.725
again, you'd get 'em twice, which is not good. The point is that, what you put

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:09.905
inside here is the difference from the superclass. Everything that the subclass

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:12.772
has, that the superclass doesn't have at all or that it doesn't have in the

00:02:12.772 --> 00:02:17.280
same way. Let's have a closer look at exactly how that works for question and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.993
choice question. Here is our question class, here is the choice question class.

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:28.088
Now have a close look and tell me, which methods does the choice question class

00:02:28.088 --> 00:02:32.858
inherit? Just give me the names of all those methods that choice question

00:02:32.858 --> 00:02:38.179
doesn't redefine, that it simply picks up from question. Which methods does

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:42.543
choice question overrides? That is which method does choice question need to

00:02:42.543 --> 00:02:47.668
redefine because the one's from question are not satisfactory. And finally,

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:51.380
which method or methods does choice question add that weren't present in the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.976
question class in the first place? Just give me the names of the methods, all

00:02:56.976 --> 00:03:00.024
together there are 5 of them.
