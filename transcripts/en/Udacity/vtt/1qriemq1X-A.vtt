00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.969
So now typically the world constructor actually takes a vector which represents

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.164
the gravity in the word. Now since we're a top down game we don't really have a

00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:12.449
2D gravity vector so we leave this at 0 0 for now. Now the second variable is a

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.614
little tricky. This is a boolean value which tells Box2D whether or not an

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:18.686
object is allowed to sleep in the world given some threshold of tolerance for

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:23.066
their computation. For our purposes we don't want to let objects sleep, so set

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.220
this to false.
