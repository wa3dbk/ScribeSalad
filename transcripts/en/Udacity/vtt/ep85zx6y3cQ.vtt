00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So we've just had a chance to learn a bit about debugging,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which is made up of testing and then trying to localize or isolate the fault

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and then fixing it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I actually had a chance to work at a lovely company in Santa Barbara,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Green Hills Software, where my job was to do just that

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
for just the sort of interpreter that you're writing.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Every day I'd come in and there would be a stack of input programs on my desk,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and our interpreter--or our compiler--was currently computing

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the wrong answers for them.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I would do this sort of hypothesis testing that we've been considering here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'd say, oh; what if the bug is in the top half of the program?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Then I can comment out the bottom half, and I should still see the bug.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Oh, that didn't work.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Maybe I'll hypothesize now that the bug is in the bottom half of the program.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'll comment out the top half and we'll still see the bug.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I could refine my way down--maybe it's in the top fourth,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
maybe it's in the top eighth, until eventually I had a very small input

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that still showed the bug.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And then it was easy for me to localize the fault and fix it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The process was relatively lockstep, so lockstep in fact that a few years ago

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
a researcher, Andreas Zeller, published a technique for automating it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
His approach, called Delta Debugging, makes it systematic--

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
does this systematic hypothesis testing by dividing a program input

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
in half and half again until it finds the smallest input that still reproduces the bug.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
In fact, looking back on it now, the job that I had is almost completely automated.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
When you run into defects or bugs in your code, and you probably will--

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I certainly do all the time--I want you to apply that same level of formal reasoning.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Think about where the bug might be.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Make a test case that probes or falsifies that hypothesis.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Localize the defect.

00:01:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And then move in to fix it.
