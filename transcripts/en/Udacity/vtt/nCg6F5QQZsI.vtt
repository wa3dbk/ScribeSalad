00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:08.290
The lower limit is 105.36. The upper limit is 146.64. Remember, we got that by

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.610
taking our sample mean, X bar, and adding and subtracting the margin of error.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:21.435
In this case, 126 plus, minus 20.64. What this means is that if the co-op

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:25.790
implemented this cost saving program for all of it's members, they would likely

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.824
pay on average between $105.36 and $146.64. If we want to round that to whole

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:38.870
dollars. It's just to make things easier. We would say that they would spend on

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.610
average between $105 and $147. That's our confidence interval.
