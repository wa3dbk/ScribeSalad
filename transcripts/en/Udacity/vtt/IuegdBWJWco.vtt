00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.299
Here's a quote from Tony Wasserman about detail design.

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:08.357
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:08.357 --> 00:00:12.894
The primary activity during detail design, is designing the data structures that

00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:16.457
are there and by implication the algorithms that are going to work on

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:20.880
those data structures. As far as those algorithms are concerned,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.620
sometimes you may wish to represent them using some kind of design notation.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.810
Here are a few that have been used in the past in which you may have little

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.260
familiarity. Their pseudo code, which is like writing a programming language

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.910
algorithm without the programming language. There's structured programming,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.950
which is a set of control structures,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.470
which allow you to organize the algorithm into sequences,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.670
conditions, repetition, and chunking in the form of calling subprocedures.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.190
Flow charts and call graphs are graphic representations of programs,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.760
that may be useful in helping you understand how that program is going to,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.140
going to work. And in some cases decision tables, which are lists of rules and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.390
the conditions under which those rules are going to apply,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.170
can be useful in helping to understand complex situations.
