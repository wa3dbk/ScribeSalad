00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.150
In general, too much patient care
in the U.S. is provided this way.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.882
In part, as we just discussed,
this is because of patient choice.

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:15.183
But, if all patients wanted a PCP, we
don't have enough of them to go around.

00:00:15.183 --> 00:00:19.759
Only 12.3% of US patients practice

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:25.020
primary care versus
around 50% in France.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.540
The same comparison holds true with
other advanced industrialized nations.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.790
You can see here, the U.S.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.550
lags substantially in the percentage
of primary care physicians.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.443
The full reasons are beyond
the scope of this course.

00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:44.884
But one of them is that specialist,
shown in green here,

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:48.318
makes significantly
more money than PCPs.

00:00:48.318 --> 00:00:51.469
Yet, as also shown here in blue,

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.240
they leave medical school
with the same debt level.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.110
So it shouldn't be a surprise,
as shown here, that over the years

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.200
the percentage of medical school
graduates selecting primary care,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.510
the bottom blue line here,
has decreased, as the salary of a PCP,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.960
as a percentage of what a specialist
makes, has also declined.
