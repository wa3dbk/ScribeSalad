00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.921
Try solving these two number puzzles. You want two factors that multiply to give

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:09.583
you the top number, like 4 times 5 equals 20, and the two numbers need to add to

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:14.339
the bottom number, 4 plus 5 equals 9. And it doesn't matter which order you put

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.502
the numbers in. I could have also written five here and four here. You'll be

00:00:18.502 --> 00:00:19.739
correct either way.
