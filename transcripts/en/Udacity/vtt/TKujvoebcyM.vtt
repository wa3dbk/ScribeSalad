00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.298
So, what we learned from the last quiz is
that, when you have a negative exponent,

00:00:04.298 --> 00:00:07.753
you can rewrite whatever term you're
dealing with, so that we're instead,

00:00:07.753 --> 00:00:12.426
dividing by that factor inside the term.
So, negative exponents are actually veiled

00:00:12.426 --> 00:00:17.435
ways of writing division into our term.
The way we know what we're dividing by, is

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:21.490
to find the factor with a negative
exponent, which is just y^-2, in this

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:25.870
case. And we move it underneath the
factors of the positive exponents to make

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:29.899
it the denominator of the term. So, on the
right side of the equation where we've

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.725
moved it, it's now in the denominator. And
we've also changed the power of the base

00:00:34.737 --> 00:00:39.290
to be positive instead of negative. So, we
flip the sign of an exponent from negative

00:00:39.302 --> 00:00:43.615
to positive or from positive to negative.
We need to move the factor or the base

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:48.600
number that the exponent is applied to, to
the opposite side of the fraction. If it's

00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:52.021
in the top, it needs to move to the bottom
and if it's in the bottom, it needs to

00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:57.192
move to the top, and we also flip the sign
of the exponent. So here, we change from

00:00:57.192 --> 00:01:01.476
negative to positive. So basically, if we
have some number, let's call it x and it's

00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:07.115
taken to a negative power, let's say,
that's -a, where a could be any number, or

00:01:07.127 --> 00:01:11.409
really any expression. Then, this is equal
to 1/x^a.

00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:16.988
So again, we multiply the exponent of a
number by -1. We need to switch which part

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:22.098
of the fraction the factor it belongs to
is part of. I know that what's on the left

00:01:22.098 --> 00:01:27.214
side here doesn't look like a fraction,
but this is actually secretly x^-a/1.

00:01:27.214 --> 00:01:30.716
So, anything that doesn't look like it's
part of a fraction is actually in the

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:33.541
numerator of your fraction, where the
denominator is 1.
