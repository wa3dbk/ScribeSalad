00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.333
The last issue is what's called drift,
okay.

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:08.750
Drift is the error that happens
that accumulates over time.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.419
That basically what happens is you've
got this dynamic model that's making

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.875
a prediction and, and you've got
its censored observation model etc.

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:20.160
And you're really caught
with two choices, okay, and

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.542
both of the choices are lousy.

00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:28.260
Choice one is,
I stick to my target model, right?

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.830
I really believe the model.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.230
And I never change it, like its
appearance, it's colored up just.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.040
The problem with that is what
happens if the object is changing?

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.470
All of a sudden, you know,
it goes in the trees, shadows,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.960
things look a little different,
and I didn't update my model.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.560
So, almost every tracker does
some form of model update.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.428
The problem with that is
when you do model update,

00:00:48.428 --> 00:00:50.833
you run into situation like this, okay?

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:53.488
So this is actually taken from
the Tracking People paper,

00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:56.790
although this was, they were
explaining how not to do tracking.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.180
So they've got this little box that's
stuck on the middle of the ice skater.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.542
And each time they're updating
something about the description, and

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:07.583
eventually the box slides down.

00:01:07.583 --> 00:01:10.081
And what's not shown here is,

00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:16.700
it might get stuck on the background
markings in the, in the rink.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.770
And so what's happening is you keep
changing, changing, changing and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.227
all of the sudden more of the mark,

00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:24.020
of the target model came from
the rink than came from the skaters.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.590
So as the skater leaves,
the model stays right there.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.800
And this is the,
the problem with adaptive tracking.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.720
And so all real tracking,
in order to fight drift,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.220
always has this balance between how
quickly or how much do I change

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.700
my model versus how much do I
keep what I had from before.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.160
And you might ask, well,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.900
how come I didn't see any of this in
all that Bayesian stuff that you did?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.430
The reason is, I gave you
the sensor model, P of z given x.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.050
And I really didn't tell you
how it behaves generically, or

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.980
I should say, all the time.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.620
It just, we, we in fact, all we did
was we generically gave the algorithm.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.480
P of z given x might be how
well do I match the pixels.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.560
Well, but if the pixels are changing,
I have to change my sensor model.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.380
So that's the place in the algorithm
where that notion of how well do I

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.400
hold onto my old model versus change it.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.840
That's the place where it stays.
