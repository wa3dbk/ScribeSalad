For this quiz,
I'm going to show you two websites.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.939
And I want you, to tell me,
how many break points each website has.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.590
First off, there's medium.com.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.300
Pay attention to this example.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.560
I'll start small, and
then slowly resize the page.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.180
Watch the way the content changes.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.270
Okay?

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.300
And this is the sample site
I want you to check out.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.270
Notice how this content changes,
when I resize the browser.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.670
You can find a link to this page,
