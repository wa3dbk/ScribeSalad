00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.120
Since the slope in this case will be the change in tax

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.360
paid, over the change in income earned, that will give us the tax

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.590
rate written as a decimal. If we wanted to see the tax rate

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.421
written as a percent instead, we need to multiply the decimal by 100.
