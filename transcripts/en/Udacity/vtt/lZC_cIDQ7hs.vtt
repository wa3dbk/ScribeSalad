00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.290
Now that we have some groovy under our
belts, we're in a much better position

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.880
to understand what's going on
inside of Gradle build script.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:08.900
Just like a closure can
have a delegate object,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.870
the entire build script
delegates to a project object.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.700
All the keywords in the Gradle DSL
are properties of, or

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.530
methods on the project object.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.320
For instance, the project object has a
method called task for declaring tasks.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.370
It accepts the name of a new task and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.670
optionally a configuration closure
which we'll talk about shortly.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.250
If we run Gradle tasks to have a look at
all the tasks that are currently defined

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.730
we see under other tasks my
task one that we just defined.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.680
All right.
Everything's working so far.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.370
Because the entire build script
delegates to the project object,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.680
we can actually go ahead and leave
that off when we're declaring tasks.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.560
Also, because Groovy Syntax is awesome,
we can knock of those parentheses as

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.610
well, since this is just
calling a function.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.570
Now this next part is tricky.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.571
Gradle actually reaches into
Groovy's execution model.

00:00:58.571 --> 00:01:01.147
And uses an advanced Groovy feature
called an abstract syntax tree

00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:01.885
transformation.

00:01:01.885 --> 00:01:04.959
The upshot of which is,
you can knock off the quotes as well.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.200
This is not a thing you need
to understand super deeply,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.000
however we do have more information in
the demo code provided with the class.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.050
Now that we have declared a task, we can
also configure some properties on it.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.160
So, we can give myTask4 a description,
and we can give it a group.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.830
If we then run Gradle tasks again,
this is what we see.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.770
Here's the group up here,
and here's the description.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.290
The most important property
of a task is the list of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.460
actions the task will perform.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.720
Instead of setting the actions property
directly, we add a closure to the end of

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.140
list of actions to perform
using the do last method.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.430
So, let's give task four a try.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.570
Gradle helpfully tells us that it ran
myTask4, and that it went ahead and

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.110
printed the statement.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.190
There's a few other ways to add
closures to that list of actions for

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.880
the task to perform.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.740
We can add doFirst to add a task
on to the front of a list.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.260
We can also use the left shift operator
which does exactly the same thing as

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.220
doLast.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.110
This is nice because it allows us
to use this very compact syntax,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.750
and this is what you'll see most
often when people are declaring,

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.780
very simple tasks in Gradle.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.449
We can also declare a task, and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.310
then immediately pass it a closure
to execute as its action.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.974
This is an extremely common pattern,

00:02:12.974 --> 00:02:15.919
and it's probably the most common way
that people declare simple Gradle tasks.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.760
Instead of configuring a task line
by line as we were doing previously,

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.980
we can also pass a configuration
closure when we're defining a task.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.310
The configuration closure
delegates to the task object.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.690
So it can go ahead and
set the description, the group, and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.560
the actions of the task.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.590
Now you may have noticed something
a little bit weird about that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.190
configuration block.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.700
We are trying to assign
this string description,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.690
but there's no equal sign here.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.180
Well Gradle's actually done
something very clever.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.950
For every property, it's created
a setter with the exact same name.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.620
So this line is actually a function call
omitting the parentheses because Groovy.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.670
Assignment also works just as well.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.170
There's only one gotcha with this.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.950
And that is, if you're assigning
a collection to a property in

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.730
a configuration closure,
you gotta use the equals sign.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.100
Just a thing to keep in mind.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.850
One more thing to know about tasks,

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.330
some task properties can be set in
the task declaration like this.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.960
However, not all properties
can be set this way, so

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.620
check out the course code for
the full story.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.500
The only time you actually have to use
this syntax is when you're declaring

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.270
a typed task,
which we'll talk about soon.
