00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.340
I mentioned before that we rationalize the denominator so we can make a better

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.508
approximation for our answer. We can use the square root of 10 divided by 5 to

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:11.988
help us approximate the answer for this expression. I don't know what it really

00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:16.892
means to divide by root 5. But I can approximate this by dividing by 5. We know

00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:19.960
the square root of 9 equals 3, so the square root of 10 is just a little bit

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.913
more than 3. We're going to approximate it though and just use 3. So root 10

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:31.172
divided by 5 is about 3 5th or 6 10th. If we would had left this expression as

00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:35.570
it was, we would have had to divide by a non-terminating decimal. Dividing by

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.198
the square root of 5 is much more challenging than doing this approximation. As

00:00:40.198 --> 00:00:43.762
we work through this unit, we'll be taking denominators that contain radicals

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:47.560
and changing them into integers or other expressions that don't contain

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.320
radicals. For square roots, this is pretty simple. We can just multiply the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.900
numerator and denominator. By the exact radical that appears in the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.850
denominator. Then we just multiply our radicals together and simplify if

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.393
possible.
