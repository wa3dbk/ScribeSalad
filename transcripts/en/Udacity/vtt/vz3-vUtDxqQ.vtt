00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.616
Now let's use some numbers and variables. It turns out that after one month of

00:00:04.628 --> 00:00:09.436
just producing wipers, Grant had spent $5,685. I'd like you to think about the

00:00:09.448 --> 00:00:14.281
last equation that we came up with in the previous quiz, and write a new version

00:00:14.293 --> 00:00:19.058
of it, including all this information. I'd also like you to call the number of

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.597
wiper sets made in a month, x. Please write your new equation for the situation

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.823
in this box. And leave out any dollar signs that you might want to include for

00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:28.025
now.
