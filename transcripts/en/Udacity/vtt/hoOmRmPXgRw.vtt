00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.070
The most common thing that you do in the
rules, besides checking if the user is

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.960
the owner of the list, is to check
whether the user is shared on the list.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.430
A prime example of this is the read
rule for the shoppingListitems.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.290
So using the sharedWith table,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.730
can you check if the current user
is shared on the shopping list?

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.990
So if you're talking about a shopping
list and you go over to userLists, and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.480
you look at the details of shopping
list, you can see the owner's here.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.263
But because we've de-normalized some
stuff, there are kind of parts of

00:00:28.263 --> 00:00:32.130
a shopping list which are located
to different parts of the database.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.190
One example being shoppingListitems,
and also sharedWith.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.070
Both of these are associated
with a single shopping list.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.875
So let's say we are looking at the items
for this shopping list, shopping list

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:48.210
K7J-8k, and remember that shopping list
owner is [INAUDIBLE] as shown here.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.270
If I'm over here in shoppingListitems,
I could drill down and

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.990
I don't really see who the owner
of the shopping list is.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.980
That's not stored here.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.200
The owner of each of the items is stored
here but, not the owner of the entire

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.860
shopping list,
which is important for some checks.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.835
And this leads to kind of long and
difficult to read rules for

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.770
shoppingListitems when I
want to say something like

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.290
the owner the shopping
list can read these items.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.320
So can you think of a better solution
for getting the order of a shopping list

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.520
and using it in the rules for
a shoppingListitems and sharedWith?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.470
Maybe you could draw some inspiration
from the UND mapping note that

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.470
you just created.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.210
I'll go ahead and
send a respect right now.
