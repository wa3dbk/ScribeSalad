00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.860
One piece of functionality that's still missing from our

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.810
Conference Central app is that so far there's no way

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.050
for users to register to attend a conference. Although

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.320
we see the register button in the UI, it doesn't

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.530
do any good to click it because we haven't

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.480
implemented the function that it calls. You're going to be

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.270
adding that feature next. The process of registering for a

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.140
conference involves several separate tasks,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.710
including updating the users profile.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.130
To know which conferences they have registered to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.500
attend, as well as decreasing the number of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.170
seats available for the conference. Also, what happens

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.190
if there's only one seat left for the conference

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.920
and several people try to register for it at the same time? Who gets it? How

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.870
do we handle those potential conflicts? We're going

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.740
to use transactions to ensure that all relevant entities

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.260
get updated, or none of them do, and to make

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.980
sure that only person can get the very last seat at

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.280
a conference. We're going to use a property called conferences

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.930
to attend to keep track of which conferences a user will

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.140
attend, and this property is going to be on the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.990
profile entity. So in the profile class you'll need to add

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.940
some things. You'll add the conference keys to attend field. This

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.060
property contains the list of the keys for all the conferences

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.350
that the user has registered to attend, and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.220
note that it's a list of strings. You're also

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.490
going to need. Most likely to fix the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.710
import. You'll also need to define the get a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.900
method for this property to return a copy

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.280
of the list, and rather than a regular get

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.980
a method. What you'll need instead is a

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.150
method that takes conference key and adds it to

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.990
the existing list. So we're going to call that, add

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.310
to conference key to attend, and this how you'll

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.560
define it. You'll add the new conference key to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.240
the existing values. You'll also need to add a

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.520
method to remove a value from conference keys to

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.530
attend, in case the user decides to unregister from

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.760
a conference. So basically the unregister from conference method

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.220
simply removes the conference key from the existing values but

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.850
it needs to check first that the conference key

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.900
is already in the property and if not, throw

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.330
an invalid conference key exception. I mean, basically you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.780
can't unregister from a conference that you haven't actually registered

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.590
for, and in the conference api class, you're going

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.120
to need to write the method. Register for conference. You

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.530
can start out by copying the skeletal code for

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.600
register for conference from the lesson four folder and copy

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.400
it into the conference API class. Here it is,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.820
register for conference. We want this method to return true

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.790
or false to indicate whether the registration was successful

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.020
or not. The endpoint functions must return objects. They can't

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.520
return simple data type objects such as string or

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.020
long or Boolean. These are classical wrapped Boolean instead of

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.820
Boolean as a return type of the method. So

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.560
the file that contains a skeleton for register for conference

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.750
also contains a full-length commentation of the wrapped Boolean

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.500
class. So here's a wrapped Boolean class, it basically

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.190
has a couple of fields: results, and reason, and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.530
the result is going to be the true or false, and

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.990
the reason is going to be the reason for the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.400
result, and typically, you'll set the reason if the result

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.000
is false. We just have a constructor that takes

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.850
result and the reason. We have a constructor that just

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.880
takes a result and then we have getters for the result

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.520
and the reason. That same file also includes the definition for

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.130
the function get conference which returns a conference give a string

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.860
of its key. This method is used by the UI for

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.120
the app to get the details to show on the page

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.950
where you can register for a conference. You won't be using

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.420
it in your transaction, but you'll need to have it if

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.540
you want to use the UI to register for a conference,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.490
and you're going to need to fix a couple of the imports. The named class comes

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.960
from javax.inject and the not found exception comes from

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.670
the server.spi.response package. So let's import

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.580
that, and you get conferences provided fully

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.940
implemented for you, you should be able to

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.620
understand the code that it implements. So

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.620
back to the code for register for conference.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.170
We need to import a couple more exceptions,

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.730
and they're all in SPRM response. So you're going

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.690
to be implementing this code. So what you're

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.540
going to do is obviously check if the user

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.970
is null, and if it is, throw an

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.390
unauthorized exception. Exception, then you're going to start a transaction

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.700
and then you're going to write the code to get

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.770
the conference key, get the conference entity and if

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.210
there's no conference with the given conference ID, you're going to,

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.790
instead of just throwing an exception, you're going to create a

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.210
new wrapped Boolean. That's false and your going to need

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.370
to set the reason to explain why it's false, and your

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.190
going to get the user's profile. Your going to check

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.230
if the user already registered to attend this conference and if

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.580
they did, your going to need to create a new

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.900
rappedBoolean. Set it to false, and explain why. You're also going

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.570
to need to take account of whether is any seats left

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.770
and if not you're again going to have to create new WrappedBoolean

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.240
and explain that there is no seats left. Then if all

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.710
the conditions are met and if it's okay for the user to

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.330
register for the conference, go ahead and do the registration. So

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.250
you need to add the conference key to the user's conference keys

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.700
to tend property. You need to decrease the number of seats

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.110
available. You need to save the conference and the profile entities and

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.770
then you need to return a WrappedBoolean whose value

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.530
is true because this transaction requires a WrappedBoolean result

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.630
and then if there were reasons why it didn't

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.200
succeed, you're going to need to turn around and throw

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.420
the appropriate exceptions, and then finally return the result.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.350
So one more thing to mention is that when

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.290
you do go ahead and book the seats, the

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.140
conference class already has a method book seats that just

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.650
decreases the number of seats available

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.870
in the conference. It's already implemented

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.040
in the conference class. So you can go ahead and look at that.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.680
So all this code takes place inside of a transaction. So you're going to

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.840
need to know how to write the code for a transaction in Objectify.
