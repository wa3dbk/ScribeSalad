Hey, awesome job.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.300
And now we can actually see
the translation of the words in our app.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.230
So let's take a step back for a moment,
and reflect on all that we've learned.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.520
So first, we covered how to use arrays.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.810
And then we switched over to
using lists, remember lists?

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.079
They were great.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.480
And then we learned about loops.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.010
Then we had to learn about view
recycling, using the list view and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.200
the ArrayAdapter.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.730
But we ran into some limitations
with the ArrayAdapter, so

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.680
we created a custom ArrayAdapter to
display specifically word objects.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.520
Now each of these skills can be used for
apps beyond your MeWalk app.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.630
And I encourage you to take time and

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.300
reflect on how you can use these
skills in your future projects.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.980
Now I'd like you to sit back and
reflect on different places you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.900
can apply the skills that
you've learned in this lesson.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.300
So we covered topics such as arrays,
lists, loops,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.150
view recycling, ListView and
ArrayAdapters, and custom ArrayAdapters.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.810
So boy, there are a lot of topics.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.210
And after you reflected on it,
go ahead and

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.490
share your thoughts on
the discussion forms.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.985
And check out what other
students have said, too.
