00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.310
On the QuantDesk platform,
we can backtest in exactly the same way.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.790
Go over here to the BackTest tab and
click on Forecast.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.770
And again, we can configure which group
of stocks are we going to work with,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.770
and what are the settings for
our backtest.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.160
For instance,
how much money do we start with?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.710
How frequently do we want to trade,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.960
over what period of time do we want
to run the backtest and so on.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.619
Anyway, we make those selections.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.700
We also need to choose parameters for
the forecaster.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.250
Again, which model do we want to use,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.320
which includes what are the factors
that we're paying attention to.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.620
How far into the future do we
want to make our forecast and

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.100
how much data looking
back do we want to use.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.670
Once we make all those selections,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.680
we can click on BackTest and
it'll start running.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.990
It takes quite a bit of time,
so we're going to go ahead and

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.070
process in the background.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.870
And I'll show you what one of
these backtests looks like.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.510
Here's an example report
their system generates.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.230
This is again for a forecast backtest.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.680
The orange line here represents
the historical value of our portfolio.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.980
The blue is the benchmark that
we're using, which is S&amp;P 500.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.440
You can see here a number
of metrics tabulated

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.500
over this period of time
we saw 346% return.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.069
Our sharp ratio was 1.14 and so on.

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.286
So this is just an example of the kinds
of systems you can build using

00:01:38.286 --> 00:01:41.660
the sorts of things we
teach you in this class.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.570
So that's the forecast backtest.
