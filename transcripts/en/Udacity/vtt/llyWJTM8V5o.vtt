00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.210
So, the first thing you probably did was note that there's 1% here, and 1%

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:12.167
here, so that the total area under the normal curve adds to 100%. So, now let's

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:16.920
bring up the Z table. So we're looking for a proportion of 0.01 that's under

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:25.043
the curve to the left of the Z score. Our closest bet is right here, .0099. So,

00:00:25.043 --> 00:00:31.272
that's the closest value in the Z table to .01 or 1%. And that corresponds to z

00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:37.463
square of negative 2.33. So, this z squared value is going to be negative 2.33

00:00:37.463 --> 00:00:45.749
and you should have written here positive 2.33. So, 98% of sample means fall

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:52.960
within positive 2.33 standard errors from the population mean.
