00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.460
Now that we've got a sense of our
critical questions and that they've

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.170
all been answered, we need to consider
how many times they've been answered.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.840
How many users do we need to test with
to feel confident in our results?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.410
Luckily for

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.240
us, it turns out that we really only
need a few people to get good data.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.390
Each prototype should be
shown to three to five users,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.440
in order to catch most of
the issues in the design.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.010
One of the most fascinating articles
in user research by Jakob Nielsen,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.119
shows that on average a study of 3 users
will find upwards of 60% of the issues

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.950
with your prototype.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.490
A study of 5 users will average
upwards of 75% of the issues.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.040
In either case, that's enough to get
a sense of how the prototype did, and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.370
further research gives
vastly diminishing returns.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.080
The art of prototyping is
not the art of extensive QA.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.630
It is a waste of time to find 100% of

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.460
the issues in an app design
that you plan on throwing out.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.900
When you have three to five users
being asked the same questions,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.770
you start to see trends.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.260
User B will probably find some
of the same flaws as user A, and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.370
these flaws should be
counted as more glaring.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.580
When you're thinking about how to
weigh data from various users,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.980
it's useful to go back to how
critical the question was.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.110
If a critical part of
the app is going wrong for

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.810
multiple users, you have a problem.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.930
When you're thinking about how to
weigh data from various users,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.240
it's useful to go back to
how critical a question was.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450
If a critical part of
the app is going wrong for

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.400
multiple users, you have a problem.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.710
If a less critical part of the app
is going wrong for multiple users,

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.590
you're probably still fine and can iron
that out in meeting fidelity prototypes.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.140
So, for our app, we'll want to bucket
feedback from all of our users.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.630
In to some style of yes or
no by question.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.930
That will allow us to actually make
a decision about our app moving forward.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.820
You'll note that we've only done
research with two users for our study.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.450
That's because when we
include your user testing,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.710
we'll have a full study of three users.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.030
In the next node, we'll decide whether
to make another Lo-Fi prototype, or

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.210
whether to move on to
a medium fidelity one.
