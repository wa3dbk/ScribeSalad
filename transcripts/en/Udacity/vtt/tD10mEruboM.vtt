00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.898
The smaller number is negative 3, and the larger number is positive 4. Nice

00:00:04.898 --> 00:00:08.470
work, if you found these two answers. To find these two answers, we simply

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.480
want to factor this side of the equation, and then set each factor equal to 0.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.064
When we factor here, we want to find factors of negative 12 that sum to

00:00:17.064 --> 00:00:22.368
negative 1. Those factors are negative 4 and positive 3. Next, we set each

00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:25.940
factor equal to 0, and then solve for our two values of x.
