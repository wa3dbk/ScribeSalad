00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.832
Here we're practicing the pattern for collecting values in a class. Here's is

00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:09.888
already the instance variable that does the collecting. Before we forget, let's

00:00:09.888 --> 00:00:15.624
make sure it's initialize in the constructor, here we go. By the way, I did

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:19.581
forget that when I prepared the solution. Let's see here, here we need to add a

00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:26.080
strain to the collection, here's the code for that. Now sometimes, the code

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.524
really is as simple as this. It's still necessary to have a separate method

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:34.748
because of course passengers is a private instance variable that the public

00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:40.309
can't use. In our example, the add passenger method is a bit more complex

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.680
because we should only add when there's space. Last time around we had a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.146
counter for the number of passengers. We don't have that this time, but we have

00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:56.104
a method, down here. So I'll just call that method. And again if there's room,

00:00:56.104 --> 00:00:59.770
then I'll do the adding. I don't expect that we actually have to implement that

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.233
method, that's simply the size of the collection. The last method here, gives

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:09.377
us more information about the contents of our collection. Unfortunately it's

00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:14.184
already been implemented. It simply returns the array list converted to a

00:01:14.184 --> 00:01:20.723
string, which, has this characteristic form. All of the strings inside,

00:01:20.723 --> 00:01:25.906
surrounded by brackets. So that's the general collection pattern, any time that

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:31.030
an object wants to collect other objects. Using the array list or an array such

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.638
as this one, and did I mentioned, that you should never forget initialize the

00:01:35.638 --> 00:01:41.715
array list or array in the construction. You will get to practice these

00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:45.740
patterns with another example that's dear to Sarah's heart.
