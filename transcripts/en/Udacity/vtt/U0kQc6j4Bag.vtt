00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.360
Our mapper code creates variables that
we will use to create columns within

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.150
our database.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.610
When we create a column, we must also
pass an attribute to that column.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.420
Here are some column attributes that
we will be using in the activities in

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.470
lesson one.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.920
We can specify a string, with
a specified maximum string length and

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.430
we can specify integers which are handy
for storing whole number values.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.340
Relationships tell SQLAlchemy
the type of relationship one

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.870
table has to another.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.850
Nullable is an attribute that
if set to false indicates that

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.400
a column entry must have a value in
order for the row to be created.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.409
Setting primary key to true
indicates a value that we can use to

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.340
uniquely identify each row
of our database table.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.780
And foreign key we can use to reference
a row in a different table provided that

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.810
a relation exists
between the two of them.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.390
Inside each restaurant class, for now
we're just going to specify a name and

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.240
an ID number to reference
each restaurant.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.330
We create a variable and
name it name, specify it as a column,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.400
say that this column has a string with
a maximum length of 80 characters, and

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.050
set nullable equal to false.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.770
Indicating that if name is not
filled out we can not create a new

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.790
restaurant row in this database.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.360
Similarly, we'll create
a variable called id,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.080
which we'll also specify as a column.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.990
But this time we'll say it's
an integer instead of a string, and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.710
set primary key to true.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.040
Our menu items are going to have
a little bit more information.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.930
Just like each restaurant,
each menu item needs to have a name.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.830
We'll set nullable equal to false again,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.910
to make sure that no one can
create a menu item without a name.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.630
We'll create an id for each menu item
which is set to the primary key.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.470
We'll create course, description and

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.480
price variables and
specify them all as strings.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.580
I'm now going to create a variable
called restaurant_ID and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.830
specify this as a foreign key integer.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.580
This will create the foreign key
relationship between my menu item

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.410
class and my restaurant class.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.820
Inside the foreign key I
specify restaurant.id.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.280
This will say look inside
the restaurant table and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.300
retrieve the ID number whenever
I ask for restaurant_id.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.570
In this last line I'm creating
a variable called lowercase restaurant

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.530
which I'm saying is the relationship
between my class restaurant.
