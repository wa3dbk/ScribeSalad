00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.021
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The first sign point up and to the right so this must have positive flow. We

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:08.117
also know if someone is walking on it, that they would be walking uphill, so we

00:00:08.117 --> 00:00:12.225
have positive slope. This line is vertical we can't walk up it, so the slope is

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:16.036
undefined. This third line points down and to the right, so it must have

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:20.274
negative slope. Here our line points down and to the right so its also negative

00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:25.302
slope. This one would be positive. And this last one would be 0. We have a

00:00:25.302 --> 00:00:28.925
horizontal line, so lots of run and no rise.
