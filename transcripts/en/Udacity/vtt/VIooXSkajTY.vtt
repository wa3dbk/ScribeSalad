00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.925
We want the value of x when y equals 850, since remeber y in this situation

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:10.000
stands for the total cost to Grant. And x stands for the number of gallons of

00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:15.175
cleaning fluid he'll get. If we follow the line y equals 850, over to where it

00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:20.525
intersects other lines, we'll be finding the points on those lines that have a y

00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:25.679
coordinate of 850. From there, we can find the x-coordinate that goes along with

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:28.294
those points, and we'll have our solution.
