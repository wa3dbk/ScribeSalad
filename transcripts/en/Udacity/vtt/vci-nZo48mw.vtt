00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To see if it's a tree, the first thing we need to do is to see if the graph is connected.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Looking through the 8 graphs, you can see that the fourth graph is not connected.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Recoloring the edges, we can see that these three nodes are not connected to these three nodes.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, this one can't be a tree. All the other graphs are connected.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The next thing we need to look for are cycles.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The second graph is a ring, and it's obviously a cycle.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In the seventh graph, there's a cycle between these four nodes connected by the edges in pink.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, that can't be a tree. That leaves these other fives graphs, all of which are trees.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, some of these--like this one--it's kind of obvious that it looks like a tree.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But the eighth graph doesn't really look like a tree. Why do we call it a tree graph?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What we can do is number and rearrange the nodes to make it look like a tree.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
There are seven nodes in this graph, and I've numbered them 0 through 6.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's start rearranging this. Let's start with node 6.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, node 6 is connected to node 2, so we'll draw that connection.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Node 6 is also connected to node 1, so there's that edge.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We can see that node 2 is connected to node 4 and node 5,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and so we can draw in those nodes and the edges.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Then node 1 is connected to node 0 and node 3.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Here are those nodes and edges drawn in.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We can see that we can transform this graph, which doesn't look like a tree at all,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
into something that looks a little bit more like a tree. It branches out.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Hopefully, that gives you some idea of why we call these tree graphs.
