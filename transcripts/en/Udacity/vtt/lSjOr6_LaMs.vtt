00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is better + flight + search.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's do that together, and we'll talk about what happened.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay, I click submit, and I get taken to Google search results

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
for the phrase "better flight search."

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I can see in the URL better + flight + search.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What are these pluses doing there?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Because you didn't type them in the search form.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The answer is because URLs can't have spaces in them,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
your browser did what's called URL encoding or form encoding or URL escaping.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They're all basically words you'll see that refer to the same concept,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which is we turn spaces to pluses.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We also do some other things.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If we go back and enter some different text in here,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we can see even more behaviors.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Let me add an exclamation mark and hit submit.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now you can see in the URL we have this %21.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That's because exclamation marks generally also get escaped.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now, the behavior could be different in your browser.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
All browsers have slightly different behaviors in this regard,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but this is what we see in ours, and you'll probably see something similar.
