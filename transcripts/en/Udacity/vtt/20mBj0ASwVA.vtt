00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.695
Using the beautiful soup module, we can take all this code that we wrote fairly

00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:07.160
painstakingly in the first three units of the class, and I know that now that

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.790
you're a fairly experienced programmer, it doesn't seem too hard to write this

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.900
code. But this code is actually very fragile. It only works on very specific

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.436
ways of encoding link targets and we can replace that with much simpler code

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:24.000
that uses far fewer lines and works much better. We're doing that by importing

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.354
from bs4 which is a BeautifulSoup library. The BeautifulSoup definition, which

00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:32.506
allows us to create an object that represents a web page. Here, we're passing in

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:36.416
the contents of the page just like we were doing in get all links. And the

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:40.198
BeautifulSoup module provides definitions that give us a very easy way to

00:00:40.198 --> 00:00:44.010
extract all the links from a webpage. In the first part of the course where

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.376
we're writing this code ourselves, but we wanted to really understand how to do

00:00:47.376 --> 00:00:50.994
things and our goal is to learn about programming. If you're actually trying to

00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:54.634
solve problems, you're much better are finding a module like BeautifulSoup,

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:58.106
where someone has already put a lot of effort into figuring how to do this in

00:00:58.106 --> 00:01:01.522
the right way and written a tool that works much more robustly on much more

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:05.510
complex web pages than the code we wrote this. So, modules are a real big win

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.195
and we can use this without worrying about it polluting our namespace because we

00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:13.026
know the only name that we've imported here is the name BeautifulSoup. And we've

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:16.870
replaced these 18 lines of code with 6 lines that if you understand what the

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.714
module does, are much easier to understand and much simpler than having to

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:25.306
understand all 18 lines and they work a lot better. So, modules are a huge win,

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:28.958
they make it very easy to share code. And one of the things you should be

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.654
thinking about as you develop more programs, especially if you're developing

00:01:32.654 --> 00:01:36.462
them to actually solve problems, not just to learn about programming, if there's

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:39.878
a module that already exists that you can use to make your coding much more

00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:40.403
simple.
