00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.931
So with tokens in OAuth we can
now control authentication and

00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.171
authorization for our API Endpoints.

00:00:06.171 --> 00:00:09.680
But what happens when users
are using the endpoint too much?

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.770
If we have one data hog constantly
pinging the API, our other users might

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.680
experience drops in performance or may
not be able to access our API at all.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.030
Or maybe our API isn't available for
free and users should be paying for

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.090
a certain amount of access
over a period of time.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.110
With rate limiting, we can give
our server a bit more control over

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.640
the amounts of requests we will request
from a user over a certain time period.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.840
In this next video,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.870
I will make a rate limited inpoint
in a Flask web application.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.070
This exercise uses some more
advanced topics in Python.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.830
I've added some links in the instructor
notes that cover some of these topics

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.400
more in detail.
