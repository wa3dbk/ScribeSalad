00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.640
Here's our last problem for this lesson on multiplication on radicals. Try

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.367
multiplying these two binomials out that contain cube roots. Think carfully

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:11.777
when you simplify, and at the end, think about whether you can combine like

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:15.483
terms or like radicals. Good luck.
