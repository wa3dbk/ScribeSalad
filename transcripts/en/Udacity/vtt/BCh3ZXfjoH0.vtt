00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.210
What's actually happening
when a TCP connection opens?

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.260
Well what has to happen?

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.830
The two endpoints, the client and

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.760
server, have to get into agreement
that a connection exists.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.020
Well what information has to be
exchanged in order for that to happen?

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.990
Before anything happens, the client
knows the server's IP address and

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.920
port number, but the server doesn't
know anything about the client.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.900
So the client has to send
the server a message with,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.450
among other things,
its IP address and port number,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.940
saying that it wants to connect
to the server on its IP and port.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.840
But TCP does more than that.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.960
It also keeps track of the data
that each end point is sent.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.737
And make sure that the other
end point has received it, and

00:00:39.737 --> 00:00:43.366
make sure that the application sees that
data in order even if the underlying

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.540
network reorders the packets.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.710
The way that it does this is by putting
a sequence number on each packet.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.010
Each endpoint sends an acknowledgement
indicating when its

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.750
received a particular sequence number,
and if a packet goes missing the other

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.390
end point will notice there's no
acknowledgement and will re-transmit it.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.700
Also, sequence numbers start
out at a random number so

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.620
they're very unlikely to get confused
between one connection and another.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.900
So when the client sends
this first packet,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.690
it has a sequence number on it like
number one two three four five.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.150
And when the server sends back its first
response that has a different sequence

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.110
number, like nine, eight, seven, six,
it also contains an acknowledgement,

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.450
saying that the server has
received packets up to but

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.090
not including number one,
two, three, four, six.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.930
And then subsequently each packet either
end sends has an acknowledgement or

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.970
ack for short.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.630
That indicates one more than
the greatest sequence number.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.390
For which it knows it doesn't
need anything re sent.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.970
When the client sends the packet
containing its request.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.550
The server acknowledges that request
even before it sends the response.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.260
Then it will send the response and

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.810
the client will acknowledge each
packet that's used to send then.

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:55.390
For a realistically sized
file there will be many,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.930
many more of these before we're done.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.820
And since there will be many
more of these it's not just that

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.040
the server will be sending
a lot of data to the client.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.140
The client will also be sending
an Ack back to the server for

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.190
each packet of that data.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.770
And because that data is going to
be broken up into a lot of packets

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.500
each with its own sequence number on
it there are going to be a lot of

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.280
ack's flowing back.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.580
Even though the client isn't
transmitting any application data back.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.370
All those packets will
have data length zero.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.270
They'll still be telling
the server how much data has been

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.330
successfully received.
