00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The value proposition for a company that's selling services is kind of the same.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You just need to ask--what are core services that are part of your value proposition.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Consulting, a haircut, investment advice, and if you're selling whether it's software or hardware,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you could have separate services that are part of this whole product--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
pre- and post-sales services, finding the right solution, financing, free delivery.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Amazon makes a great business because in fact they could do 1-day delivery

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
or they could do 2-day Premier Service.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That is--service is sometimes, well, might seem to be ??? or kind of add ons

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
actually making your products work better than the competitors.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And then what are after-sales services--free maintenance, disposal, etc.

00:00:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And so all these add up again to what is it that your product features do.
