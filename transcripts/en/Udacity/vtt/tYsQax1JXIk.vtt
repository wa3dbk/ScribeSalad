00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
We already know how to do the first part of this.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.510
We just have to write a Boolean formula

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.140
for each single timestep.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.440
The second part is also not that difficult.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.090
If we are given an algorithm

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.590
and an input of that algorithm, we already know what the first snapshot

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.560
of the RAM is going to look like.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.220
The program will start at the first line of the program code,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.390
and the memory contains nothing but the input itself,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.910
so given the way that the Boolean formula is written,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.190
all we have to ensure that we enforce the variables

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.410
for the first snapshots

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.380
to represent that state that we already know,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.720
but we can ensure that, so for example,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.540
if in a Boolean formula, you want a variable x1 to be set to true,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.710
you would write it like this; you would have certain statements of the Boolean formula,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.300
and then you would just put the variable x1 here,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.970
and then continue the formula,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.730
and then you know it has to be set to true,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.470
so in this way, you can enforce the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.360
Boolean formula that represents the first snapshot

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.350
to present the memory of the RAM exactly at

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.780
time point t equals 0.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.570
The fourth one here

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.950
that the Boolean formula can only be satisfied

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.770
if the algorithm returns yes;

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.470
that is also not that difficult to check,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.480
because again using a technique like this here

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.440
all we have to do is ensure that at a certain point in time,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.320
the algorithm here is at the program line

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.960
or the RAM executes the line of the algorithm here

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.770
or one line of the algorithm here

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.000
that says we return yes

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.010
so that algorithm gives us the yes value.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.590
So the only part that requires a little more thought is the third part here,

00:01:32.590 --> 99:59:59.000
how we can ensure that various snapshots fit together.
