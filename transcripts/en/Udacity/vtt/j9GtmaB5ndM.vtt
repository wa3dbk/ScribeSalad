While we write our asset manager, asynchronous loading is one of the core

00:00:02.782 --> 00:00:06.542
features. Can you think of others that would be critical to have? Should it

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:10.210
have a cached asset management system? Should it need asynchronous callbacks on

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.851
loading success? What about batched asset loading, so that you can submit

00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:17.649
multiple file requests and have them loaded from a single call?
