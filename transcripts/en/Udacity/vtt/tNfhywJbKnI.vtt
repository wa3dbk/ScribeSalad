00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.286
So, when we simplify this, we subtract 18 from both sides and we get 3x squared

00:00:05.286 --> 00:00:11.044
equals negative 18. We then divide by 3 on both sides, we get x squared equals

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:17.154
negative 6, giving us our solutions of x equals plus or minus the square root of

00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:23.046
negative 6. And when we pull out the negative 1 as an i, we get x equals plus or

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:30.095
minus i times the square root of 6. This is two solutions, a plus i square root

00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:33.873
of 6 and a negative i square root of 6.
