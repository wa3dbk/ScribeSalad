00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410
There are three statements here that are true.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:08.780
The first one is true because f(n) clearly grow slower than g(n),

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.300
so g(n) grows at least as fast as f(n).

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.900
The second one is also true because h(n) grows even faster, so it outgrows f(n) also.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.320
The f(n) here is the slowest growing function, so it does not outgrown g(n),

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.190
but h(n) on the other hand that is the fastest growing function so it does outgrow g(n).

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.640
This one here is true also, and since h(n) is the fastest growing function,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.000
it's neither in O(f(n)) or in O(g(n)).

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.220
You can see the slowest growing function is always contained in O of the two

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.790
faster-growing functions and the fastest growing function is not contained in

00:00:49.790 --> 99:59:59.000
either O(f(n)) or O(g(n)), which are growing slower.
