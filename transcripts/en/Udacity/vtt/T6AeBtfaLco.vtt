00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.570
So the final change we're going to make, is thinking about our

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.600
random surfer model. If this was our model, if a page has

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.880
no incoming links, well, it's popularity ranking would be 0. We

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.540
don't want to have that be the case. If we think of

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.220
our random web surfer, well if she randomly starts at a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.240
page, she could randomly start at a page that has no links.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.060
If we made all the page scores 0, for pages with no

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.610
links, well, then it would be very hard for a new page

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.710
to get started. So, we don't want those to be 0,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.400
so we're going to have some random probability that you reach a

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.490
page even when it has no links. So that means we're going to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.180
add something to this sum so it's not zero when there are

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.800
no incoming links. And the other thing we're going to do

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.840
is we're going to scale this summation a little bit. And we're

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.560
going to scale that with what is called the damping function. And

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.080
that just means, if we think of our random web surfer again,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.300
even if she's following a path. That does have more

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.000
links. At some point, she might decide to get tired and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.570
give up and start again with a new random page. So,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.710
the dampening function determines how frequently, we think our random web

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.840
surfer will pick a random link, versus starting over again

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.070
on a new random page. So that's call the dampening value

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.110
and we are just going to use the dampening value to scale

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.660
this number. So, we'll call that d, that's the dampening constant.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.610
A typical value for that is something less than one,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.980
and a good value is something like 0.8. So now we're

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.430
going to change our rank function to take into account that. We're

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.510
going to have some initial value and if we want to keep the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.590
values in a reasonable range, instead of starting from one,

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.790
we're going to divide the values by a total number of pages.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.210
And the reason for that is just to keep the ranks

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.750
in some meaningful range. This will keep the ranks so the

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.520
total of the ranks when we start the sum of the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.400
ranks is 1, that gives them a little more meaning then if

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.600
the sum of the ranks was the number of pages. So

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.230
n is going to be the number of pages, the total number

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.150
in our corpus and d is the damping constant, and so

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.770
now we're going to change our initial values to divide them by n.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.500
This means, the sum of the paid ranks at the beginning will

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.970
be 1, and, we're going to change the way we compute the rank

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.190
by adding to it, a value that correspo... That gives

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.350
us the sense of starting over. So, the value that we're

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.970
going to use for this is 1 minus d, divided by n

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.890
and, that gives the notion that. That times when we don't

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.480
decide to do a new page. So, 0.8 of the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.800
time. We decide to follow a new page. So we're going to

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.920
multiply this by D. The times when we don't follow a

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.120
new page, that's one minus D. We're going to start over, and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.340
we're going to divide that by N, because N is the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.080
number of pages that the probability that this is the page

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.060
that would be picked when we start over. So now we've

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.740
got our recursive definition of page rank. We start by initializing

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.200
the rank n times at 0 to one minus, divided by

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.130
N, and then for as many times up, as we want,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.820
we're going to keep improving our results. By using this formula. For

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.570
each link that links to us, we're going to take it's popularity

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.030
on the last step, divide that by the number of out

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.290
links so it's dividing it by the number of other pages it

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.290
links to. Multiply that by our damping constant and that gives

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.020
the probability that this page was selected by the random web surfer,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.520
and then we're going to add the term that takes into

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.680
account the random web surfer might have started over from scratch and

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.800
picked a new random page. So, before we try to change

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.730
our Web search engine to actually program this, it's time for a

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.960
little quiz. And the quiz is, What is AltaVista? And if you don't know this,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.340
feel free to use Google, or DuckDuckGo, to find out. These are the choices so,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.250
it's the view from the Udacity headquarters

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.590
in Palo Alto. It's the most popular web

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.740
search engine in 1998. It is Spanish for,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.930
You're Terminated Baby and, it's a small town

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.740
in Virginia. And feel free to Google the answer if you don't know.
