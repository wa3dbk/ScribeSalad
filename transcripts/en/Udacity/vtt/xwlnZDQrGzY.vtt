Hi I'm Gabriele and
I'll be your instructor for

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.800
this short introduction to Objective-C.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.360
This course is tailored for
Swift developers.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.890
Our goal is to prepare you to dive into
an unfamiliar Objective-C code base and

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.620
migrate features from
Objective C to Swift.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.530
We'll be focusing on
the following skills.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.700

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.800
In lesson one you'll learn
the distinguishing language features

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.830
of Objective C.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.280
In lesson two we'll go over
some Objective C syntax and

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.600
you'll write some classes and
properties from scratch.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.810
In lesson 3, we'll talk about how
to write and call methods, a.k.a.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.980
send messages in Objective-C.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.680
With these new skills you'll
build a functioning game.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.230
In lesson 4, you'll port the app
GIF Maker from Objective-C to Swift,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.840
focusing on writing custom classes and
incorporating third party frameworks and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.913
extensions and lesson 5,

00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:56.430
you'll import more features of GIF
maker from Objective C to Swift

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.918
focusing on data persistence
with NSCoder and I NSK.driver.

00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:04.694
To wrap things up in less than six,
we'll review the most common challenges

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:08.296
for interoperability between
the languages of iOS and you'll complete

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:11.381
a set of coding challenges to
sharpen your interrupt skills.

00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:16.639
