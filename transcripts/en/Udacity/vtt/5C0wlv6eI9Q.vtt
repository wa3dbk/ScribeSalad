00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We just looked to an example where measuring coverage

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
was useful in finding a bug in a piece of code.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What I want to show you now is another piece of code. This would be a really quick example.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The coverage is not particularly useful in spotting the bug.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And so, what I have here on the screening is a broken function.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The job is to determine whether a number is prime.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That is to say, it doesn't correctly do its job of determining whether the number is prime.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, let's look at the logic in this function. So, this prime takes a number.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If the number is less than or equal to 1 or divisible by 2, then it's not prime.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now, once the number passes that test, what we are going to do is loop over every number

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
between 3 and the square root of the number 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and check if the original input number divides evenly by that number.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If it does, then of course, we don't have a prime number.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And if all of those tests failed to find a divisor, then we have a prime number.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And so, as can you see, there is a little bit of test code here that checks

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
how this function responds for the numbers 1 through 5 and 23, 24.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And so, what to do is let's just run this code.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This code has correctly computed that 1 is not prime, 2 is not prime, 3 is prime, 4 is not, but 5 is.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Similarly, 20, 21, and 22 are not prime numbers. They all have divisors

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
23 is prime, and 24 is not.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So, for this 10 examples, this prime function has successfully identified

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
whether the input is prime or not--so, let's run the code coverage tool.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 We got the same output. Now, let's look at the results.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So, we can see out of the 20 statements in the file, all of them run,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and none of them failed to be covered.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Statement coverage gives us a perfect result for this particular code and yet another set is wrong.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Here of the same code and ID, so let's run out. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The output is what we expect, and what I would like you to do is do 2 things.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
First of all, at least 1 test case, where you check a value for prime and

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the code here returns the wrong result.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And then second, create a new function is prime 2 that fixes the error.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
That is to say a correctly identifies for any natural number input.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That is to say any input 1 or larger whether it's prime.
