00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now we're going to use this in our blind signature scheme.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Alice will create a hundred messages like this, each one with a different random nonce.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But what she's going to add to the messages is an identity list made up of m of these values.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We'll talk more about what these are in a second as well as the usual value of the bill.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What we want these i values to be are things that reveal Alice's identity,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
if someone knows enough about them, but otherwise reveal nothing.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Here's what they are.  They are a concatenation of two hash values.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
H is a cryptographic hash function where the property we want is

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
where the two parts XORed gives you Alice's identity, and it's easy to create these values.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We can set the first one to a random bitstring,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and we send the second one to Alice's identity XORed with the random bitstring.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Which of these would be the minimum amount of information

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
needed by the bank to verify these messages?

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
All would be enough to learn Alice's identity if someone had both parts.
