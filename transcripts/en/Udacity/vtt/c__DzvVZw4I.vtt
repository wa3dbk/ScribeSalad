00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All right, this is where it actually gets really interesting and a little bit whacky.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We just showed that if you a had a solution to SAT, you could use it to solve 3 colorability

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and maybe that's not so weird because 3 colorability is about finding

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
some kind of a satisfying coloring and so we have the satisfying formula--not so weird.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, what we're going to do is the other direction to show that 3 colorability is NP hard.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We know it's an NP, but is it NP hard. If it's NP hard, it must be NP complete because it's an NP.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But to show that it's NP hard that means we have to take some NP hard problem

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and solve it by way of 3 colorability.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That means we have to be able to take a satisfiability formula, somehow express it as a

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
graph coloring problem, and if we can do that, that means a solution to the graph coloring problem

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
resolves satisfiability and therefore, anything in NP.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I went and took a little bit of a short cut just so we can get to the punchline fast,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and we're only going to deal not with the full satisfiability problem which gives

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
any kind of boolean formula, but specifically 3-SAT.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
3-SAT or just the satisfiability formulas have the form like so where the whole formula

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is a bunch of ends of clauses, so it's clause end, clause end, clause end, clause end and so on

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
until all the clauses have been expressed.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Each clause itself is the or of three literals and the literal itself is either

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
a variable or a delegation of a variable and ???.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So you could have something that looks like X or not Y or z

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and w or X or not z and that's a 3-SAT problem.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's not a very hard 3-SAT problem, but it's a 3-SAT problem.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And with clauses, each clause has 3-literals, each literal has either

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the name of a variable or not the name of a variable.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now, just so happens that this problem is also NP hard, it's an NP complete,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
just like satisfiability but it's a lot easier to work with.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So somebody walks up to us and says, "Well, I have a general satisfiability question."

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
It might be easier if they walked up to us and said, "I have a 3-SAT question."

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now, this is not easier in the computational complexity sense, it's just easier just working with it

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and writing an algorithm sense, but the algorithm--the problem itself is equally hard.
