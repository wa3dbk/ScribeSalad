Okay, great job with the refactoring
to normalize the shopping lists.

00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:06.830
While you were working on that,
I made two new screens for sharing.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.870
Let me show you what they look like.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.450
You might have remembered the sharing
flow from when I mentioned it before.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.590
So you have some list open.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.780
Let's say a generic grocery list.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.700
And you can click the share icon.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.490
The Share icon will take you to
the new Share List activity that I've

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.580
created for you.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.700
Here you'll see a list of your friends.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.200
And if you want to add a new friend,
you can click the Add New Friend button.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.430
This takes you to
the Add Friend activity,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.090
which has a list of
all users in the app.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.850
If you want to add one
of them as a friend,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.120
you simply need to click
their email address, and

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.400
you'll be taken back to the Share List
activity with the new friend added.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.080
Things get more complicated when you
actually want to start sharing the lists

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.040
with these friends.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.140
But for now, let's start with just this
ShareList AddFriendActivity interaction.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.790
All that I want is for you to make it so
when you click add friend,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.540
you see a list of users,
you could select the user, and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.290
then they end up here in the ShareList.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.840
Right now, displaying the list of all
users of the app should be pretty

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.960
straightforward.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.610
After all, you know how to
use Firebase list of actors.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.620
And you have a location in your Firebase
database that contains a list of

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.680
all users.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.959
But what about this
list of friends here?

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.890
Remember that our database design
included a node called user friends,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.920
which I've been told I
haven't talked much about.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.420
Let's take a look at that node
in the database design schema.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.540
So here's the database design
that we're going for, and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.550
we can see the user friends node here.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.360
If we expand it, you'll see that we're
going to have a list of user emails.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.180
For every user that has friends,
they'll be a list.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.680
And then under each user email,
they'll be a list of friend emails.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.320
You can go ahead and
put an entire user object here, so

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.310
that you'll have access
to the user's name.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.540
So getting that list of users that you
need to show on the sharing screen

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.600
is a simple as attaching
a list right here.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.130
To the encoded email of the user
that you're interested in.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.190
Okay, I'm excited for you to add these
new screens, and I'm sending over

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.880
the exact specifications, and
the code, for the new screens now.
