00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.390
&gt;&gt; So note that both the state at the top and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.760
this state at the bottom have a equal amount of difference compared to

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.840
goal state. We could've chosen either state to go further. For now,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.360
we going to go with the one at the bottom. The reason of course is that if I

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.350
put A on D that will get in the way of solving the rest of the problem. For now,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.090
let us go with this state. Later on we will see how an AI agent will

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.090
decide that this is not a good path to take and this is the better path to take.
