N² kind of beats everything here. So it's Θ(n²). It's order of n², as well as order of n³.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay. So basically (log n)⁷ beats 9n(log n)² and n²/³ beats (log n)⁷ and 9n(log n)² beats n²/³.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I think it was the most dominant one. So let's see what the options were.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Θ(n²), O(n²), and O(n³).

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm going to add a little like for n³, this is valid because the big O notation is an upper bound.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Upper bound. Okay. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yup.
