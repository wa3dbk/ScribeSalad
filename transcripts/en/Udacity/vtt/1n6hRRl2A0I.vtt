00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's consider a formula--I'm going to write a new one.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's say You equals Me-squared.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're treating these formulas as strings.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now when we substitute numbers into this,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we get something like 123 equals 45-squared.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What happens when we call eval on this string?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What eval has to do is it takes it's input, which is a string,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and then it has a process of parsing that string into a parse tree.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The parse tree would say something like this is a comparison,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and it has an operator, which is a number, which is 123,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and another operand, which is an expression which has the number 45,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and then the exponentiation operator, and then the number 2.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Python builds up a data structure that looks something like that.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
There's another operation of code generation in which Python takes this tree

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and says in order to evaluate this tree I'm going to do something

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
like load the number 123 and then load the number 45 and then do an operation on that

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and so on and so on and then return the result.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That's a lot of work to build up this tree, generate the code,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and then finally, the final operation after we've come up with this,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
is to execute this code and come up with an answer,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
which in this case would be false.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now, this is a lot of work for eval to do, and it seems like there's a lot of duplicate work,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
because we're going to do this for every permutation of the digits,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but each time we go through this part of the work, the parsing,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
is going to look exactly the same with the exception of the specific numbers

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
down here at the bottom, but the rest of the parse tree is going to look the same.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Similarly, this part of the work, the code generation,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
will also look the same except these numbers will differ.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We're going to have to repeat that over and over again.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
What we'd like is an approach where we can only do these two parts once

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and then pass in the specific numbers and then get our final result back.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But one this I should say is that the eval function doesn't take a statement,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
like this function definition. It takes an expression.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Furthermore, we don't really need this name F. That was kind of arbitrary.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We'd be fine with having an expression that represents a function

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
but doesn't have a name associated with it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Then we can pass that directly to eval.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It turns out there is a way to do that in Python.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
There is a keyword that creates a function as an expression.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
That keyword is lambda. It's kind of a funny keyword.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I would've preferred them to use function or fun or maybe just def and leave the name out,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
but they chose lambda. It's based on the lambda calculus, the Greek letter λ,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
which is a branch of formal mathematics defining functions.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The syntax is fairly similar to the syntax of a definition of a function,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
except we leave the name out. It's an anonymous function with no name.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It also turns out for some reason we leave out the parentheses.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
We just say lambda Y, O, U, M, E, then a colon, and we leave out the return,

00:03:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and then we just put in the rest of the code--100 times blah, blah, blah, blah.
