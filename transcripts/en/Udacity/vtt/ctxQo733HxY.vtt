00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.351
Since we are on the topic of graphs, let's just look at a bunch of different

00:00:03.351 --> 00:00:08.501
graphs of log functions. Here we have f of x equals log based 2 of x, f of x

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:13.315
equals log based 4 of x, f of x equals log based 10 of x, and finally, f of x

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:20.734
equals log based e of x. Here, the base is that special number e that we

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:24.666
mentioned before. What I would like to know right now is what point all of

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.819
these paths go through?
