00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
For this problem we have the same clique function,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but instead of counting how many units of time it takes to execute clique(4),

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we're going to write a more general function that calculates

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
how many units of time it takes to execute clique(n) as a function of n.
