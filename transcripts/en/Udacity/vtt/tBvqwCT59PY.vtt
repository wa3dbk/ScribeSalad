That's all I have for closures, and
we've come to the end of the course.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.790
You have a solid start now on Swift, and

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.880
the tools you need to
make your dream app.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.730
So, go build stuff, make animations,

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.330
filter arrays, and
don't forget to finish your exercises.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.500
I can't wait to see the apps you'll
make with your newfound understanding of

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.200
Swift syntax.
