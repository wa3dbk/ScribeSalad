00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.120
Now that we have seen
an address translation,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.960
let's do an address translation quiz.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.300
Suppose that we have a process with
a page table that only has four entries

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.310
that contain these frame numbers.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.449
Suppose that this machine has
a 16-bit virtual address base, and

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.130
a 20-bit physical address space.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.140
That is,
the virtual address is a 16-bit address.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.030
But the physical address
is a 20-bit address.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.080
Then, given this 16-bit virtual address,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.460
what is the physical
address it translates into?

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.240
And given this virtual address, what
physical address does it translate into?
