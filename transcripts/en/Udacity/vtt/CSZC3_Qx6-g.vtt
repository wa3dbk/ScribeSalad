00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And let's say in expectation, when you go forward 100 m and come back 100 m,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
you are to be where you started.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So 7 will be the correct mean. Now σ‘² is more difficult. It turns out the variances still add up.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And the way to see this is if we started over here at a well-defined zero position,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and you go to over here and you have some uncertainty as to where you might be.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And then you hit the ball back over here, your uncertainty will increase. It won't decrease.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That makes 2σ² the correct answer.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So even though we substituted the plus sign by a minus sign,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the uncertainty that comes in for either of these steps over here

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
will add up just the way it did before.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And I have to grant you, this wasn't an easy question and I hope you got it right.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If not, think about it and perhaps do the same quiz again.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
There's some deep insight here, which is for the means the arithmetic I'm giving you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
always apply straight, but for the variances things are counter-intuitive.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
When we add to random variables, the variances always

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
just add up no matter what the operation is  plus or minus.
