00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this problem, we want to be able to split a string

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
by more than just spaces and white space but instead punctuation.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This allows us to better index a web page

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so that we aren't fooled by punctuated text following a word, such as a comma,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and instead we are able to search for that word itself

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
instead of the word and the comma.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The first thing I do is initialize the output list.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This will contain the words separated by the splitlist.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
With this variable I'm going to keep track of whether or not I am at a point that's a split.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This one might make more sense later, so let's keep going.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Using the for loop construct like this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
iterates through the string source 1 character at a time.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If the current character is one we're supposed to split on, such as a comma,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
then we're going to set atsplit to True.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If we're at a character that isn't in the splitlist

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we're at a split point, we're going to create a new entry in the list.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So if we're looking at this example up top,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
if we just had a space and then we have a T

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
where space is something that we want to split on and T is not,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
then we want to create a new entry that will contain what becomes the word 'the'

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
instead of appending it on to the previous one after.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If we're not at a split point but rather building up a word,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
such as in the middle of 'After', we simply add the current character to the end of that word,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
output [-1] finds the last entry in the output list,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and we simply append the character using the + operator.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Once we've gone through every character in our source string, we return the output list.
