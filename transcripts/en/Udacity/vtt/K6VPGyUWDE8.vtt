00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.215
So this first paragraph in fact, was written by the great novelist James Joyce

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:09.743
and it's from his novel Ulysses. And this, we can deem quite creative, in fact

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:14.520
it was, because it did something quite different. Not only different, but

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.357
unique. So the second paragraph was authored by someone suffering from

00:00:18.357 --> 00:00:23.273
schizophrenia. And who's speaking really in what we call word solid. And this

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:28.134
is not creative. So these two quotes demonstrate that creativity is something

00:00:28.134 --> 00:00:33.422
more than just originality. What it is and what it isn't. They're both equally

00:00:33.422 --> 00:00:38.140
original but the first also solve the problem in an adaptive and useful way.
