00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:05.542
And the answer is, all of these could possibly go wrong. If we're a responsible

00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:09.234
programmer, we should definitely at least worry about these first two. You

00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:12.535
probably only need to worry about these if you're really paranoid. There

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:15.769
certainly are situations where people do worry a lot about cosmic rays hitting

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.525
processors. And there are lots of places where you have to worry about what

00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:22.935
happens if power gets out in the middle of executing this. We're not going to be

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:26.301
paranoid enough to worry about these two in this class, but there are some links

00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:29.626
at the bottom to places where you do worry about these two. We are going to be

00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:34.073
responsible programmers though, so we need to learn to deal with these cases.
