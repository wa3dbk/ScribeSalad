00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.210
Let's look at another way to solve quadratic equations, this time we're

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.423
going to use a method called completing the square we'll see this method again

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:11.820
when we look at conic sections so be sure you get familiar with it. Let's start

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.572
by reviewing the perfect square trinomial patterns, what numbers would fill in

00:00:15.572 --> 00:00:19.044
each of these blanks be sure to indicate the appropriate sign in each box as

00:00:19.044 --> 00:00:25.900
well. So here you use a plus or a minus symbol, and here you'll put the number.
