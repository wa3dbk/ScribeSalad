00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.640
In this session, we're going to take
a detour from core programming concepts

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.490
and focus on data processing.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.930
Specifically, we'll look at
working with PLIST and JSON data.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.070
These are two formats commonly used
by iOS developers to store data and

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.440
send and receive data to and
from a network.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.100
Let's get started.
