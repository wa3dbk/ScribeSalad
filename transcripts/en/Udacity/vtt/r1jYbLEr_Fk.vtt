00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.802
Now that we know what the discriminant is. For a quadratic it's b squared minus

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:09.167
4 a c. What do you think it is about the discriminant that's important for

00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:14.080
determining how many real roots we'll have. Is it its absolute value? Whether or

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.797
not it's a perfect square? Whether it's rational or irrational? Whether it's

00:00:18.797 --> 00:00:22.243
even or odd? Or whether it's positive, negative or zero?
