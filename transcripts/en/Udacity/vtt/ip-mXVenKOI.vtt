00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.360
As a member of a class, an object can be
associated with variables and constants.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.610
Variables and constants that
are associated with a particular class

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.780
are known as properties.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.300
We're going to talk about
three types of properties.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.090
Stored properties, type properties,
and computed properties.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.750
Let's start with stored properties.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.220
In Swift, there's a strong
emphasis on immutability.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.250
So you'll see a lot more properties
defined as constants than in

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.690
other languages.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.610
Let's talk about how those
constants are initialized.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.840
Stored properties must be set when
an instance of a class is initialized.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.680
Here we're setting
the title director and

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.360
release year to strings being
passed into the init method.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.140
In this case the parameters have
the same name as the properties.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.780
To distinguish the properties
from the parameters,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.280
you can use self to represent
the object being initialized.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.450
Initialization would look like this.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.460
To call the initializer instead
of using the name init,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.270
we use the name of the class.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.120
And then if we want to access
the properties that we just set,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.620
we use dot syntax.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.860
So that's the name of the object.the
name of the property and here

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.990
in the sidebar we can see that the title
of Thursday night movie is Point Break.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.470
Notice that I 've used
external parameter names here,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.120
external parameter names
are required for init methods.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.490
There is another option for
setting an object stored properties.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.400
You can give them a default value, off
course in this case that wouldn't work

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.690
out so well because the director
property is a constant.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.690
So it can't be changed.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.810
But let's say we were only interested
in movies directed by Rob Reiner.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.400
We could set the default value of
director in the property definition and

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.394
then not bother setting
it in our init-method.
