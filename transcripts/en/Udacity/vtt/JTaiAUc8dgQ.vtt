00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.570
Google Cast is a technology that let's
you connect your application to the TV.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.310
The biggest and
most beautiful screen in the home.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.010
In this lesson,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.570
we'll learn how to add Cast Support
to your existing Android app.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.120
We'll cover the basics of
sender receiver topology, and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.120
show them in action by adding Cast
Support to the Universal Media Player.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.600
Here's how UAMP looks when we start.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.750
And here it is after we've added Cast.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.308
Now you'll be able to do this.

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:31.820
That's how easy it is to Cast
your app to the big screen.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.400
Now as Timothy mentioned,
the average TV viewer spends about

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.630
three hours a day in front
of their television.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.940
Google Cast is an opportunity for
you to capture that time and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.130
engage with your users in new and
exciting ways.
