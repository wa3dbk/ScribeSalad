00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.890
Now, let's get a little bit more work done with some adjacency matrices,

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.840
just so you can get a bit more comfortable.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.140
So let's talk about inverse graphs.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.030
In the unit, we discussed how to create the inverse graph as a graph

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.100
that helps us solve the clique problem.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.110
So, for example, the inverse graph of the graph that I drew before would be the graph

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.380
with the red edges here, so quite a different graph here.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.350
Now, how do you represent this as an adjacency matrix.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.170
Well, to diagnose is the because we're not allowing loops anywhere in here, so the diagnose to 0's,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.280
and you know when once we have in the adjacency matrix are from the D to A or from A to D

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.060
so the matrices is symmetric and from B to D and everything else is 0--

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.190
means that all of these edges disappear in the inverse graph.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.770
Now, how do you represent this in Python.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.190
Well, an easy way to represent a matrix in Python is as a list of list,

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.400
so to look at some output of some code,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.870
we define a completely empty graph here. Now, we print the graph we see.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:15.050
But this is just a list of list with five 0's in our list, and if we invert this graph,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.460
when we see that we get the graph of all 1's except for the diagonal here

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.870
of course since we don't have any loops.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.440
So what I want you to do is write an inverse graph function such that it takes a graph

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.280
or a list of list and outputs a list of list, which is the inverse of the input graph.
