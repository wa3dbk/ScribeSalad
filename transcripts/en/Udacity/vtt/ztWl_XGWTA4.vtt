00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.949
Now, that we've talked about what an equation really is and what types of

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:08.192
equations there are, let's actually build some up. To do that, we're going to

00:00:08.204 --> 00:00:12.640
keep helping Grant deal with his manufacturing process. Since Grant's Gleaming

00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:17.132
Glasses has started manufacturing now, they actually have to pay for things,

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:22.375
namely, the materials they use to make glasses wipers and nozzles. To buy just

00:00:22.387 --> 00:00:27.520
the material that he needed to make the wipers that were produced in the first 4

00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:32.640
days, Grant spent $598. He's thinking that next week, he'll need to spend around

00:00:32.652 --> 00:00:37.773
$750 to start the nozzle manufacturing process. We know from that chart we made

00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:41.921
earlier, that he was able to make 92 glasses wipers in the first 4 days. Oh, and

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.734
he also told me that he took his friends out to lunch and he spent 54 more

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:49.864
dollars on that. To plan for the future, Grant is getting a little bit worried.

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:54.044
There are a lot of different numbers he needs to keep track of. He wants to know

00:00:54.056 --> 00:00:58.028
how much he spends on the materials to make just one set of wiper blades, but he

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.533
needs our help to sift through all these numbers.
