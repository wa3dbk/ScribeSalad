00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.843
This line goes 3 units up for every unit that it goes to the right. If we look

00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:11.548
at this point right here, for example, and we step 1 unit to the right, we need

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.165
to count up 1, 2, 3 units before we hit the graph again. We can draw a right

00:00:17.177 --> 00:00:22.229
triangle going over 1 and up 3. This then, is the slope of this line.
