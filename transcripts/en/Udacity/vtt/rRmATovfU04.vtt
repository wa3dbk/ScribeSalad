00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here is your Facebook or G+ page, and of course you're smiling.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
On it is your list of friends, and we already know it's either 80 or 20 friends.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In expectation it's 50 friends.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's pick a random one of your friends, like this one.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This person will also have a Facebook or a G+ page.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Before I raise the question how many friends this person has,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
let's consider that this might be either a type A or a type B person.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Keep in mind that type A have 80 friends and type B have 20 friends.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The question I have for you is what are the chances you picked a type A friend?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This should be a number between 0 and 1.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm also going to ask you for the opposite.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What are the chances you picked a type B?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Please enter both numbers, and these numbers should sum up to 1.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Submit and then next.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I should warn you this is a challenging question.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If you don't get this right, don't worry.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This is the type of stuff you'll know when you've taken the class.

00:01:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I just want to tease you a little bit in the beginning.
