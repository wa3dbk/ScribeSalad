00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.530
Let's take stock of where you are.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.830
You start with a graph G, from G,
you can construct its Laplacian, L of G.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.064
Now, suppose you have a partition of G,
that implies the petitioning

00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:15.237
of the vertices into two sets,
call them V+ or V-.

00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:16.725
In linear algebraic terms,

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:20.200
you can translate this vortex
partition into a partition vector.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.900
Each vertex i is assigned
to one partition or

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.280
the other designated by a +1 or -1.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.720
Now suppose you want to know
the number of cut edges in G.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.970
Then you can count it algebraically.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.220
That suggests that partitioning could
be viewed as choosing an X to minimize

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.850
this quantity.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.890
So this becomes a common
notarial optimization problem.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.570
Formally we want an x that minimizes
the number of cut edges subject to two

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.860
conditions.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.500
First you want to assign every vertex
to one partition or the other and

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.360
you want the same number of
vertices in each partition.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.210
This problem is
unfortunately NP-Complete.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.200
Rats!

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.480
So to work around that,
let's relax the problem a little.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.290
Let's start by taking away
the requirement that we assign exactly

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.010
a +1 or -1 to every vertex.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.429
If you do so, then there's
a really neat fact we can use.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.920
This fact combines everything we know
about Graph Laplacians, along with a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.390
cool theorem from linear algebra called
the Courant-Fisher Minimax Theorem.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.550
If we're allowed to use any vector y,

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.730
where y is normalized in a certain
way and it's elements sum to 0,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.580
then the vector y that minimizes
this quantity is actually q1.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.300
Q1, you'll remember,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.430
is the eigenvector corresponding
to the second smallest eigenvalue.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.040
And in fact the minimum value simplifies
to something that is proportional to

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.600
that eigenvalue.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.320
So what does this mean?

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.980
Let's go back to the original
optimization problem.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.610
Our most recent fact tells us that the
optimal value is at least this quantity.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.120
To turn all this into an algorithm
you need one more idea.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.570
Choosing x to be q1 give us a lower
bound on the thing we want.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.070
But how do we take a q1, and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.460
actually turn it into something
that is a partition vector.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.140
In other words, something that has plus
or minus 1 values in all the entries?

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.470
Do you remember our spring analogy?

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.260
In fact, the Laplacian derived from
the spring system gives us a second

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.990
smallest eigenvector
that looks like this.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.170
If you plot the components
of the eigenvector for

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.545
the second smallest eigenvalue,
you get something that looks like this.

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:20.440
It's sine curvy,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.210
because that's what the fundamental
modes of the spring system look like.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.130
And as it turns out,
half of its elements are positive, and

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.740
the other half are negative.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.340
So that suggests
the following algorithm.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.160
First, compute the Laplacian for
the graph.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.930
Then compute its second
smallest eigen pair.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.880
Then determine the partition
using the sines of

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.840
the components of the eigenvector.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.695
So, that was a lot of work, but
the final algorithm is very compact.

00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:50.805
And indeed for plainer algorithms
it works really, really well.

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:54.315
Here are two examples of what the
spectral partitioning algorithm produces

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:55.805
on two graphs.

00:02:55.805 --> 00:02:56.385
Hey.

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:57.795
Someone should make
a t-shirt out of these.
