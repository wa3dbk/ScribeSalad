Use each side of the equation now as the exponent of e. And then simplify the

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:10.630
left-hand side. What equation does that leave us with? Remember that inverse

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.670
property we talked about before. A, taken to the power of log base a of x is

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.270
just equal to x.
