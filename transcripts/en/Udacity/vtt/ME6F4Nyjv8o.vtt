00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.570
Now that we have our map drawn,

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.720
we need to draw circles representing our attendance data on top of it.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.980
The first step in doing this is to actually load our attendance data.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.870
Remember, we used our initial d3.json load function to load the GeoJSON data,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.620
but we never loaded the attendance data that we've been working with all along.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.637
In order to load our attendance data,

00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:29.960
we can do exactly what we have previously done.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.477
In this case using an intermediate data transform function to convert our

00:00:35.477 --> 00:00:40.970
attendance to an integer and our date to a JavaScript date object.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.640
Which we will then pass to a function as a call back

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.140
that I've defined as plot points.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.740
The plot points function is going to act similarly to the draw

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.780
function of previous lessons that gets past a single argument, in this case,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.900
data, which corresponds to our attendance data.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.520
And inside of it we will put the code that

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.010
will draw the circles corresponding to the attendance of each World Cup.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.280
The only difference from what we've done before is that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.000
we're actually calling a d3 data loading function.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.550
In this case, d3.tsv.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.620
Inside of our other call back function, with loads the GeoJSON.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.580
This is perfectly alright and simply has the effect of saying,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.126
first load my map data, with d3.json, world countries, GeoJSON.

00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:36.210
And once that file's loaded call the draw function,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.850
passing the GeoJSON data to it, and then inside of the draw function you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.170
make another call to a data loading function.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.330
In this case d3.tsv, that says when you get through this line

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.080
of the draw function, load the world_cup_geo.tsv file.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.070
And once that file's loaded, call the plot_points function so

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.826
that the order of functions is called in the following.

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:10.580
First, d3.json is called to load world_countries, which gets passed to draw.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.240
And inside of draw, towards the end, we call d3.tsv.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.620
Which asynchronously loads the World Cup data for the attendances.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.950
And once that file's loaded gets passed to the plot points function.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.890
And in theory, if we wanted to do more data loading,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.698
we can simply put another call to d2.json or

00:02:33.698 --> 00:02:39.925
d2.tsv inside of our plot points, and can nest these somewhat infinitely, but I

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:44.210
would say it's a bad practice to go too far deep down this nesting of callbacks.
