00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.040
So focusing on details first is a really common

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.720
problem in design and in development because when you do

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.495
this you can really only optimize locally. So what's a

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:13.700
good solution for this problem? Well in design we have

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.880
a technique it's called wireframing or low res wireframing. It

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.110
helps us really focus on the UX first and the

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.266
big picture. Without getting caught in the UI details too

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.060
soon. I know in development, they do something very similar?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.482
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:29.550
&gt;&gt; In development there's a really easy trap to fall into,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.479
is when you start coding, you you just want to create functions.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.470
&gt;&gt; And you don't want to think about

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.040
abstraction and you don't want to think about encapsulation.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.160
&gt;&gt; So as a Java developer maybe you make the static class and you

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.230
have a lot of methods in it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.960
and you forget about interfaces and classes altogether.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.520
&gt;&gt; That's again an example of in development,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.780
where when you focus on the details kind

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.230
of bad things happen. So it's kind of

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.230
always a good idea in development and design

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.000
to think about the big picture first. So the sign in and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.880
the check out example we just gave you, imagine that is part

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.190
of an experience of a cookie buying application. So here's how you

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.599
really get started, imagine there's a task that your user wants to

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.930
complete. So for this example, it's I'm hungry for cookies I want to

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.060
get some and eat the cookies, basically. So then you think about

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.080
what steps does your user need to go through to complete this

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.310
task? So this is an easy example cause we only have one task.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.350
So the steps would be, sign in decide which cookie you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.550
want, pay for your cookies and then eat the cookies. So when

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.790
we write out each of these steps at a high level like

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.640
this, each of these steps is kind of like a Java interface.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.170
&gt;&gt; Exactly when you think about a Java interface, it's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.310
something that doesn't have any implementation, so you're not really

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.720
thinking about the low level details but you're thinking about

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.730
the contract that interface has with other interfaces and classes.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.510
&gt;&gt; Which in this case

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.110
if you look at the steps, it's how these steps connect with each other.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.680
&gt;&gt; So instead of focusing just on one step and nothing else,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.330
you're really thinking about the big picture. Exactly, so now that we're

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.470
thinking about the sign in experience as part of our overall flow

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.960
in order to buy cookies, how do you think we should start?

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.350
&gt;&gt; Do we even need a sign in experience? You know actually, we

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.920
might not actually need a Sign In experience. We could have an anonymous

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.788
experience because what if I just want to install the

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:13.610
app and just get cookies. And maybe after I've used the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.650
application or maybe even gotten some cookies for the first

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.560
time, I might think, okay maybe I'll use this application again.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.610
&gt;&gt; That's a good point but actually the way I would use

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.930
this application is that I actually do want to sign in because

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.820
I want to see my order history any my payment history. And

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.480
actually I want to place orders that I've already placed before. Okay.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.100
&gt;&gt; So for me, like for someone like me, if I was a user, I would actually

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.710
want the sign in experience sooner rather than

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.080
later. So we could actually give the user

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.270
an option of just getting straight into the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.570
app and buying cookies and just skipping sign in.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.120
&gt;&gt; Right. Or for users that are more

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.810
like you, we could let them sign in initially.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's true, so actually what we could do is, instead

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.540
of having this sign in happen up front maybe we can actually.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.440
&gt;&gt; Allow them to flow through this application without signing in but when they

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.670
actually need to then block them with the sign in. Just before check out.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.150
&gt;&gt; I like that,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.730
that would actually end up in a much nicer flow. Yeah.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.810
&gt;&gt; This is great I hadn't even thought about

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.310
it but now that if we actually move the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.530
sign in to this step it actually ends up

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.900
in a much better application. I agree, I think

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.600
that using low res wire framing really helped us

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.500
elevate the whole discussion. We could look at the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.870
sign in experience and really see how it made

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.380
the most sense to put in the application over all.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.990
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.780
&gt;&gt; Which again it results in a much better application

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.520
for the end user. Yep.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.180
&gt;&gt; So, we haven't really changed anything.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.670
&gt;&gt; We've just thought about it at a high level and optimized how they

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.190
link up just like good interfaces should

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.150
and we can worry about the implementation later.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.710
&gt;&gt; I think, this deserves a fist bump. Low res framing wire for the win.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.210
&gt;&gt; Boom.
