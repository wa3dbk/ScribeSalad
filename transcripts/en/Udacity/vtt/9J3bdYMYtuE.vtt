00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.930
Now you've written a lot of code and mercifully the application is nearly done.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.160
I'll give you the final piece. Here in the CarShareApp class, you make a

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.796
simulation object, we ask it to read it's input. Then we load the passengers,

00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:22.889
and drive the cars. Also, so that you see what's going on, I've added a couple

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:28.686
of print statements to the car class. Here in the tryToAdd method, we print out

00:00:28.686 --> 00:00:35.014
whenever the driver has picked up a passenger. And in the drive method, we

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:40.879
print out, whenever the driver has dropped off a passenger. Now I would like

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.714
you to, run the car share app, with these inputs here. So Jane has a car, that

00:00:45.714 --> 00:00:50.958
can hold four people including herself, wants to go to destination four. Fred

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:54.762
has a two seater wants to go to destination two. And these are all passengers,

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:58.480
they want to go to these destinations. The minus one signifies the end of

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.212
input. Go ahead and run the app, and tell me in which order do passengers get

00:01:05.212 --> 00:01:07.580
dropped off.
