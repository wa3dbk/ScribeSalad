00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.440
So in general, we know that the logarithm of some number is really an exponent.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.834
We can take the log of any number a, so long as this argument a is greater than

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:17.163
0. The other condition we need is that b must be our base. And its gotta be

00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:22.790
greater than zero and not equal to 1. If b were 1, then a would have to be 1.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.786
And x could be anything since 1 raised to any power always equals 1. And just

00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:32.800
like before we see that our base is the base of our log rhythm. And the

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.585
exponent is the answer to our logarithm. And a is the number that we take the

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:38.840
logarithm of.
