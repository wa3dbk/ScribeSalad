00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.560
What if we make a function that does all of that work up front and

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.650
then we just let the Van and the Cop class do a tiny bit of customization for

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.470
whatever is left to make them different from regular cars.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.380
We would call this new function we're building a superclass.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.290
That term includes the word class, because this function will be

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.610
creating a lot of similar objects and it includes the word super, because these

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.350
other classes will use the output from the superclass as their starting point.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.960
Let's name the function Car,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.010
since it's going to be creating objects that have the generic moving behavior.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.220
And then Van and Cop will be even more specific versions of it.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.030
Which parts of Van and Cop do you think could be moved up into the body of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.320
the Car constructor function?
