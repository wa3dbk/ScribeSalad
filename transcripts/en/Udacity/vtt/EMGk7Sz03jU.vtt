00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.142
For the first one, you should have a base of 4, since you have the repeated

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:08.624
multiplication of 4. And you have it repeated one, two, three times. So, we have

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:13.005
4 to the third. Here, we have repeated multiplication of 6. So, 6 is my base and

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:17.373
I have it repeated one, two, three, four, five times. Here, I just have one 7.

00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:21.817
So, I'm going to put 7 as my base. I don't have any repeated multiplication, I

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.437
just have the 7 once. So, my exponent is a 1. Here, I have the 3 as my base. And

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.500
I have the 3 repeated seven times, so 7 is my exponent. Nice work on that quiz.
