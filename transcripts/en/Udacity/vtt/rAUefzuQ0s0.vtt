00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We can define a pattern--let's say pattern is lit('a').

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now what is a pattern? Well, it's a function.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's no longer a tuple.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We can apply that pattern to a string and we get back the set of the remainders.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It says, yes, we were able to successfully parse off "a" off of a string,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and the remainder is a string.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We can define another pattern. Let's say pattern 2 equals plus(pat).

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Pattern 2 is also a function, and we can call pattern 2 of let's say the string of five a's followed by a b.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now we get back this set that says we can break off any number of a's

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
because we're asking for a and the plus of that and the closure of a.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
These are the possible remainders if we break off all of the a's or all but one

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or all but three, and so on.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Essentially we're doing the same computation that in the previous incarnation

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
with an interpreter we would have done with matchset(pat2, 'aaaab').

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now we don't have to do that. Now we're calling the pattern directly.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So we don't have matchset, which has to look at the pattern and figure out,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
yes, the top-level pattern is a plus and the embedded pattern is a lit.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Instead the pattern is now a composition of functions,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and each function does directly what it wants to do.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It doesn't have to look up what it should do.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In interpreter we have a way of writing patterns that describes the language

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that the patterns below to.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In a compiler there are two sets of descriptions to deal with.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
There's a description for what the patterns look like,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and then there's a description for what the compiled code looks like.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, in our case--the compiler we just built--the compile code consists of Python functions.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They're good target representations because they're so flexible.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You can combine them in lots of different ways.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You can call each other and so on.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
That's the best unit that we have in Python for building up compiled code.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
There are other possibilities.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Compilers for languages like C generate code that's the actual machine instructions

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
for the computer that you're running on,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but that's a pretty complicated process to describe a compiler

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that can go all the way down to machine instructions.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It's much easier to target Python functions.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Now there's an intermediate level where we target a virtual machine,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which has its own set of instructions, which are portable across different computers.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Java uses that, and in fact Python also uses the virtual machine approach,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
although it's a little bit more complicated to deal with.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
But it is a possibility, and we won't cover it in this class, but I want you to be aware of the possibility.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Here is what the so-called byte code from the Python virtual machine looks like.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I've loaded the module dis for disassemble and dis.dis takes a function as input

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and tells me what all the instructions are in that function.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Here's a function that takes the square root of x-squared plus y-squared.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This is how Python executes that.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I loads the square root function.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It loads the x and the 2, and then does a binary power,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
loads the y and the 2, does a binary power,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
adds the first two things off the top of the stack,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and then calls the function, which is the square root function with that value, and then returns it.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This is a possible target language, but much more complicated to deal with this type of code

00:03:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
than to deal with composition of functions.
