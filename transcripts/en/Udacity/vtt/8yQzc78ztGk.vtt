00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.510
Good morning, or
whatever time it is by you.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.370
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.750
This our last, general unit on for
Computer Vision.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.340
And it's actually we're
going to talk about what's

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.760
probably the most remarkable
vision system in the world.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.540
Namely the human vision system.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.210
And that's just not me being sort of
arrogant about us, us as a species.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.580
But really, we really do have a
remarkably well developed visual system.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.330
We'll talk about sort of how much of the
brain that makes use of it especially at

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.980
high level kinds of structures.
