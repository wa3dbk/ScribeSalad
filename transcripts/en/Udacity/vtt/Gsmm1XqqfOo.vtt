00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.067
Ideally, we want to draw the blue object first, then the red, then the green.

00:00:05.068 --> 00:00:08.546
The yellow filter is behind the blue object and should have no effect. For this

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:11.606
first answer, since we aren't given the alpha values of the green and red

00:00:11.606 --> 00:00:15.796
filters, we don't know how this affects our draw order. The red or green object

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:21.500
may draw first. We can also rule out this last answer for the same reason. We

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.340
don't know the intensity or even how intensity is defined so we can't use this

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.598
as a way to solve the problem. The second answer works well for the green and

00:00:29.598 --> 00:00:34.102
red filter, but falls apart on the yellow filter. With the z-buffer off, the

00:00:34.102 --> 00:00:38.160
yellow filter would be drawn on top of the blue object filtering it. This is

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.320
clearly incorrect. This leaves the third answer, which is correct. This answer

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.848
is similar to the second answer and that the Painter's algorithm also sorts

00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:51.820
objects from back to front. However, this time, with the z-buffer on, the yellow

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.052
filter is properly hidden by the blue object. The red filter is rendered next

00:00:57.052 --> 00:00:59.993
and blended, then the green is added in on top.
