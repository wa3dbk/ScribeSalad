00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.510
So with hiring it can be a mixed bag.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.470
You could randomly reach out to
a bunch of different companies that

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.780
will sell you databases of people who
are prospectively looking for jobs and

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.560
you can sit down and rifle through
a couple of thousand resumes.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.800
Done that, not so fun.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.970
Or you can take advantage of your
existing social networks and

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.060
I don't mean just jumping on Facebook
and saying hey, we're hiring..

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.620
I mean press the flesh,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.496
who do you know that is talented within
a specific skill set you're looking for?

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:30.770
You know people or
you know people who know people and

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.140
reaching out through that
network is actually really,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.020
really powerful in being able
to hire the right talent and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.770
temperament within your company because
doing otherwise is kind of toxic.
