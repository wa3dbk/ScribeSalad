00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.010
Now let's do an exercise together. So consider the sentence, Bill shot Bob.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.390
Once again, shot is a verb here, that does not quite map internal [UNKNOWN]

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.920
primitive actions clearly, cleanly. So perhaps there is an implied action here.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.020
So first write down the sentence in terms of a primitive action,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.020
then write down the frame from this primitive action so fill the slots.
