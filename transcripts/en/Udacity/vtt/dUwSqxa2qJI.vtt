00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.090
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So Matt, you're telling me that we have over 3 billion letters or nucleotides

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.440
in each one of our cells. But how does this DNA actually make who we are?

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.768
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, it's a very good question and it's kind of hard to conceive that so much

00:00:10.768 --> 00:00:15.530
information can fit in such a small space. It's important to recognize that we

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.910
call the total amount of genetic information your genome. And within

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.870
everybody's genome, there are segments called genes that code for something,

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.800
typically proteins.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.610
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, what do you mean by coding for proteins though?

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.418
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Proteins are a large part of what makes up who we are. So the physical stuff

00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:36.830
like the, the flesh, the skin, the hair. When you look at another person, who

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.822
they are is coded for by these genes, which are segments of their genome. Now,

00:00:42.822 --> 00:00:47.082
genes only make up 2% of the human genome.

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:49.691
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, then what's going on with the other 98%?

00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:53.722
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, that other 98% is still very important. Now, a large part of it we know

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:57.861
regulates that 2%. It determines how those genes are turned on and off at the

00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:02.999
right time, and the right place. And there is also another bit of that 98% that

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:07.206
we don't know what's going on yet. And we're actively researching that and

00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:08.730
learning more every day.
