00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Norvig] We're in this range where we might be done but we're not quite sure.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Our computers can do about a billion instructions per second

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
or so on a good second--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that is, one where they're not wasting part of the second with a page fault or a cache miss.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If the answer had turned out to be in the millions, we could say, "Oh, great. We're done."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If it had turned out to be in the trillions, we could say, "It's totally infeasible."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"We need a better solution."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But if it's somewhere in the middle with the billions,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
then we're not quite sure.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We better try to refine the result a little bit to tell if this brute force approach is going to work.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And think of the space of solutions in terms of execution time as like a contour map.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And here deep down in the valley where there's only millions of computations needed,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
millions of instructions needed to complete the answer, then we're really happy

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because we know that's going to go really fast.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And outside of the happy valley there are these high peaks

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
where we have trillions of computations needed,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and there we're going to be sad.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If we're stuck out in these domains,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
we're going to have to somehow find a path back in

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
because we can't just go ahead and calculate when we're out at the trillions.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And in the middle here where we need billions of instructions to complete our computation,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
then we're not quite sure.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So maybe we're happy here and we can stay in this domain.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Maybe we want to find our path through the wilderness back into the happy valley.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It depends on the problem.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And we're going to try to look at problems in terms of this space,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
try to find our way back in, but know when to stop when we've got close enough.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now let's keep thinking about what it means to do an assignment.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Try to get just a little bit more concrete about it.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If we want to assign red to house number 1,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
let's think about the ways in which we could implement that.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Here's 1 possibility where we say we're going to have an array of houses.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We take number 1 and we add red to its set of properties.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
That means that each house is represented as a set.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Here's another possibility where we take house number 1,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
we set its color property equal to red.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Here each house would have to be represented as a user-defined custom class

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
which had properties for color and nationality and so on.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Here's a third possibility.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We have a variable called red,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and we just assign that the number 1.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So here we were assigning properties to houses,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and in this one we're assigning houses to properties.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I want you to check all the approaches that you think would be reasonable designs

00:02:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
for implementing assignment.
