00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.367
We've simplified square roots and cube roots, so let's try some more higher

00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:07.752
order roots. When simplifying higher order roots, we want to look for a factor

00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:12.888
that has an exponent or power, equal to the index of the root. So this means

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:17.360
that we need to find a factor of 40, that appears three times, or has a power

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.650
of 3. If we have a 4th root, then we need to find a factor that appears four

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.170
times. Or has the power of 4 in order to remove that factor from the radical.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.168
So you try simplifying each of these. Write your answer in each of these boxes

00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:34.273
and be sure to use the apropriate index for the roots.
