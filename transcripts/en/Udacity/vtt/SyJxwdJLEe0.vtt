00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.400
As we said at the end of the previous lesson, black-box testing is

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.230
the testing of the software when we look at it as a black box,

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.110
as a closed box, without looking at it inside, without looking at the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.750
code. And there are several advantages in

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.680
using black-box testing. So let me recap

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.590
those advantages, some of which we already mentioned, and let me also expand

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.220
on that a little bit. The first advantage of when I mentioned is that

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.760
black box focuses on the domain, on the input domain of the software. And

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.750
as such, we can use it to make sure that we are actually covering

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.400
this domain, that we are actually covering the important behaviors of

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.200
the software. A second advantage is that black box testing does not

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.402
need the code. What that means is that you can perform early

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.801
test design. So you can start designing and writing your test cases,

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:41.423
even before writing your code, so that when the code is

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:44.520
ready, we can test it right away. And that helps prevent a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.054
problem that is very typical in real life software development, which is

00:00:48.054 --> 00:00:50.790
getting an idea of the project and having no time to create

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.040
the tests. In this way, we already have the tests, so

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.170
we just have to run them. Another advantage is that black-box testing

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.530
can catch logic defects, because it focuses on the description of what

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.440
the software should do, and therefore on its logic. If we derive

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.250
test cases from such description, then we can catch these kind of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.510
problems. And finally, black-box testing is

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.900
applicable at all granularity levels, which

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.490
means that we can use black-box testing in unit testing, integration testing,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.290
system testing, and so on. We can use it at all levels.
