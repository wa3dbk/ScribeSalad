00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.780
Another natural question can be, can processes interact?

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.380
And the simple answer to this is yes.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.860
An operating system must provide mechanisms to allow processes to

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.550
interact with one another.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.780
And today in fact, more and

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.840
more of the applications we see are actually structured as multiple processes.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.230
So these multiple processes have to be able to interact to contribute to

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.360
a common goal of a more complex multi-process application.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.150
For instance, here's an example of a web application consisting of

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.320
two processes on the same machine.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.020
The first one is the web server,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.430
the front-end, that accepts the customer request.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.010
And the second one is the backend,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.260
the database that stores customer profiles and other information.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.580
This is a very common case in many enterprise and web applications.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.360
So, how may these processes interact?

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.400
Now, before we answer that, remember that the operating systems

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.510
go through a great deal to protect and isolate processes from one another.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.620
Each of them is a separate address space.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.590
They control the amount of CPU each process gets,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.940
which memory is allocated, and accessible to each process.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.550
So these communication mechanisms that we will talk about somehow have to be

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.450
built around those protection mechanisms.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.270
These kinds of mechanisms are called inter-process communication mechanisms, or

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.130
we refer to them as IPC.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.560
The IPC mechanisms help transfer data and information from one

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.680
address space to another, while continuing to maintain the protection and

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.660
isolation that operating systems are trying to enforce.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.890
Also, different types of interactions between processes may

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.360
exhibit different properties.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.750
Periodic data exchanges, continuous stream of data flowing between the processes

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.300
or coordinated at the, to some shared single piece of information.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.980
Because of all these differences,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.560
IPC mechanisms need to provide flexibility as well as clearly performance.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.270
One mechanism that operating systems support is message passing IPC.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.530
The operating system establishes a communication channel,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.290
like a shared buffer for instance, and the processes interact with it

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.730
by writing or sending a message into that buffer.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.460
Or, reading or receiving a message from that shared communication channel.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.830
So, it's message passing because every process has to put the information that

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.920
it wants to send to the other process, explicitly in a message and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.420
then to send it to this dedicated communication channel.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.200
The benefits of this approach is that it's really the operating system who will

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.980
manage this channel, and it's the operating system that provides the exact same

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.350
APIs, the exact same system calls for writing or

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.600
sending data, and the reading or receiving data from this communication channel.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.220
The downside is the overhead.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.090
Every single piece of information that we want to pass between these two

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.630
processes we have to copy from the user space of the first

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.680
process into this channel that's sitting in the OS, in the kernel memory.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.640
And then back into the address space of the second process.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.810
The other type of IPC mechanism is what we call shared memory IPC.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.340
The way this works is the operating system establishes the shared

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.920
memory channel, and then it maps it into the address space of both processes.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.520
The processes are then allowed to directly read and write from this memory, as

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.010
if they would to any memory location that's part of their virtual address space.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.020
So the operating system is completely out of the way in this case.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.880
That in fact is the main advantage of this type of IPC.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.190
That the operating system is not in the fast path of the communication.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.830
So the processes, while they're communicating are not going to incur any kind of

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.900
overheads from the operating system.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.610
The disadvantage of this approach is because the operating system is out of

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.990
the way it no longer supports fixed and

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.210
well defined APIs how this particular shared memory region is used.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.630
For that reason, its usage sometimes becomes more error prone, or

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.690
developers simply have to re-implement code to use this

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.630
shared memory region in a correct way.
