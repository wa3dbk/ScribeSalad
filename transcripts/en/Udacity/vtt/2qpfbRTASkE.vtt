00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.640
Notice that this algorithm does n
over 2 additions at this statement.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.720
Then at this statement,
it does n over 2 minus 1 additions.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.760
And finally, the add scan operates
on a problem that's half the size.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.550
So what does that mean?

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.990
Basically, the recurrence for
the total work is this.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.420
So the work is linear in n.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.760
Before moving on to the span,
let me make a quick remark.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.720
I hid a constant in here.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.410
What's the constant?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.980
As it happens, the constant is about 2.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.700
Now that 2 is counting
only addition operations.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.860
Now this factor of two
is pretty interesting.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.890
Think about what that means for
a second.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.980
The purely sequential algorithm
only has a constant of about 1.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.390
So evidently our parallel
algorithm does twice the work.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.750
Now wearing your theory hat,
that's not a big deal.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.730
But it does raise an interesting and
more general question.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.730
Will you, in general,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.330
need to pay some sort of price
in order to get parallelism?

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.030
Okay, Voodak, enough with
the distractions, what about the span?

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.760
Now the first observation
is the recursive call,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.730
which always operates on
a sub-problem of half the size.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.790
So you'd naturally expect
about O (log n) levels.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.700
All the other operations
are data parallel.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.540
That means you can implement
them using parallel fours,

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.130
which will also have logarithmic span.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.320
Putting that together, here's what
the recurrence might look like.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.925
If you solve the recurrence
you will get O(log^2n).

00:01:28.925 --> 00:01:32.280
Again the master theorem makes
solving it quick and easy.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.560
Alternatively, you should be
able to see the log squared and

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.400
behavior intuitively.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.550
There's login span from the statements
within this function, and

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.200
that's repeated log in times.
