00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.584
For this first one, we have l 1 equals 10 log base 10 of p over b. So this is

00:00:05.584 --> 00:00:10.932
exactly the equation we have up here. If power is 2 p instead, then we need to

00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:20.308
plug 2p in place of p. So that gives us l 2 equals 10 log base 10 of 2p over b
