00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.377
Thinking way back a few lessons ago, a combination of terms that are added

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:09.118
together is an expression. A letter or symbol representing values that vary,

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:14.122
keyword vary here, is a variable. Remember, you can really see and hear the word

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:18.913
vary inside variable. So, that's just a good way to remember what the function

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:23.708
of these things is. And finally, the product of variables and numbers is a term.

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:27.865
A term is just a set of variables and constants that have been multiplied

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:31.960
together. I hope this was a good review of some of the algebraic form we've

00:00:31.972 --> 00:00:32.779
learned so far.
