00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.416
The last value printed by this loop is 2,000. This is a little bit weird,

00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:07.392
because the loop's condition says that it only runs as long as n is less than

00:00:07.392 --> 00:00:11.970
1,000. Let's hand trace this code to see how this happened. I'll track the

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.434
values of n, and what gets output. I start by setting n to two. And then I

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:22.505
check, n is less than 1,000, which is true. Two is less than 1,000. So I set n

00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:28.122
to be 10 times 2. And then I print out n. So I print out 20. Now, I'm at the

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:31.041
end of the curly braces. So I go back up to the top of the loop and check the

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:37.339
condition again. N is 20 now, which is still less than 1000. So I'm going to

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:44.041
repeat the steps inside the loop again. I'l set n to 10 times 20. So I get 200.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.950
And then I print out 200. I get to the curly brace, so I go back up to the top

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:56.476
of the loop again. 200 is less than 1,000, so we'll repeat the loop again. I'll

00:00:56.476 --> 00:01:01.302
set n to 10 times 200 over 2,000, and then print 2,000. And now I'm at the

00:01:01.302 --> 00:01:05.720
bottom of the loop, so I come back up and check the ignition. 2000 is less 1000

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.585
is no longer true. So I'm going to skip to the bottom and be done. It looks

00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:15.314
like the last thing that was printed was 2000. And we managed to print a larger

00:01:15.314 --> 00:01:19.149
value of n than 1000 because the print statement comes after we update the loop

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.779
variable. It matters when we update the n inside the body of the loop.
