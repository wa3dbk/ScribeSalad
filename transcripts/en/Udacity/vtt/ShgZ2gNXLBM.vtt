00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.376
So the world is becoming more and more mobile,

00:00:03.376 --> 00:00:07.288
and so the expectation is that the sorts of things we do with big GPU's today--

00:00:07.288 --> 00:00:11.209
maybe one day we'll see being done with something you carry in your pocket,

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.480
so where do you see GPU computing having an impact on sort of the mobile world?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.619
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well like I said, computing is just sort of everywhere,

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.100
and it's certainly coming to the mobile space.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.525
I think cell phones today are replacing our laptop PCs,

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:27.227
and there are opportunities, and there are new mobile devices.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:29.517
It's something that is always on, we're carrying it with us,

00:00:29.517 --> 00:00:32.603
we're interacting with people and friends, as well as ourselves with the device,

00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:35.404
and that's another opportunity for computing to make a difference.

00:00:35.404 --> 00:00:37.569
Camera is one area,

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:42.021
and one thing you do see is that cell phones are starting to take over the digital camera market,

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:47.355
and there are things that you can do with a digital camera, with a processor, with an interactive test screen--

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:52.248
things like computational photography and computer vision with the camera

00:00:52.248 --> 00:00:57.812
that just wants to be done on the device and really changes it from a point-and-shoot thing

00:00:57.812 --> 00:01:01.162
to a more dynamic interface to something interactive,

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:03.863
and I hope to see some really cool stuff happen there.
