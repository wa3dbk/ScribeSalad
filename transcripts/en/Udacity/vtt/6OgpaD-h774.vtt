00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.690
The thing that makes
this mean shift tracking

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.120
is essentially what the model is and
how we compare them.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.310
So, we've got this initial
area that we want to track and

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.780
we have to choose what
the model is going to be.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.660
And in mean shift what we do is
we choose a feature space that is

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.840
the quantized color space.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.360
So, what that means is that we

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.470
carve up the different RGB
values into a histogram.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.440
So it's written as a 1D histogram here,
but

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.560
it's typically a three
dimensional histogram.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.340
R, G and B.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.080
You might carve R up into four bins,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.240
G up into four bins,
B up into say four bins.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.820
That'd be how many bins together?

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.718
4 times 4 times 4?

00:00:43.718 --> 00:00:44.489
1,000,090, no.
64, okay,

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.300
in which case you have a 64 bin
histogram and at every point

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.100
within that region you take its color
and you put it in the right bin.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.970
And that would give you
your probability histogram

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.320
which you can think of as a PDF
of the color over that region.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.450
That's the representation of the region
that we're going to try to track.
