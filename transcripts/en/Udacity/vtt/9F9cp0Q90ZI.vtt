00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.330
Here's a list of the kinds of
data that must be collected.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.130
The reason for some of these should
be clear from our prior discussions.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.130
Smoking status, to help prevent
the development of chronic disease.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.790
Maintaining an active medication list,
to avoid duplicate or

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.390
inappropriate medications.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.330
Performing a drug formulary check,
to make sure the best

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.540
available medication is chosen for
each clinical situation.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.470
And maintaining a current problem list.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.370
So that each provider has
a more complete overview

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.850
of what's going on in
their patients care.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.800
Keep this list in mind,
as we later discuss meaningful use.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.410
The EHR usage requirements
placed on eligible providers.
