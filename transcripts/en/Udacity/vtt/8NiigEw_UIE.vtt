00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.946
You can also encounter thread divergence due to loops.

00:00:01.946 --> 00:00:03.569
Here's a somewhat contrived example.

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.638
We have some pre-loop code in our kernel.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:08.714
All the threads are going to do this code, and then they're going to reach this for loop.

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:11.804
And the way I've constructed it is, they're going to go through this loop

00:00:11.804 --> 00:00:13.873
a number of times equal to their thread index.

00:00:13.873 --> 00:00:16.239
So thread 0 will execute this code once.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.383
Thread 1 will execute it twice. Thread 2 will execute it 3 times and so on.

00:00:20.383 --> 00:00:25.148
And then eventually they're all going to exit the loop and proceed and do some post loop stuff.

00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:29.141
So what does this look like? Here's a bunch of threads and they're all in the same thread block.

00:00:29.141 --> 00:00:31.446
I've just color coded them so you can see what they do more easily.

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:33.989
And they're all going to be executing this pre-loop code,

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.996
and then they're going to reach the loop.

00:00:35.996 --> 00:00:42.090
So thread 0 is going to proceed into this loop code. And they just keep going.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.553
Thread 1 is going to execute the loop code, and then execute again, and keep going.

00:00:46.553 --> 00:00:52.152
Thread 2 will execute the loop code again and again, and keep going.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.790
And thread 3 will execute the loop code 4 times.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.055
So if we think about these threads a little differently in terms

00:00:57.055 --> 00:01:00.362
of what they're doing over time, the first order is executing the pre-loop code,

00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:02.756
then goes ahead and executes the loop code.

00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:04.971
And then it really just kind of sits around.

00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:08.929
Okay, it doesn't have anything to do for a while because, in the mean time,

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:13.581
thread 1 has executed the pre-loop code and then the loop code

00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:15.496
and then executes the loop code again.

00:01:15.496 --> 00:01:18.661
The 3rd thread executes the pre-loop code, the loop code,

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:22.900
the loop code, then executes the loop code again.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.128
And the final thread executes pre-loop code, and then executes the loop code 4 times.

00:01:28.143 --> 00:01:32.948
And finally, all the threads can go ahead and proceed with post-loop code.

00:01:32.948 --> 00:01:36.146
This diagram, when you draw it like this, kind of gives you a sense

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:39.607
of why loop divergence is a bad thing, why it slows you down.

00:01:39.607 --> 00:01:43.078
Because it turns out that the hardware likes to run these threads together,

00:01:43.078 --> 00:01:46.067
and as long as they're doing the same thing, as long as they're executing the same code,

00:01:46.067 --> 00:01:48.215
then it has the ability to do that.

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:53.018
But in this case, the blue thread proceeds for a while, and then, because it's not

00:01:53.018 --> 00:01:57.384
going to do the loop again, it just ends up waiting around while the other threads do so.

00:01:57.384 --> 00:02:00.478
And then the red thread waits for a little while. The green thread waits a little bit.

00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:04.752
And only the purple thread was executing, at full efficiency the whole time.

00:02:04.752 --> 00:02:07.718
And so you can imagine that if the hardware gets some

00:02:07.718 --> 00:02:10.401
efficiency out of running all 4 of these threads at the same time,

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:14.757
then that efficiency has been lost during this portion of the loop.
