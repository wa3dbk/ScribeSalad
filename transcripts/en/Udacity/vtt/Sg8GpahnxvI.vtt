00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Narrator] The question for the challenge is you're given 2 intercepted cipher texts, C1 and C2.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You can see those both below, and you know that they were both encrypted using a one time pad

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
using the same key.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
They're also both messages in standard English.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Your goal is to figure out what the 2 plain text messages were.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You can enter these in any order, and it should be clear to you that

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which one is which can't really be determined, but figure out what the 2 plain text messages

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
corresponding to the 2 intercepted cipher texts are, and I should mention that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you can assume that both messages are in English

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and were encoded using string.to.bits that maps English to sequences of bits.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm not going to provide an answer to this one,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but I'll give you a hint how to get started if you are stuck,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and that would be to try common English sequences of letters t-h-e would be a good one to try,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and assume that probably appears somewhere in at least 1 of the quotes,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and you can try t-h-e at each of the starting positions, and then assume that's in say message 1.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You're going to guess cipher text 1 is t-h-e encrypted with a key,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
then you can compute the key from this that gives you what the likely key is,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
XORing string.to.bits of t-h-e with the corresponding part of that cipher text,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and then you can XORing out the guest key from the corresponding part of message 2.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If that looks like something that might be part of an English message,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
well, then, that's a good guess, and you can work on from there

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and start expanding the letters that you've guessed to see ones that produce reasonable results for both cipher texts.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This is a fairly manual process; if you wanted to do this more automated way,

00:01:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
well, then, you'd use properties of English to automate this kind of guessing and expansion for you.
