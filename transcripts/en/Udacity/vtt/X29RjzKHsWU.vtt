00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.718
So let's try an example. Suppose we wanted to find the days between dates 2013

00:00:03.718 --> 00:00:08.686
Janurary 24, and 2013 June 29th. If we were going to do this

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:13.366
as a human we might look at a calendar. I happen to have a calendar handy and thanks to

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:17.086
my auntie in Belfast for sending me the calendar, and we could count the days

00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:22.463
using the calendar. So let's look at the calendar. We have our starting day is January 24

00:00:22.463 --> 00:00:27.581
and we might count the days between January 24. How many do we have left in

00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:32.701
January. So there would be 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days left in January. So there'd

00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:37.890
be seven days in January. Then we have, have all of February, all of February is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.209
28 days. Then we have all of March, 31 days. All of April, 30 days.

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:52.367
All of May, 31 days. And then we have June. We don't want to count all of June,

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:58.132
because we are stopping on June 29th, so we are going to add 29 days from June.

00:00:58.132 --> 00:01:03.206
And if we sum all those up we should get our answer. And as a human we know how to compute

00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:07.072
sums by entering the numbers into Google, and we get 156.
