00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.150
Let's ask one of our front-end engineers how he does the same thing.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.780
Now, he's hard at work, so I'm going to have to find some way to get

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.350
his attention and remind him that he agreed to talk with us.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.788
I think the dart gun should do the trick.

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:16.881
[NOISE].

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:17.646
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:18.470
I'm Jacques.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.310
I am the lead front-end engineer here at Udacity.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.920
And I've been with the company now for about two and a half years.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.380
And I was just going to run you through sort of how I approach a new design.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.509
So when I get something like this.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.700
Everything on the web is boxes.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.220
So I start out sort of understanding and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.110
cutting up the boxes that I'm going to use.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.260
And that starts with the big box that is your whole page.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.290
And from there I sort of split it up piece by piece and

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.550
we work from big to small.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.510
So in the first cut it's going to be there's a big box at the top here for

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.550
your head content your logo your text that kind of stuff.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.720
If you have a big box here with your image in it.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.760
You have a big box here with this footer all these footer elements.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.078
As you can see, actually, inside of the footer,

00:01:05.078 --> 00:01:09.828
there are three sort of small boxes with those image and text.

00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:14.062
And one sort of box that goes across the top of it with this featured work.

00:01:14.062 --> 00:01:18.460
And so I work from the, from the big side into the small side.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.370
And when I started out, I did this with pencil.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.550
I, you know you start drawing out here's a big box,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.810
this is going to be the header.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.480
And you can actually fill in the content later, you don't actually have to

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.060
worry about it, you can move from the big to the small.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.760
So how you're going to position this logo here,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.550
how you're going to make this text show up.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.590
You can put that off till later,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.300
those are smaller boxes, so start with the big boxes.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.230
And work down from there.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.800
So just sketch it out.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.070
And as you do this more often, you'll be able to do,

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.470
start doing it in your head.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.210
But if you're having any trouble, especially starting out, just go for a pencil.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.230
It's a great tool.
