00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.578
Values of x that are less than negative 4 do satisfy this inequality. Values of

00:00:04.578 --> 00:00:09.051
x that lie between negative 4 and 4 do not and values of x that are greater than

00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:13.323
4 do satisfy it. For this far left inevitable/g we could pick a number like

00:00:13.323 --> 00:00:17.971
negative 5. We plug that in to the left side at this inequality. We get negative

00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:22.507
5 squared which is 25. Then we compare it to the right side and yes 25 is

00:00:22.507 --> 00:00:27.522
greater than 16. Between negative 4 and 4, my favorite number would be 0. 0

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:32.179
squared is just equal to 0. But 0 is less than 16. So the numbers in this

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:37.609
interval don't satisfy this inequality. Lastly, over on the right, I'll pick 5.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.395
5 squared is 25, which is, in fact, greater than 16, like we saw before.
