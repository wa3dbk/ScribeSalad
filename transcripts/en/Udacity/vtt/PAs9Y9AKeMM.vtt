Now I'd like you to take a turn using Google's scientific calculator, just like

00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:07.378
I've been using. There's a link straight to this in the instructor comments for

00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:11.270
this video. In that calculator I'd like you to enter each of these three

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.860
numbers. When you press enter or the equal sign, what do you get? To be clear

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.819
I'd like you to type in here exactly what the calculator tells you.
