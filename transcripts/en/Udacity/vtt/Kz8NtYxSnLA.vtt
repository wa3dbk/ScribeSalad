00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.555
What you see here is an algorithm to answer our question. It's a sequence of

00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:13.370
steps. Each step is unambiguous, and so simple that a computer can execute it.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.508
The sequence of steps will terminate and give us an answer. Now, I want you to

00:00:17.508 --> 00:00:23.771
play the sequence of steps and execute the algorithm yourself. And when you're

00:00:23.771 --> 00:00:28.320
done, tell me what you computed for a total cost one and for total cost two.
