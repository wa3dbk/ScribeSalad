00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.627
Mm-hm.

00:00:01.627 --> 00:00:02.891
One second.

00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:05.909
All right.

00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:08.700
Great job generating
the last few reports.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.430
Your boss was able to use
the data you prepared for

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.880
her to identify some problems with
how the company was being run.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.630
And now business is booming.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.840
In the short amount of time
you've been learning Ruby,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.150
you've already added value at Toy City.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.600
Keep it up.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.240
She's got another project for
you though.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.330
After reviewing your reports, your boss
has decided that the inventory system

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.580
needs to be redone from the ground up.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.189
Now, she knows it's a pretty big task,
so all she's looking for

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.340
right now is a proof of concept.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.070
Show her that you can use
your new object oriented

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.430
skills to get a prototype
up off the ground.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.890
For this project you'll be creating
a way to keep track of inventory,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.510
customer data, and transactions.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.260
These are the same types of problems
you'll commonly be solving when working

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.180
on a larger scale web app.
