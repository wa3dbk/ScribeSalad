00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
The next type of partnerships might be joint business development,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.220
joint promotion of complimentary products.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.610
One might be the dominant player. The best example of this in the computer industry was Intel.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:20.390
Now, historically, chips ended up to be inside the computer that the consumer never saw at all,

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.640
and in fact, the only name on the outside of the box was the manufacturer,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.250
but Intel in 1980s changed that game.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.130
They said what if we pay PC manufacturers to put the phrase Intel Inside on the outside of the box,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.660
and what used to be just this unknown piece of silicone inside the computer

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.890
actually became a valuable brand for joint business development,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.570
joint promotion by sharing advertising dollars and sales programs.
