values are increasing by one, as we move down the list. But, what about the

00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:13.598
values of f of x? Please to complete this sentence, to say what's going on with

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:18.674
those numbers on the right side of the table. As x increases by one, f of x

00:00:18.674 --> 00:00:23.838
does one of these things by some number.
