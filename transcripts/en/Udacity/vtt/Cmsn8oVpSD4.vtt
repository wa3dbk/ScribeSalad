00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.690
Let us look at analogical retrieval more closely. Once again,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.532
we have come across this idea earlier. We did analogical retrieval in

00:00:07.532 --> 00:00:11.930
recording cases by the k nearest neighbor method. We did analogical retrieval on

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.300
a case based reasoning using two different methods, the array method and

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.570
the discrimination tree method. Here the criteria for evaluating similarity were

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.340
very clear, as we discussed earlier. [UNKNOWN] distance, same tags,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.190
as well as placement in this discrimination tree. The question now becomes,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.940
what criteria should be used to decide on the similarity between the target

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.240
problem and the source case, given that they come from different domains?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.748
On surface, there seems to be little similar between the two. None of

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:43.740
the objects are similar. None of the values of features are similar. Yet,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.390
there is a deep similarity there. We can distinguish now between superficial

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.370
similarity between two situations and deep similarity between two situations.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.590
Superficial similarity deals with features of objects or counts of objects or

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.710
objects themselves. Deep similarity deals with relationships between objects, or

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.052
sometimes relationships between relationships. Examples of this arise from

00:01:07.052 --> 00:01:10.850
the variables test with which you are already familiar. Features here refer to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.690
the size of the square, the size of the circle, or perhaps where there is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.230
a hollow square, or a solid dot. The count refers to the number of squares,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.900
or number of circles, in a particular image. Objects here refer to circles and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.250
squares and dots. Let us look at relationship between objects.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.789
Two situations are said to be deeply similar,

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.170
if the relationship between the objects is similar. As an example, a and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.510
b are similar, in that, that the dot is outside the circle here and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.250
the square is outside the circle here. A and

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.710
b are also similar in that the dot is above the circle here and the square is

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.520
above the circle here. What about relationships between relationships?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.140
Let us compare a and b. In going from A to B, the dot has disappeared, and

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.270
a square has come outside the circle, and become bigger. Now we can compare this

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.310
relationship between a and b, with some of the relationship between a c and

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.250
a b, in which too, some object might be disappearing, and

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.590
another object which may be in the center of the circle comes out of the circle.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.600
I'm sure you've come across problems like that on the variable test.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.260
This is an example of a binary relationship, a relationship between two objects.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.120
This is an example of a higher order relationship, a tertiary relationship if

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.730
you wish. This is a relationship between the relationship between objects.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.470
You might even say that these are examples of unary relationships.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.319
These are just examples of objects and their features and

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.231
counts. In general, as we go from unary relationships to binary relationships to

00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:50.129
tertiary relationships to even higher order relationships, the similarity

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.320
becomes deeper and deeper. This means that mind decides two situations to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.900
be more similar if the similarity is at the level of relationship between

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.820
objects rather simply at the level of objects or features or counts and objects.
