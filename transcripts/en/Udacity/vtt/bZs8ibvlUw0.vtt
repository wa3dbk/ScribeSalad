So this concludes our little
addendum to object recognition.

00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:07.859
And what it will do is it will let me
later talk about, well actually, it will

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.793
let me later not talk about activity
recognition being done the same way,

00:00:11.793 --> 00:00:15.968
where instead of doing it over
just images, you do it over video.

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:20.620
But code words are a very, sort of,
standard approach in computer vision

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.210
these days, and so
it's important that you know about it.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.630
So I, I went and stole some new slides
to make this just for you guys.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.600
So I hope you appreciate it.
