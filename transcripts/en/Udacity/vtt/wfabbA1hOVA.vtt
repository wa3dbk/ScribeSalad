00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.210
So are there any worse problems than undecidable ones?

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.880
Well, that kind of depends on your subjective view,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.880
but from a perspective of computer science

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.330
undecidability is the biggest and meanest monster of complexity;

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.420
for a computer, there's no worse thing than

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.160
"I can't do it."

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.320
Which is undecidability, so the answer here is no,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.330
but that also means

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.200
that you have completed your journey,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.800
which means that all that remains to be said is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.270
Congratulations for completing our Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science!

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.700
I consider this to be a rather challenging course,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.400
so you should really be proud of yourself

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.150
for having learning so many advanced concepts.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.300
You have learned about NP complete problems, some of the toughest problems

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.090
that are out there, and you have also learned how to recognize these problems,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.360
so detecting NP completeness.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.480
You have also learned how to navigate around NP completeness

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.610
using techniques such as search trees,

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.430
pre-processing, fixed parameter tractability,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.250
approximation algorithms, and other techniques

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.250
such as randomized algorithms,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.150
and finally, and this is all but trivial,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.330
you now even understand the cliffs of undecidability.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.730
I hope I've conveyed to you for many problems

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.260
that are very, very challenging to solve,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.300
digging deeper into underlying algorithms

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.230
and techniques

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.260
can really be rewarding, because not only is it fascinating,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.390
but actually, problems that to many people will seem unsolvable

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.230
can be solved using the tools that you've now learned.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.890
Theoretical Computer Science or the science of challenging problems

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.670
is a very rich and deep field

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.280
and you're no ready to dig deeper.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.980
Whether you want to dig deeper into the theory

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.210
or you want to dig deeper into writing your own algorithms

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.470
to solve nearly impossible problems,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.610
that is up to you, but in any case,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.290
I wish you all the best for that journey,

00:01:49.290 --> 99:59:59.000
and once more, congratulations for completing this course.
