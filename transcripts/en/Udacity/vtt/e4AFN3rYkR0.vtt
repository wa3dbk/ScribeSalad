00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.300
So, I will return back to my code. And here, I will attempt to make

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.000
an instance of class Movie, in much the same way we did for class Turtle. I

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.340
will start by creating a new Python file. I will then Save this file, in the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.890
same folder as my previous Python file. And

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.290
I will call this new file entertainment_center.py. So,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.890
here are my two Python files that I have created

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.370
thus far. Here's the first one, where I began to

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.740
define the class Movie. It was called media.py. And here

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.810
is is the new file called entertainment_center.py. Now, here in

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.280
this new file, I will say, import media. Now notice

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.480
that this is my media file, which is where I

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.350
was beginning to define my Movie class and therefore, with

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.480
this line of code, I am telling my program, hey here,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.535
I want to use the contents of my previous Python file. Then I will go on to

00:00:56.535 --> 00:01:02.680
say toy_story is equal to media.Movie. So, you may

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.590
notice here that media is name of my previous

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.220
Python file and Movie is the name of

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.730
the class that's defined inside that file. One quick

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.510
side note here is that I did not have to create a new file. In fact, I could

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.680
have written this entire piece of code right here

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.850
in my previous file. But it is good practice to

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.840
keep the class definition in one file and to call

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.020
your class, or to use your class from another file.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.760
Okay, let's continue. So, there is one thing I

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.330
want to highlight here. Which is that this line of

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.700
code is pretty similar to how we created the turtle

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.010
brad. In both cases, I am saying, some module or

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.490
file name dot a class name. Now, the next

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.270
thing we have to do is figure out exactly what

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.330
happens when we run this line of code. One way

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.560
to do that is to remember what happened behind the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.290
scenes. When we created the turtle brad. So, let's

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.495
investigate that together. Do you remember what happens when we

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:03.360
run the following line of code? Here are some answer

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.410
choices. A function named init is called; it initializes or

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.020
creates space in memory for the new instance brad. Or, a

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.720
function named D-E-L, or del it's called, it deletes the instance brad.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.134
A function named cmp, or compare is called. It compares the instance

00:02:20.134 --> 00:02:23.910
brad to angie, or, I don't know. Tell us what you think.
