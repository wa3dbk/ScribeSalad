00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right, let's go through the possible answers together.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're definitely going to match 1368 because it's in the language of this regular expression.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's 4 copies of 0-9 together.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
By default, the value of the token, that is, when it comes into us,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
it's just the string 1368.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But we're going to convert it to an integer

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
using this cast or conversion here,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so at the end of the day, it's going to be 1368.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's not going to be the string 1368

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because we have this special conversion.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's not going to be the string 1 because the maximal munch rule

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
means that we're not going to match just one.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We match all 4 digits.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Similarly, it's not going to be the integer 1 because we match 1368.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's also not going to be the empty string.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We definitely match 1368,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and 1368 is a good number to match.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That's the approximate year when the Ming Dynasty started.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
They featured a strong central government in China,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but perhaps they're best known because most of the Great Wall

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that we can see was either built or repaired during the Ming Dynasty.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This is my Great Wall sketch.

00:01:07.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You can tell it's the Great Wall because it's got a label that says "Great Wall."
