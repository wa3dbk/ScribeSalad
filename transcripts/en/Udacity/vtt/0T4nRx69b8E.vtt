00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.730
So, what is the big picture with

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.710
virtualization? In either of the two approaches that

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.530
I mentioned, whether it is full virtualization or

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.090
parel virtualization, we have to virtualize, the hardware

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.530
resources and make them available safely to

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.330
the operating systems that are running on top

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.300
of the hypervisor. And when we talk about

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.560
hardware resources, we're talking about the memory hierarchy,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.440
the CPU, and the devices that are there

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.580
in the hardware platform. How to virtualize them

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.040
and make them available in a transparent manner

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.750
for use by the operating systems that live above

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.050
the hypervisor? And how do we affect? Data

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.760
and control transfer between the guest operating systems

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.780
and the hyper-visor. So these are all the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.870
questions that we will be digging deeper into in

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.840
this course module. That wraps up the basic introduction to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.390
virtualization technology And now it is time to roll up

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.410
our sleeves and look deeper into the nuts and bolts

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.130
of virtualizing the different hardware elements in the hypervisor. .
