00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.363
The rule that we just came up with in the last quiz for figuring out graphically

00:00:04.363 --> 00:00:08.404
whether or not a curve is a function is called the vertical line test. So

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:12.992
remember, according to the vertical line test, we can tell that a curve is a

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:17.210
function if there is no vertical line that we can draw anywhere on the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.276
coordinate plane that intersects that curve at more than one point. So, using

00:00:22.276 --> 00:00:26.765
your newfound understanding of the vertical line test, which of the five curves

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:31.002
over here are functions? So, please check off as many as you think are, in fact,

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:31.647
functions.
