00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.000
In this session,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.670
we're going to learn how to utilize
existing classes through inheritance.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.740
Inheritance allows us to reuse or
inherit methods, properties, and other

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.830
characteristics from existing classes,
so that we don't repeat our selves.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.010
This keeps the code we write clean and
maintainable.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.630
Let's get started.
