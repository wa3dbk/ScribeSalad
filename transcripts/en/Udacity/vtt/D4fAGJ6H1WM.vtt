00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.068
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:05.060
We have Dhruv here with us today and
he's a product engineer at Udacity.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.490
So Dhruv, tell us the story about how
you learned your first framework.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.088
&gt;&gt; The first framework I used was
in college, it was Ruby on Rails.

00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:16.015
And people will usually teach you
frameworks as a starting point into

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:20.553
building your first application because
it takes away a lot of the decisions and

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.230
complexities for you.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.300
So you can just jump into a framework,
learn it,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.040
and ideally get building your first
application in a couple days.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.008
So that was the first
general framework I used.

00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.618
The first front-end specific
framework I used was Angular.

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:39.310
I used it in a summer
internship in my senior year.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.190
And again, at the time I thought it
was like nothing I'd ever seen, but

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.682
it helped me get moving quickly
into routing, building views,

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:51.690
and generally getting the fundamental
design patterns of the web quickly.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.770
&gt;&gt; So now that you're
working with one framework,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.290
how difficult was it to
switch to a new framework?

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.180
&gt;&gt; The truth is a lot of
these frameworks come from

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.780
radically different paradigms.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.830
So Angular and React have very
different philosophies about things.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.030
But a lot of them do
share commonalities.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.410
So for instance,
if you go between Angular and

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.010
Ember, both are generally MVC
frameworks, and if you know one,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.750
you get the guiding principles or
the idea behind the others.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.440
A framework like React comes at
it from a very different way.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.200
But knowing another framework helps you
evaluate another framework you're using.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.720
So knowing Angular helped me understand
a lot more about why React is useful,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.370
what were the guiding philosophies
that made it unique and

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.520
appealing to developers, and
understanding the trade-offs

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.510
that came with it compared to
a system like Angular or Ember.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.276
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
if you are learning frameworks,

00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:47.128
you shouldn't just find your first
one and stick with that for life.

00:01:47.128 --> 00:01:50.776
You should experience the other ones,
build something with them, see what

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:54.548
are the needs of your application, and
then pick the best framework for that.

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:56.890
&gt;&gt; Definitely,
I think that's a very good answer.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.390
There are some frameworks
that are fairly impractical,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.610
but I learned them anyways because they,
again,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.330
teach you philosophies and ideas of
approaching programming that are unique.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.019
So in particular I checked out Elm lang,

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.777
which is a very functional approach
to doing front-end programming.

00:02:12.777 --> 00:02:14.589
I've looked at ClojureScript a lot,

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.940
again, another very functional
perspective to doing programming.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.580
And these have all affected how I
view the frameworks I use today.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.510
And in addition to just
looking at what works for

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.010
you at this given point in time,

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.550
it's also worth looking at what the
general community is working towards.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.300
Because if you work with the community,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.830
you're going to get a lot of tools,
a lot of resources

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.090
that you wouldn't get otherwise if
you choose a very niche framework.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.300
So there's a lot of considerations
to make, but understanding that

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.800
not all frameworks are perfect and that
every framework might not be perfect for

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.350
the job you're choosing is
a very good place to start.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.850
&gt;&gt; So what is some advice that you would
give to students that are looking to

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.550
dive into the world of frameworks?

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.460
&gt;&gt; To start by not looking at the
fine-grain details of how to implement

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.720
X, Y, or Z in a framework, although
you'll have to do that in your app.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.970
But at some point,
to take a step back and try and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.870
figure out what's the philosophy
of this framework.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.740
A framework is essentially some
really smart people somewhere have

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.660
designed this intricate system to
help you accomplish something.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.523
There's a lot to learn in just
looking at how it was designed, and

00:03:16.523 --> 00:03:19.346
you can reuse a lot of those
concepts in future things you build.

00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:23.618
So the first thing is just looking at
the framework, understanding it, and

00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:27.108
understanding how it was created or
what the decisions were.

00:03:27.108 --> 00:03:29.960
Frameworks are always going to be good
at some things and bad at some things.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.020
Understanding those trade-offs and
learning to appreciate those.
