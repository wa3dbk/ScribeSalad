00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.083
Let's try another rational function. We'll look for both the horizontal and the

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:09.186
vertical asymptotes. But let's just start out with the vertical. The function

00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:13.518
I'd like us to look at is f of x equals 8x squared minus 1 over 4x squared

00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:18.635
minus 9. Please write the vertical asymptotes in this box, separating the

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:20.290
equations by commas.
