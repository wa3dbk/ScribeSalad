00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
So the times you see are two given vertices are connected.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:09.610
Well, if we can access every element of the adjacency matrix in constant time,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.200
well then we can just check that given element in the matrix in constant time.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.110
Similarly, the time required to add and edge between two vertices--

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.670
well, we can access that element in constant time and then just change it from 0 to 1

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.310
that's constant time, and similarly, we can change from 1 to 0 to remove an edge

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.060
between two vertices.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.810
Now, the time to find the degree of a vertex.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.570
It's a little bit harder to find the degree of a vertex where the degree is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.790
the number of vertices that are connected to it.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.370
In order to find all the vertices that are connected to a given vertex, well, we have to go down

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.100
that row or that column one by one.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.220
Since we have to do this n times, well this is what it end at least.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.930
Now, these questions are somewhat tricky and memory required to represent a graph

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.540
with O(n) edges as an adjacency matrix and O(n²) edges as an adjacency matrix.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.590
This is a bit of a trick question. If we have n vertices, then we have an n x n,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.430
which is n² total elements.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.440
So we're going to need n² memory slots to put each of those elements in.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:29.630
You can pare that down a little bit if you're really clever, but if any of adjacency matrix approach,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.770
then the memory required isn't really a function of the number of edges

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.180
so much as it is the number of vertices.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.840
So we want to go ahead and put n² for both of those.
