00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.689
So I quickly want to sort of introduce
how virtualization actually helps us

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.620
in limiting the damage that can
be caused by a compromised or

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.070
hacked operating system.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.240
Okay, we said, maybe you want to run
more than one operating system on

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.760
the same underlying hardware but this is
going to help us with security as well.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.590
So, limiting the damage of
a hacked operating system.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.860
Let's see, how can we do that
when we have virtualization?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.000
Okay, the way we do that is we change
the picture where we had the hardware

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.500
and the operating system,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.320
well we introduce something between
the hardware and the operating system.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.920
And that is called a Hypervisor.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.501
On top of the Hypervisor, we support
what is called virtual machines.

00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:44.459
And these virtual machines have
their own operating system.

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:46.500
It's called the guest operating system.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.390
And the guest operating
system then can support

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.450
a number of applications that
run within that virtual machine.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.880
So if you, we look at our earlier
picture, we have the hardware,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.940
then we have the Hypervisor,
then we have this virtual machines.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.600
So this is the OS here and
the application here.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.340
Compromise of an OS here only
affects these applications in

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.210
this virtual machine.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.680
It doesn't do anything to
the application that may be running

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.610
in this different virtual machine.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.740
With the same operating system or
a different operating system.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.170
What we really have is isolation
between virtual machines.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.580
So earlier,
we had isolation between processes or

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.990
applications, and they all shared
the same operating system.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.120
Now we have isolation between
different virtual machines.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.710
Each has it's own operating system or
guest operating system.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.180
So I can do my package in
one virtual machine while

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.430
browsing potentially dangerous places on
the web in a different virtual machine.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.850
Anything bad that happens in the second
virtual machine, or VM2, should not

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.560
affect your tax stuff that you're
doing in your first virtual machine.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.270
So the tested computed base
really here is the Hypervisor.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.990
In the picture that we had before
where we had the hardware and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.770
the trusted computing base and
then the application.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.780
It changes with virtualization
where we have the hardware,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.180
Hypervisor, and
then the virtual machines and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.130
those virtual machines have
their own operating system.
