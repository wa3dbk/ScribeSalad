00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.242
Remember that square root signs are the same as exponents of 1 half. So, you

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:08.458
need to take the entire quantity 2x plus 4 place it in parenthesis and then,

00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:12.810
just outside the parenthesis put a power of 1 over 2, and we didn't do anything

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.872
to change the right hand side of the equation at all.
