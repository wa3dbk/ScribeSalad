00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
As you'll remember from the last unit, a decision problem states a problem in a way

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.450
that the answer is either yes or no.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.980
It cannot be the first one, because what is the shortest tour

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.480
would actually have to specify that tour.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.850
It can also not be the third one, because given a graph with distances,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.250
how long is the shortest tour, that asks for a number.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.220
The only yes/no question is the second one here.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.790
In order to state shortest tour as a decision problem, we have the graph wtih distances

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.460
as an input and a number d, in order to be able to ask if there is a tour of length at most d.

00:00:33.460 --> 99:59:59.000
This one here is correct.
