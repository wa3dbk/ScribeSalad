00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.340
Now that we have illustrated hierarchical planning, what does it tell us about

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.890
intelligence? Intelligent agents, both cognitive and artificial, constantly

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.570
faced with large, complex problems. The problem spaces corresponding to these

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.830
problems often have [INAUDIBLE] explosion of states in them. Intelligent agents

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.140
address these complex problems by thinking at multiple levels of abstraction. So

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.940
that at any one level of abstraction, the problem appears small and

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.950
simple. In order to be able to reason at these multiple levels of abstraction,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.270
we need knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction. In this case,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.260
there was knowledge not only at the level of move operations, but

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.040
also the level of macro operations, like unstack and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.160
stack ascending. And perhaps even higher level macro operations, like sort.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.780
This goes back to the fundamental notion of knowledge based AI. Intelligent

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.730
agents use knowledge in order to be able to tackle hard, complex problems.
