00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In our case, there is a single assertion, which could be placed in the loop body

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to catch these kinds of errors, and actually an assertion which could remain in the code.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It is an assertion that captures the relationship between the variables tag.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What is the correct assertion? Is it assert quote and not tag? Or quote or not tag?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Or tag or not quote? Or is it assert tag and not quote?
