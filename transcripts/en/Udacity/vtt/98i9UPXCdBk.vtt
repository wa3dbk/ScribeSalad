00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.070
I want you to calculate how
wide the viewport is for

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.920
the four devices you see here.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.490
And remember, the viewport width
is generally calculated by

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.800
dividing the number of physical pixels,
by the device pixel ratio.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.480
Type your boxes into the answers here.
