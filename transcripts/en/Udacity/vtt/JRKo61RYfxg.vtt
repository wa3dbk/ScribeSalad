Nice work on functions up to this point. Now let's try this thing called the

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:08.757
composition of functions. The composition of a function is when we use two or

00:00:08.757 --> 00:00:16.315
more functions together. The notation looks like this, f of g of x. Notice that

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:22.270
this symbol is not a multiplication sign. It's a small open circle, that means

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.915
the composite of g functions. It kind of looks like fog. But we really read

00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:34.790
this as f of g of x. To see what's happening here, let's look at some function

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.508
machines. F of x will be a function that triples a number and g of x will be a

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:47.884
function that adds 5 a number. So, we're going to start by finding the f of g

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:54.195
of 3. What this means is, we want to find the output of g of 3 and use that as

00:00:54.195 --> 00:01:01.454
the input for f of x. In other words, we'll get some output here for plugging

00:01:01.454 --> 00:01:06.835
in 3 into g. Then we'll take this output, and plug it into f to get a new

00:01:06.835 --> 00:01:14.448
output. So, we know g of 3, we simply take 3 and plug it in for x. So g of 3

00:01:14.448 --> 00:01:21.945
would equal 8. So, now just really want to find the f of 8. We take the output

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:27.496
of g of 3, and plug that into f, so letting x equal 8 for this function, we'll

00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:36.561
have 3 times 8 which equals 24. This is f of g of 3. Knowing this, what do you

00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:40.970
think would be f of g of 5? Enter that number here.
