00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.596
You again have to modify the x and y values computed. By multiplying the

00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:09.018
original point by the radius, this expands or contracts these points around the

00:00:09.018 --> 00:00:13.266
origin. After that, you add the location to move the whole polygon elsewhere,

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:17.333
same as before. This gives you a little taste of the unit on transforms, where

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.553
we will be talking about these sorts of operations in depth.
