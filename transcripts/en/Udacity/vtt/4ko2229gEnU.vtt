00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.370
Here were the three answers. Great work if you got at least two of these

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.934
correct. let's see how we can simplify each one. The quickest way to simplify

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:12.965
the square root of 80, is to rewrite 80 as 16 times 5. We take the square root

00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:16.155
of 16, which is 4, and then we leave the 5 inside of the radical, since we

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:20.820
can't simplify it. It's not a perfect square. You might of thought to do this

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.170
as well. You might of said 80 equals 8 times 10, and then you might of split 8

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.770
into 4 times 2 and 10 into 2 times 5. We know 2 times 2 equals 4 so we really

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.153
have a group of two 4s. Because we have two 4s, and our index is a 2 since

00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:42.372
we're taking a square root. We can pull one 4 out in front of the radical. So

00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:47.194
we have 4 times the square root of 5. For 120, we split this number up into 12

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:53.510
times 10, and then 3 times 4 times 2 times 5. The only perfect square factor in

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.685
this radical is the 4. So we take the square root of 4, which gives us 2. The

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:02.340
other factors are not perfect squares. So they need to stay within the radical.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.740
So we have 3 times 2 which is 6. Times five which equals 30. For this last week

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.374
and split of 180 into 10 times 18. We split up the 10 into 5 times 2 and the 18

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:19.840
into 2 times 9. Notice that we have a perfect square of 9 here, also we have a

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.711
perfect square of 4. We use our product rule, to split up this one radical into

00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:28.769
the multiplication of three radicals. We know the square root of 4 is 2 and the

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:33.580
square root of 9 equals 3. And finally, we multiply 3 times 2 which equals 6

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.158
which is multiplied by the square root of 5, since we can't simplify it. This

00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:42.888
was perhaps the longer way to do the problem. Notice that we have two smaller

00:01:42.888 --> 00:01:48.758
perfect squares here. Well if we multiply these together we would get 36. So we

00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:55.590
really know that 180 is the same thing as 5 times 36. So instead, if we rewrote

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.930
180 as 5 times 36, we could have 6 times the square root of 5, since the square

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.500
root of 36 equals 6. We can get to this answer more quickly, by splitting up

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.639
our original radicand into the largest product of a perfect square and another

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.679
factor. By using the largest perfect square here, we get directly to the

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:15.933
answer.
