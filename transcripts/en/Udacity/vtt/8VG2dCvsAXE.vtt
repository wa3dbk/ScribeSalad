00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.705
So, here's the next question I want to ask

00:00:01.705 --> 00:00:05.890
you, simple true or false question. Does it make sense

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.530
to repeat an attribute along any given path in

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.910
the tree? So, if you we pick some attribute like

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.230
A, should we ever ask a question about A

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.880
again? Now, I mean something very specific about, by that.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.590
I mean, down a particular path of the tree,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.690
not just anywhere else in the tree. So, in particular,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.000
I mean this. So, I ask a question about A, then

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.870
I ask a question about B, and then I ask a

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.810
question about A again. That's the question I'm asking. Not whether

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.890
A might appear more than once in the tree. So, for example,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.470
you might have been the case where A shows up more

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.440
than once in the tree, but not along the same path.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.140
So, in the second case over here, A shows up more

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.295
than once, but they really don't really have anything to do with

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:54.200
one another because once you've answered B, you will only ever

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.080
ask the question about A once. So, my question to you is,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.040
does it make sense to repeat A more than once along

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.750
a particular path in the tree? Yes or no? Answer the question.
