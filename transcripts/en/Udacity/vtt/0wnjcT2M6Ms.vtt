00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.680
To use Memcache using the Java native API, first

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.610
you get the Memcache service. You'll need to import the

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.710
Memcache service and the Memcache service factory into your

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.810
project and then you just use the getMemcacheService method on

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.570
the factory to get the Memcache service. Then to

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.700
put an entry into Memcache, you need a key. And

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.430
of course, a value to put and you just

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.420
call the put method. And to get the value out

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.800
of memcache, you need to know the key and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.450
you just call the get method on memcacheService. If there

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.080
is no value in memcache with that key then null

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.710
is returned. Setting the announcement is something that we don't

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.670
want to expose through end points. We don't want other

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.970
people to be able to set the announcements for our

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.140
application. So we'll use a servlet in this case and

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.440
protect the URL for the servlet so that the app

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.770
itself can set the announcement but no one else can. Actually developers for the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.330
application will be able to set the announcement but no one else will. So

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.990
you see here I implemented set announcement as a serve let.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.435
Extends HttpServlet and I implements the doGet method. So here's

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:15.350
where I imported the MemcacheService and the MemcacheServiceFactory.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.100
Here's where I get the MemcacheService and here's where I

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.050
put the value into memcache. Notice that this method doesn't

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.120
set the response so we set the response status to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.540
204 which means that no response is expected. So if

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.600
you come here in the browser just stay on the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.540
same page where you are. All this method does is

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.140
generate the announcement and save it in the memcache, it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.510
doesn't return it. When you use servlet's in an app

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.170
engine application you need to configure them in web.xml.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.540
So here's some mapping I added to web.xml for

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.080
the get announcement servlet. So here the servlet name

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.180
is set announcement servlet. And then here is the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.020
class that implements the servlet and notice that I

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.410
put it in the servlet package. And then you

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.190
map the servlet name to the URL where it

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.640
gets called. So in this case, we're going to call

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.440
the servlet by going to crons/setannouncement. I also

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.550
defined a security constraint for my servlet because

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.130
I want to make sure that no body

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.210
except developers for this application can trigger the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.500
servlet. How to find the resource name and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.900
then the URL pattern that I'm protecting. Here

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.310
I've specifically protected /crons/setannouncement or I could just

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.420
protect everything under the slash crons path and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.910
to specify the only admin that is developers of the application can trigger this

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.520
url. I set the role name to be admin. Right, wanted it so that any

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.910
logged in user could trigger it and all I would do is specify the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.220
role name as asterisks but I don't.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.270
I definitely want to restrict access to admins.
