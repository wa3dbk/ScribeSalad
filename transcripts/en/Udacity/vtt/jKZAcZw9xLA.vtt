00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.710
Let's continue looking at some other variables so we can better

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.080
understand our users in our sample data set. This time I'm going

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.560
to examine the distribution of tenure, or how many days someone has

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.910
been using Facebook. I'm also going to start introducing color to jazz

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.790
up our plots a little bit. To do that I'm going to

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.400
use the color and the fill parameter. Now, I'm not going to explain

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.610
this code in detail. Check out the instructor notes for an explanation

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.440
of this code. There's also a link to ggplot's themes to learn

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.960
about all the different adjustments besides color that you can make. Now,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.410
if this code has thrown you for a loop, I don't want

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.790
you to focus on it too much, you can really just ignore

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.240
it. I'll typically include it as the second line of parameters inside of

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.070
qplot. Running this code, you can see we get a nice histogram.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.990
And again, here the histogram has defaulted to the automatic bin width. I'm

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.300
going to make one last adjustment and set it for ourselves. By setting

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.640
the bin width equal to 30, we can see we get a finer

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.870
view of the distribution. Let's see if you have

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.270
a handle on histograms and bin width. We're going to see

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.370
if you can change the distribution in this next

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.350
programming exercise. In it, you're going to be creating a histogram

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.090
of tenured that's measured in years, rather than in

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.883
days. You'll also want to think about an appropriate bin

00:01:05.883 --> 00:01:08.590
width for the data. 30 here makes sense, since

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.080
I'm measuring days, and 30 days is about a month.
