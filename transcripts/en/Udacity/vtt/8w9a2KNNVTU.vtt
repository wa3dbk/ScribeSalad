00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.540
The fourth of Kruchtens' views is the physical view, and

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.380
this is very close to the previous one.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.840
Here however we are concerned with how the processes are allocated

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.360
to the various execution units.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.180
And we can use the deployment diagram that we just saw, or

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.860
we can use a sequence diagram here.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.400
Here, as a reminder, is a sequence diagram.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.960
The columns correspond to objects,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.280
which could be running on separate processors.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.790
Recall that objects are like classes, except the names are underlined and

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.750
there's usually a colon separating the name from the class name.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.710
Going down a column corresponds to the passage of time.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.180
And the lines that cross it indicate messages being sent.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.230
So here we have the, the coordination of three

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.680
particular processes dealing with the handling of a transaction.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.230
Collaboration diagrams had the same content as in sequence diagrams, but

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.890
they're laid out differently.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.319
Here's the corresponding collaboration diagram for

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.430
the previous sequence diagram.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.270
Same objects, same messages.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.960
The numbers indicate the orders in which the messages are sent.
