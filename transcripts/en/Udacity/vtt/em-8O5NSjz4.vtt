00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.562
To start our problem, we want to multiply the numerator and denominator by the

00:00:03.562 --> 00:00:09.640
conjugate of this denominator. The conjugate of root 2 plus root 5, is root 2

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.504
minus root 5. We distribute this 6 to each of these terms to get 6 root 2 minus

00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:19.830
6 root 5. Next, we use our difference of squares factoring pattern, to do a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.500
squared minus b squared. We square root 2 to get 2 and we square root 5 to get

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.852
5. Next we subtract inner denominator to get a denominator of negative 3, and

00:00:28.852 --> 00:00:34.240
here's where we want to be careful. When we simplify we can divide negative 3

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.178
into this term and into this term, 6 divided by negative 3 is negative 2, and

00:00:38.178 --> 00:00:44.873
negative 6 divided by negative 3 is positive 2. This is how we get our answer

00:00:44.873 --> 00:00:49.846
of negative 2 root 2, plus 2 root 5. Another way the think about it is to

00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:54.202
factor a negative 3 from each of these terms. If we factor a negative 3 from

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:58.952
this first term, we'll be left with negative 2 times root 2. And we factor a

00:00:58.952 --> 00:01:03.690
negative 3 from this term we'll be left with 2 root 5. We can check this really

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.512
quickly by distributing this negative 3 to each of these terms. We'll wind up

00:01:07.512 --> 00:01:11.524
with our numerator from before. Now that we have a common factor of negative 3

00:01:11.524 --> 00:01:15.974
in the numerator and in the denominator we can simplify. These reduce to 1

00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:21.197
which leaves us with just our numerator, negative 2 root 2 plus 2 root 5. And

00:01:21.197 --> 00:01:24.444
now there are a couple of ways to write this answer. You could have factored a

00:01:24.444 --> 00:01:29.000
negative 2 out to get this answer or you could have factored a positive 2 out.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.668
Either of these is correct. Nice algebraic thinking if you got any of these

00:01:33.668 --> 00:01:34.893
answers.
