Here is my answer. There is a lot of variation in exactly how you want the grammar to look.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But I just went through the grammar on the json.org webpage,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
started to write it down, made sure I wrote it in the correct order.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They had things like members goes to pair or pair, members,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and I had to make sure to put the longer element first,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because that's the way our parser works.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Other than that, it was straightforward.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I abbreviated a little bit.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I didn't get into spelling out the individual digits.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I kind of stuck them together into longer regular expressions

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to take advantage of that rather than break it out all the way.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But either way you did it, if you get it to parse, you've done the job and congratulations.
