00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.440
As with described in Birrell condition variables are synchronization constructs

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.140
which allow block threads to be notified once a specific condition occurs.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.200
Birrell proposed the condition as condition variable abstraction as well as

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.490
three operations.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.742
Weight, signal, and broadcast that can be performed on conditioned variables.

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:24.160
In pthreads condition variables are represented via

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.390
the designated condition variable data type.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.100
The remaining operations align really well with Birrell's mechanisms.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.110
For instance, for weight,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.470
pthread has a pthread condition weight that takes two arguments,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.830
a condition variable and a mutex, just like what we saw in Birrell's weight.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.160
The semantics of this operation is also identical to Birrell's wait.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.170
A thread that's entering the wait operation, a thread that must wait,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.510
will automatically release the mutex and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.840
place itself on the wait queue that's associated with the condition variable.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.200
When the thread is woken up, it will automatically re-acquire the mutex before

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.540
actually exiting the wait operation.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.060
This is identical to the behavior we saw in Birrell's wait.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.480
Identical to the signal and broadcast mechanisms in Birrell, PThreads has.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.060
Pthread condition signal and pthread condition broadcast,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.210
that we can use to either notify one thread that's waiting on a condition

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.280
variable using the signal operation, or to notify all threads that are waiting

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.870
on a condition variable using the pthread condition broadcast operation.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.910
There are also some other common operations that are used in

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.170
conjunction with condition variables.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.715
These include the init and destroy functions.

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:44.090
Pthread_condition_init is pretty straight forward,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.300
you have to use this operation in order to allocate the data structure for

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.450
the condition and in order to initialize it's attributes.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.480
Like what we saw with mutexes.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.780
The attributes can further specify the behavior that

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.320
pthreads provides with conditions.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.470
For instance an example is whether or

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.008
not the conditions variable will be used only within threads that belong to

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:12.990
a single process or also shared across processes.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.670
And similar to what we saw with the mutex and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.440
threads attributes data structures.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.730
Passing null in this call will result in

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.010
the default behavior that's supported by pthreads.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.250
That happens to be that the condition variable is private to a process.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.770
Just like threads condition variables should be explicitly freed and

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.490
reallocated, we use the condition destroy call for that.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.550
And finally, a few pieces of advice regarding the use of condition variables.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.850
First make sure you don't forget to notify the waiting threads.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.060
Whenever any aspect off a predicate that some threads are waiting on change,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.910
make sure that you signal or

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.670
broadcast the correct condition variables that these threads are waiting on.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.330
Next, if you're ever in doubt whether you should use signal or

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.700
broadcast, use broadcast untill you figure out what the desired behaviour is.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.740
Note that with broadcast you will lose performance.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.530
So, make sure you use the correct notification mechanism, signal or

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.120
broadcast, when you need to wake up threads from a condition variable.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.530
Remember, since you don't actually need the mutex to signal and broadcast,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.910
it may be appropriate for you to remove that signal and broadcast operation.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.110
Until after you've unlocked the mutex,

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.720
just like what we saw in the introductory lecture about threads.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.880
We will point out some of these options during the discussion of

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.690
an actual pthreads example that we'll do next.
