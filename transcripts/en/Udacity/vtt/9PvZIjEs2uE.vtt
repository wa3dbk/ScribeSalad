00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.750
So having given you the high level description

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.550
of what ANTS toolkit does, let's dig a little

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.210
deeper and look at the structure of the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.840
ANTS capsule as well as the APIs provided by

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.460
ANTS in order to do capsule processing. First

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.550
of all, the header as I told you consists

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.060
of three parts. The original IP header, which

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.590
is important for routing the package towards the destination

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.850
if a node is a normal node, not an active node.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.110
And this is of course the payload that was generated by

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.740
the application. And in the middle is this ANTS header, and

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.160
there are two fields in this ANTS header that are particularly

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.660
important. One is a type field, the other is a prev

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.890
field. The type field is a way by which you can

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.060
identify the code that has to be executed to process this

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.660
capsule. And this type field is really an MD5 hash of the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.460
code that needs to be executed on this capsule,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.039
and we'll come back to that in a minute. And

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.307
the second field that I said is important is

00:00:58.307 --> 00:01:01.732
the prev field. And this prev field is the identity

00:01:01.732 --> 00:01:06.256
of the upstream node that successfully processed the capsule

00:01:06.256 --> 00:01:09.450
of this type. And this information is going to be

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.510
useful for us in terms of identifying the code that

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.640
needs to be executed in order to process this capsule.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.870
We'll come back to how these two fields are

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.990
actually used in processing a capsule once this capsule arrives

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.956
at an active node. The short hint that I'll

00:01:25.956 --> 00:01:29.072
give you is that the capsule itself, as you see,

00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:31.656
does not contain the code that needs to be

00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:35.304
executed to process this capsule, but it only contains a

00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:38.091
type field. And this type field is a vehicle by

00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:40.713
which we can identify the code that needs to be

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:43.486
executed to process this capsule. More on that

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:46.360
in a minute. First, let's talk about the

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.516
API that ANTS toolkit provides you. The most

00:01:49.516 --> 00:01:52.759
important function that we want to accomplish using the

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.002
ANTS toolkit is forwarding packets through the network

00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:59.625
intelligently. So routing the capsule is the most important

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:02.442
function that needs to be done. And that's

00:02:02.442 --> 00:02:05.860
most of what this ANTS API is all about.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.100
And that part is contained right here, saying that,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.570
well, route this packet in this manner, and deliver

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.150
the packet to an application. And this is the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.460
set of API calls that allows you to do

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.040
routing of the capsule through the network. This is

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.470
where what I said about virtualizing the network comes

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.870
in. Regardless of the actual topology, physical topology, I

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.460
can take routing decisions commensurate with the network flow requirements

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.000
contained in the capsule that arrives at a node.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.390
So the second part of the API is API

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.840
for manipulating what is called a soft-store. Now, soft-store

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.140
is storage that's available in every routing node for

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.540
personalizing the network flow with respect to a particular

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.330
type of capsule. And I mentioned earlier that the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.490
type is only a pointer to the code, not

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.850
the code itself. And the soft-store is a place where

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.190
we can store the code that corresponds to

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.160
a particular capsule type. So the primitives that

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.790
are available for manipulating the soft-store are things

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.100
like put object and get object. The soft-store

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.520
is basically key value store and in this

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.370
key value store, you can store whatever is

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.250
important for personalizing the network flow for capsules

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.954
of this type. An obvious candidate for storing

00:03:21.954 --> 00:03:24.564
in the soft-store is the code that is associated with

00:03:24.564 --> 00:03:26.960
this type. So you can store the code that is

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.430
associated with this type, so that future capsules of the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.190
same type, when it arrives at a particular node, they can

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.230
retrieve the code from the soft-store and execute the code

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.680
that needs to be executed for processing capsules of this type.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.096
Other interesting things that you might put into this soft-store

00:03:44.096 --> 00:03:47.329
are things like computed hints about the state of the network,

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.562
which can be used for future capsule processing for capsules of

00:03:50.562 --> 00:03:54.110
the same type. And the third category of API that's available

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.714
is querying the node for interesting tidbits about the state of

00:03:57.714 --> 00:04:01.590
the network or details about that node itself, for instance, what

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.718
is the identity of the node that I'm currently at, and

00:04:04.718 --> 00:04:07.574
what the local time is at this node, at this node,

00:04:07.574 --> 00:04:09.763
and so on and so forth. So these are the kinds

00:04:09.763 --> 00:04:12.500
of things that are available. So the key thing that I want

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.329
you to get out of looking at this ANTS API is that it is a very, very minimal

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:24.420
setup API. So the number of API calls fits in this little table here. So that's

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.640
the idea. Remember that routers are in the

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.320
public Internet. And if you're talking about executing code

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.520
in the router that is part of the public

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.560
Internet, the router program that we're executing at a

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.510
router node has to have certain important characteristics. Number

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.000
one, it has to be easy to program. Number two,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.088
it should be easy to debug, maintain, and understand. And

00:04:47.088 --> 00:04:49.780
number three, it should be very quick, because we are

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.980
talking about routing packets, and so the router program should

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.010
not take a long time to do its router processing.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.300
So the API, this very simple API, allows you to

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.040
generate very simple router programs that are easy to program

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.740
because the APIs are simple, easy to debug,

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.860
easy to maintain and understand. And the program itself

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.680
is pretty small, that it's going to take not a

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.880
humongous amount of time to do the packet processing.
