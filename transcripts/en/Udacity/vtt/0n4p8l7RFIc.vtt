00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.564
All right, here's what I did. I first of all computed the reduction 0 to 5 that

00:00:04.564 --> 00:00:09.215
you've seen just a few minutes ago and multiply that by 51 to get one of these

00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:17.041
six values. That's the job for red. It's the exact same for green, and for

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:23.390
blue. Let's try it out. When I run the program, I can pick an image. I get to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.440
see it before the change is applied. And when I click on OK, then the change is

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.529
applied. And when you look carefully, you'll now see that the image looks

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.505
coarser. It has fewer colors, for example, in this range here. Now fortunately,

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.882
my cat Eliza isn't on a distant planet. But if she was, then it would take far

00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:47.424
fewer pixels to send her image to me. The exact equations that we just used

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:51.422
aren't really important to remember. But the point that I wanted to make is

00:00:51.422 --> 00:00:55.094
that even though integer division doesn't sound like the most interesting thing

00:00:55.094 --> 00:01:00.598
in the world. It can be put to good use and give you a fun application. Go

00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:02.943
ahead and practice that a bit more with Sarah.
