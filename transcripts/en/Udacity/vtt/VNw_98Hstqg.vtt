00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.761
Okay Michael, so what I have here on
the screen is two formulas that tell you

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:09.527
how to compute the probability that
a particular action a is the optimal one

00:00:09.527 --> 00:00:12.810
given some evidence which
I'm calling the d sub a.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.779
That is the, d is the data set of labels
a number of times you said yes or

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.751
no for a b in the optimal action in
both the general case where there can

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:25.924
be any number of policies
that are optimal,

00:00:25.924 --> 00:00:31.069
that is any number of actions in
a particular state that could be optimal

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:36.428
versus the case where there can be
only one, the Highlander case, okay?

00:00:36.428 --> 00:00:38.939
So I'm just going to kind of read this
out to you and you can just ask as many

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.110
questions as you want but
we'll sort of see where it goes.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.380
So, we should read the first
equation in the following way.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.800
So all of these are for a particular
state and you just can apply this in

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.350
a given state because we're living in
Markov decision process and then we'd

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.580
have to worry about all the other states
where by the state we happen to be.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.680
This is the probability for a given
state, action a is the optimal and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.190
given a sequence of labels that say, yes
this is optimal, no this is not optimal

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.890
is equal to this quantity C is just
the probability, the human is correct,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.660
which was 0.8 in our last quiz and
was one in the quiz before that.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.240
Raised to the power delta sub a.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.570
Now what is delta sub a?

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.580
Well, delta is just the difference
between the number of times you said

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.690
yes, and the number of times
you said no to action a.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.880
Now what does that really mean?

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.710
Well remember as you said, when you
were kind of thinking this out loud for

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.090
the first one, that what we really
got is multinomials and binomials.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.840
A binomial is a special
case of multinomial.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.340
So what we really has is multinomials.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.200
What we're really doing
is flipping coins.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.340
So every time you sort of flip a coin,
you're getting some evidence of whether

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.050
the coin comes up heads or
tails more often.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.020
And so what you have here is
delta basically is a sufficient

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.240
statistic that summarizes
the entire sequence that you get.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.840
Now what this means in practice,
is that every time I say yes and no,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.260
it's as if they cancel each other out.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.710
They drag me back towards
the uniform distribution, or

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.210
whatever your prior happens to be.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.320
Now a lot of people find it difficult
to wrap their heads around.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.570
It feels like if I flip a coin twice and
it comes up heads once and

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.080
tails once,
that's evidence that it's a half.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.540
But if I flip a coin 1000 times and
500 times it says yes and 500 times it

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.160
says no, that's somehow more evidence
that it's a half and that's true but

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.080
actually in both cases, the maximum
likelihood answer is still one half.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.025
It's just in the second case,
you're even more confident about it and

00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:38.478
what we're doing here is we're measuring
basically the mean, not the variance.

00:02:38.478 --> 00:02:39.218
Does that make sense?

00:02:39.218 --> 00:02:39.838
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:39.838 --> 00:02:40.438
I think so.

00:02:40.438 --> 00:02:42.448
Right.
So, in some sense,

00:02:42.448 --> 00:02:46.760
it's not telling us how
sure we are of the answer.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.778
It's really just saying what the answer
is that best guesses the answer.

00:02:49.778 --> 00:02:52.807
&gt;&gt; Exactly right and and
what this delta kind of summarizes for

00:02:52.807 --> 00:02:56.503
you is the only thing that matters is
how many times you said yes versus how

00:02:56.503 --> 00:03:00.130
many times you said no, not how
many times you said yes on its own.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.472
So, in the general case,

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:05.132
what we're really saying here is
something kind of neat which is that we

00:03:05.132 --> 00:03:08.488
can we can treat every single
action as if they're independent.

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:11.584
And so the probability that a is optimal
depends only upon what you told me

00:03:11.584 --> 00:03:13.930
about a,
it doesn't depend upon anything else.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.270
Because as we did in the first example,
if you tell me that

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.270
the first action is optimal but
all of them could be optimal.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.760
There's multiple optimal policies, then
the fact you told me something about

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.520
that action doesn't actually tell me
anything about any other actions.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.580
And so what we have here is,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.070
basically the probability that I
would see that many times you said

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.570
yes normalized by the probability I
would see that many times that you would

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.580
say yes versus I would have said all
those times and been wrong about it.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.820
So C to the delta a is a sort of under
the assumption that you are correct.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.420
And 1 minus c is under
the assumption you are not correct.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.170
And that just falls out of
the binomial distribution.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.390
And if we plug in our original answers,

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.990
you would see that you end up with
the same thing that we got before and

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.550
the special case where
you've only seen one label.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.490
You with me?

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's cool, yeah I think so.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.760
So, because it's the binomial case,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.850
one per action,
we're not looking at any other actions.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.366
So the denominator there
comes from essentially,

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:17.740
the count of how likely it is that we'd
have those, that number that delta

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.890
number versus that if we were wrong,
we would have that delta number the 1-C.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.180
So yeah, I think that feels right to me.
