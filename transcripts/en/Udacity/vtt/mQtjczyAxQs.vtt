00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The approximate answer is 0.12.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
x minus mu squared is 4, this is 10 minus 8 to the square

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
divided by 4 equals 1.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The expression of the exponential is -1/2,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which is about 0.6.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This guy over here is approximately 0.2, which gives us as a product 0.12

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I won't torture you with any more questions like these, because they're really not fun,

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but we can program this now.
