00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.330
A picture is worth 1,000 words and

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.520
images play an integral
part of every website.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.960
The HTTP archive has it pegged
at near 1.2 megabytes per page,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.400
which means images take
up 65% of every website.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.820
In order to do responsive web design,
we need to consider images.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.590
If the rest of my page is changing
based on device characteristics.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.210
Wouldn't it make sense that my
images should be changing too?

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.010
&gt;&gt; You're absolutely right, Cam.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.940
Using the same image, but

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.150
changing the resolution is probably
one of the most common use cases.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.610
Think providing a standard image for
a laptop, but a 2X image for

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.960
a high DPI display, like
a Chromebook Pixel, or a Retina iMac.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.310
The best way to do this is using the
source set attribute on an image tag.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.970
With source set, the browser will
choose which file it wants, and

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.180
then only download that one.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.590
&gt;&gt; Well that might work for
logos and some other things, but

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.870
what about the case where I want
a different crop of an image?

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.840
It doesn't make sense to show a big,
wide image on a narrow portrait phone.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.660
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and
that's what's called art direction, and

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.060
where the new picture element come in.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.010
The picture element uses media
queries to select which image to use,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.190
but responsive images could
be a course of their own.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.990
Thankfully my good friend and

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.259
fellow developer advocate
Sam Dutton has you covered here.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.460
Hey, Sam.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.280
&gt;&gt; Thanks Pete, great stuff.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.410
When you're finished with this course,
you'd like to find out more about

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.050
responsive images, stuff like
the picture element source set, come and

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.990
check out our course
on responsive images.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.320
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Sam.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.230
&gt;&gt; So Pete, it seems like we've
covered all the usual elements for

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.350
responsive design, what about tables?

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.510
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.820
Let's take a look.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.320
&gt;&gt; Cool.
