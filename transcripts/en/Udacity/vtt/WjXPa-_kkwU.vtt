00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.370
Athena and Grant have shown us that all sorts of polynomials, not just

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.106
quadratics, can have imaginary zeroes. So now we found zeros that are integers,

00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:12.684
rational numbers, approximated numbers, and even zeros to the imaginary parts.

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:15.484
I think it would be a good idea if at this point we took a step back, and

00:00:15.484 --> 00:00:18.734
talked about how all these different kinds of zeros can work together to build

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:24.443
up a single polynomial function. Remember, a polynomials zeros, factors in

00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:28.389
degree, are all very closely related to one another.
