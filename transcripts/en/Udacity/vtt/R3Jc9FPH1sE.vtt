00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.980
We saw earlier that pods
can be restarted for

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.260
all kinds of reasons like
fail liveliness checks,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.200
readiness checks, a command,
and this leads to a problem.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.380
What happens if we want to
communicate with a set of pods.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.710
When they get restarted it might
have a different IP address.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.200
And this is where services come in.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.820
Instead of relying on pod
IP addresses which change,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.720
provide services as
a stable endpoint for pods.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.730
The pods that the service exposes
are based on a set of labels.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.980
If pods have the correct labels,
they are automatically picked up and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.040
exposed by our services.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.620
Now, the level of access the service
provides to a set of pods

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.000
depends on the services type.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.480
Currently there are three types.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.380
There is cluster IP
which is internal only.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.430
There's tight node port which gives each
node an external IP that's accessible.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.670
And then there's type load balancing
which adds a load balancer from

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.795
the cloud provider which forced traffic
from the service to nodes within it.

00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:07.210
Okay, it's time for
you to learn how to create a service and

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.950
use label selectors to expose the limits
set of those pods externally.
