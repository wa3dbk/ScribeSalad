We want to find factors of a and c that add up to b, or 1 in this case. 2 times

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.928
negative 15 is negative 30. And our positive 1 goes in the bottom. Here are the

00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:15.601
factor pairs for negative 30. Let the other side be the first factor negative in

00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:21.150
each pair. This factor pair adds up to 1, so I write negative 5 and 6. I rewrite

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.570
the positive 1x using negative 5 and 6 as coefficients for x. We use factoring

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.230
by grouping to remove an x and a positive 3 from the first group of terms and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.032
the second group of terms. This leaves us with our factored form x plus 3 times

00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:40.648
2x minus 5. Great job if you found the factor paired and even better if you got

00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:41.773
to the factor form.
