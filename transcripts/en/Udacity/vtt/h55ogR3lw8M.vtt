00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.620
Psychologists use research methods just like biologists and chemists do. The

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.610
only difference is, our questions are about thought and behavior, and their

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.400
questions are about things like plants or chemicals. This lesson is really

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.660
important, because research methods gives us a foundation for the rest of the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.490
course. because after all, without research, we wouldn't be able to learn

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.240
anything new. In this lesson you are going to learn the skills necessary to

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.610
become a better critical consumer research. Every day in the news there are

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.310
stories popping up about topics related to psychology. Let's take a look at

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.790
this one. Here we see that those who media multitask are 70% more likely to

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.250
experience symptoms of anxiety and depression. Now, can we say that media

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.650
multitasking causes symptoms of anxiety and depression? No, we cannot. And we

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.550
can't because this is an example of a correlational study. In this lesson we'll

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.610
see that the type of research design, dictates whether or not we can say a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.230
causal statement. Or whether or not we can say two variables are just related.
