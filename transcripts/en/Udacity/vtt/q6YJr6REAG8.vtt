00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to claim that the answer is the third one.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You could certainly argue that there is a better case for the first one,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but that would be pretty disappointing.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The reason that we trust this key is not because it's signed by VeriSign.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In fact, it actually is signed by VeriSign.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
When we look at that certificate, we see that it is signed.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It was issued by VeriSign, and it does have a certificate signature.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We could verify it against this public key,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but that would be verifying it against the same key that the certificate describes.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's what called a self-signed certificate.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This doesn't convince you of anything. Anyone could generate it like that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In fact, you can do that. You can generate one yourself.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If you're using a Mac, you have open SSL built-in

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and use that to generate a self-signed certificate.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But it doesn't prove anything.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The best answer here is that we trust it because we got it from some trusted source,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and we protected it and we know that it's valid.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
How that works in a web browser is there is a set of certificates that are built in.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You can download more, but you have to be careful.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If you download them, you need to know that they're secure.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If you look at your browser settings, you can see all the certificates that are built in.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
There are actually quite a lot of them.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Not all of these were always built in, so all the ones that are listed as built in were built in.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
They came with the browser, and we can see that there is one for VeriSign--

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
actually several for VeriSign--that were built in.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
These are trusted only because we think we got the browser from a trusted source,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and it had these certificates built in.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We can look at one of these certificates.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You'll notice that their rated as different classes.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What it means is mostly that someone was willing to pay more to VeriSign to get a higher certificate.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
If you pay more, they do a little more identity checking

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
to say that you're probably the one who's asking for the certificate.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But all the certificate proves is that VeriSign granted it to you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and decided that the person that they granted a certificate that said "I'm google.com"

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
probably had some affiliation with Google.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The higher the class the more you have to pay and the more work VeriSign does to validate that.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If we look at one of these certificates, we can see the root certificate that's built in.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
This is the root of trust. We're trusting this, because it came in the browser.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You'll notice that these have quite long expiration dates.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Since these are used to sign all these other certificates,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
if they expire, all the certificates they sign would break.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
That raises the question of what happens when there's a bad certificate.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
There have been several well-publicized incidents

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
where VeriSign or other certificate authorities

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
accidentally granted a certificate to someone who wasn't actually representing the company

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that they asked for a certificate from.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Revocation lists are one way to deal with that.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You can have a list of--well, these are signed certificates that aren't actually valid.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
If those are kept up to date, and the browser always checks them,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
then you could have a certificate be revoked even though it was signed.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
This is a pretty painful solution to this problem, though.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It requires always updating this list.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It means that the time between updates you're vulnerable if there is a bad certificate

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and requires a lot of extra work for the browser to validate a certificate.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The best solution, of course, would be never to grant a certificate without validating that identity.
