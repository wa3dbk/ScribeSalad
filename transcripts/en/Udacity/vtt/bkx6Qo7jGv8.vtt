00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.632
All of the numbers that we've worked with fall under the category of complex

00:00:03.632 --> 00:00:09.132
numbers. Complex numbers can have both real and imaginary components. So that

00:00:09.132 --> 00:00:14.137
means that real numbers and imaginary numbers are each subsets of the complex

00:00:14.137 --> 00:00:20.166
numbers. Within the real numbers, we have all of the same categories as we did

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:20.874
before.
