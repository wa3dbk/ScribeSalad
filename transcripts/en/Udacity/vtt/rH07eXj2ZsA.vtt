The Clinical Element Data Dictionary, or

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.900
CEDD, is a tool for implementers to
use in setting up their source data

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.130
in support of distributed queries
within a larger query health solution.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.960
This is not intended as a new
standard development effort, and

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.630
began with the elements already
specified in the CCD in which most

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.810
MER's already support since they were
required for stage one certification.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.850
Here's a simple example of the patient
allergy data element showing

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.720
how it ties to already-accepted
standards used in the CCD.
