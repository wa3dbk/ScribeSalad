Athena is one quarter of the way done with designing her logo. She has the

00:00:05.013 --> 00:00:09.310
bottom half of the right-hand side of the frame. But how can she complete it?

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.568
What equation do we need for the top half? So what then is the equation of this

00:00:13.568 --> 00:00:18.692
function, which is the reflection in the X axis of this equation. Please write

00:00:18.692 --> 00:00:21.460
the right-hand side of the new function right here.
