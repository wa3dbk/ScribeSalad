00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.080
Here is a concrete example of an

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.010
extension. It's a fairly standard implementation, let's say

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.560
of Unix operating system, but it is implemented

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.140
as an extension on top of the spin.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.540
Here is a more fun example. A client

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.750
server application that is implemented directly on top

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.180
of spin as an extension. In other words,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.610
there is no operating system. A display client

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.370
uses an extension interface to implement the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.670
functionality for displaying video that is going to

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.070
be sent by a video server. So both of these are extensions on top of basic

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.400
spin, and provide exactly the functionality that

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.530
is needed for the video server application. And

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.880
the bounding box here is showing spin and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.610
the extensions thereof. And similarly the bounding box

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.320
here is showing spin and the extension thereof. In this case

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.715
it is an entire operating system, in this case it is just

00:00:57.715 --> 00:01:02.000
the client of the video server. And in this case it is

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.600
just the video server itself as an extension on top of spin.
