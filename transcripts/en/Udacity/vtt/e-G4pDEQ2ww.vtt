Congratulations, if
you've made it this far.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.120
You've learned so
much about mapping, satellite views,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.000
drawing on a map, markers, custom pins,
Street View, and a whole lot more.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.460
It's been a lot of material covering
a lot of territory, pun fully intended.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.610
And, I hope you've been inspired to
think about how you could make your app

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.810
better by using Rich Mapping.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.920
Or indeed, maybe you have an idea for an
app that could be built around Mapping.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.700
Think about what you can do, if you
combine it with Location Services and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.700
other Google APIs.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.390
With that, I'll sign off in the hope
that you've really enjoyed this course.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.120
I look forward to seeing
what you can do with Maps

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.830
in your future Android applications.
