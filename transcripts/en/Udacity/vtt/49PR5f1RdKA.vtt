00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.840
So, let's see if we know how to
add some prefetch instructions.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.860
Suppose we have a program like this
where i goes from 0 to 1000 and

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.056
j goes from 0 to 1000 and
in every iteration of this inner

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:23.030
loop we add to the ith element of
the a array the element of the b matrix.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.410
So what is really happening here, is
that in the first iteration of the outer

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.540
loop, we will compute a[0],
then a[1], and so on, and we do that

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.470
by basically adding up all the
appropriate elements from the b array.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.220
Let's say that the elements of the a and
b arrays are both

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.700
floating point numbers,
that they're each 8 bytes in size.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.860
Let's say that the cache size is 16kB,
fully associative, with LRU replacement.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.850
Let's say that a single
iteration of this inner loop

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.390
takes 10 cycles if there are no misses,
and that the miss penalty

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.730
is 200 cycles, because the memory
latency is 200 cycles.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:13.010
The question for you is, if we insert
a prefetch instruction here so

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.050
that we can prefetch one of
the next a elements, what should

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.790
be the distance here or check this,
if we simply should not be doing this.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.450
Here, for
prefetching elements of B in this loop,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.240
what is the distance at which
we should be prefetching?

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.850
Or should we just not be doing this?
