00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.430
Alright, let's take a look at how we implemented the playWorldSound function.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.714
Now remember it takes the parameters, first the soundURL representing the sound

00:00:09.714 --> 00:00:13.368
that we want to play in the world, and then the x and y position that this

00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:19.360
sound should be played at. So first we're going to check if the player is null

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.824
for some reason, just as a sanity check. If it is, then we simply return and

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:27.595
don't worry about playing it. If there's no players to hear the sound, does the

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:31.564
sound actually play? And we're going to do a little bit of shorthand here just

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:34.480
to make it a bit easier for us to write for ourselves by shortening

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.009
gGameEngine.gMap to just gMap, locally. And now we're going to do the

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:46.737
calculation for fading the volume out. Based upon the distance from the player

00:00:46.737 --> 00:00:51.773
that the sound is supposed to be played at. First, we check the viewSize of

00:00:51.773 --> 00:00:56.882
the, for the map's viewRect. And we're actually going to do this as a square

00:00:56.882 --> 00:01:02.220
rather than as a rectangle for simplicity's sake. So we take the maximum of the

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.774
width and the height. Then we multiply it by half, since we don't want the full

00:01:06.774 --> 00:01:11.322
width. We only want the half since we're going to set the center of that view

00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:17.138
size to be the player's current position. And we want the distance from the

00:01:17.138 --> 00:01:22.170
player to the sound. Now, we're going to take the x value, the absolute x

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.330
value, from the player position to the sound's x position, and similarly for

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.442
the y value. And now, we simply compute the distance function, which is the

00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:36.992
same one that you've probably learned in high school, which is the square root

00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:43.420
of the x distance squared plus the y distance squared. Now we're going to

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.396
normalize that distance, and what we mean by that is we're going to take the

00:01:46.396 --> 00:01:49.564
distance to the observer that we've just calculated, and we're going to divide

00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:52.492
that by the view size that we calculated earlier to see how many view sizes

00:01:52.492 --> 00:01:57.632
from the player we are. Like we talked about four. If we are more than two view

00:01:57.632 --> 00:02:01.980
sizes away, then maybe want to start reducing the sound like we discussed. So

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.524
in this case, if the normal distance is greater than one view size away, then

00:02:07.524 --> 00:02:13.068
we set the norm distance to one, since we're going to reduce the volume by the

00:02:13.068 --> 00:02:18.524
norm distance later on, and it doesn't really make sense to have a negative

00:02:18.524 --> 00:02:26.468
volume. Norm, norm distance, is for whatever reason less than zero, then we

00:02:26.468 --> 00:02:31.683
simply return and don't play. And then we create a call back function. And

00:02:31.683 --> 00:02:35.899
immediately calls play sound on that sound object. The path of that sound

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:39.799
object that is and with settings saying looping is false and that volume is the

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.577
volume that we have just calculated. So, once this function is written, we'll

00:02:45.577 --> 00:02:49.861
have a nice effect where the further the sound is away from a player, the more

00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:54.009
quietly it's played until the player can't hear it at all, creating a more

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:58.614
realistic sound environment.
