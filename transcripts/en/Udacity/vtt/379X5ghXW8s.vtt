00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.788
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here, the correct answer was b. Great job if you got that one right. First,

00:00:05.788 --> 00:00:11.890
let's solve this inequality for y. I can subtract 10 from both sides to get 5 y

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.938
on the right, and 2 x minus 10 on the left. Then, I divide each term by 5. So, 2

00:00:17.938 --> 00:00:23.313
5th x minus 2 is greater than or equal to y. We're used to seeing y on the left

00:00:23.313 --> 00:00:28.336
side of the inequality, so let's rearrange this inequality. So, I have y is less

00:00:28.336 --> 00:00:32.969
than or equal to 2 5th x minus 2. Notice this inequality symbol is pointing

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.558
towards the y in both inequalities. That's a great way that you can check to

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:42.454
make sure you wrote it correctly. First, we plot our y-intercept at negative 2.

00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:47.808
And then, we use our slope, 2 5th. We rise 2 units and run to the right 5 units.

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:53.039
So there's the next point. I use a solid line here because that could be equal

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.741
to the line. We have y is less than or equal to, so points on this should

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:03.824
satisfy this inequality. Again, I'm going to use the origin as a test point, and

00:01:03.824 --> 00:01:09.378
I get 0 is less than or equal to negative 2. This statement's not true, so I

00:01:09.378 --> 00:01:14.545
don't want this region. I need to shade below. And here's our graph.
