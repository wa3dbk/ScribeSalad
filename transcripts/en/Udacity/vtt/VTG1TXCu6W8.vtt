00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.170
We're going to keep coming back to this equation as we learn new skills to see

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.235
if we can solve it. But for now let's start by solving a number puzzle. For

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:12.327
number puzzles, we're going to find 2 numbers that multiply to give us the top

00:00:12.327 --> 00:00:16.431
number and that add to give the bottom number. So for this one I want to find

00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:20.676
factors of 20 that sum to 9. We can think about it in our heads or make a list

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:24.753
of the factor pairs. This is usually more helpful. We start with 1 since 1

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:29.168
divides into any number. 1 times 20 is 20. So this is definitely a factor pair.

00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:33.244
2 times 10 is 20, that's another one and 4 times is 20. So this is our third

00:00:33.244 --> 00:00:37.715
factor pair. I don't need to continue writing any more factor pairs because well

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:42.266
I've repeated one of them already. Ten and two would end up being repeated as

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:47.054
would 20 and one if I continued listing factor pairs so if I'm going in order I

00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:51.881
can just stop when I have a repeat. I look at my list and I see which one of the

00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:56.485
pairs adds up to nine, that must be this one. So four and five would be the

00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:58.410
answer to this number puzzle.
