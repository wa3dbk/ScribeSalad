00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.273
So, from the last problem, we were able to figure out that x equals 3. But what

00:00:05.273 --> 00:00:10.500
if the exponent is not known? What if we had this equation? This second

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.350
equation is called an exponential equation. It's called that since the exponent

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.773
is the variable, and it's unknown. But we can apply similar reasoning. Let's

00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:25.904
take 27 and write it with a base of 3. We can rewrite 27 as 3 to the third

00:00:25.904 --> 00:00:31.416
power. And since these two bases are the same. We know the exponents must be

00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:36.746
equal in order for the two numbers to be the same. So here we know that this x

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:43.380
must equal this exponent. X must equal 3. In general, whenever we have x to the

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.156
a, equal x to the b, we know that the exponents a and b must be equal, since

00:00:47.156 --> 00:00:53.151
their bases are equal. This works in general so long as x, which is the base,

00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:57.900
is not equal to 0 or 1. So for an equation like this, what do you think x

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.791
equals? Write it here.
