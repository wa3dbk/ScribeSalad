00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.121
So let's think about this again. What should the denominator look like in order

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:08.805
to be able to take a cube root of this denominator? We know that each of these

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:13.290
factors needs to be raised to a power that is divisible by 3. So we'll multiply

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.515
this numerator by something. And this denominator by something to change this,

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:22.390
to what we need. So we need to multiply this numerator and this denominator by

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.353
some sort of expression. When we do that, we want to get an expression inside

00:00:26.353 --> 00:00:30.394
of our cubed root that can be simplified. So you tell me. What should this

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:34.545
expression be? You want to use the factor of 3, x and y and indicate their

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:39.194
powers. Don't include the cube root inside of this box, since I already have it

00:00:39.194 --> 00:00:44.452
written for you outside. Keep in mind that you want all of your power divisible

00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:45.596
by 3.
