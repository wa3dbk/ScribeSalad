&gt;&gt; Image editing software like Photoshop and apps like Instagram or

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.000
Snapchat allow you to apply visual effects to images.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.810
You might be thinking why would I want to edit images in a browser?

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.240
&gt;&gt; It's a good question.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.720
For one thing, most photos only exist in digital formats.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.499
The computing power needed to process a single image is well,

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:19.680
pretty much negligible.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.853
And doing things locally allows the user to make changes without a full

00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:24.425
round trip to the server and back.

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:26.564
And most importantly, it's actually a lot of fun.

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:27.545
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:31.605
We might make an image black and white by averaging the red, green and

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:32.880
blue values.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.820
&gt;&gt; Or we could invert the colors by assigning the pixels to the compliments of

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.540
their current values.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.691
&gt;&gt; Or maybe we wanted to turn down the lights and turn on night vision mode.

00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:44.605
&gt;&gt; We'll be working without the help of an external library.

00:00:44.605 --> 00:00:47.629
But check the instructor notes for software packages and

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.293
applications to make advance photo editing easy inside the canvas.
