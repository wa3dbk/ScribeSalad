00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.689
Let's look at the solution to our latest
virtual to physical translation quiz,

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.470
where we had the memory access times and
the hit rates for the cache, and

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.090
we were assuming that
the three-level page table

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.630
now can be cached just like
data with the same hit rate.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.760
Now we have one cycle to compute
the virtual address, followed by,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.040
for each level of the page table,
three times, we need to do

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.220
one cycle to access the cache plus
10% of the time for each of those.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.332
We will have a miss and go to memory
to fetch the page table entry.

00:00:35.332 --> 00:00:41.550
And then after we do that, We can
access the data, which takes one cycle

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.540
plus 10% of the time, it takes
ten more cycles to access memory.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.380
So now we have nine cycles altogether,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.470
six of which are used by virtual
to physical translation.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.090
And only three for
the instruction itself and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.060
the memory access, including the misses.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.600
So we can see that the virtual to
physical translation is expensive,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.470
even if we allow page table entries
to be treated as data and cached.
