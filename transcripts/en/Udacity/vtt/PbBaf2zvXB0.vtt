00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.650
You know, the point about taking these pictures is

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.200
to tell a story, to communicate. Don't try to

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.970
win an art contest. Don't try to win a

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.670
photography contest. Don't have artistic lighting that puts some things

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.370
in shadow or in the dark. We want to show

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.300
the design features. What's really important for the designer to

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.840
understand, or for you to tell the story to

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.940
your audience? So let's take a, let's take a look.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.550
Here's a picture of a train station. I wanted to

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.680
show that accidental social cues can serve as signifiers. You

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.100
know when you rush to the train platform, how do

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.800
you know if you missed the train? Well if there

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.780
are people waiting, you probably didn't miss it. If it's

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.520
empty, oops maybe you did. So to tell the story

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.990
I had to get to the train platform long before

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.430
the train was scheduled to arrive, carefully lean against the post

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.150
sign, wasn't going to change my position, and take pictures

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.410
as the people arrived. More and more pictures, because

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.990
I didn't know when the train would come. When

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.870
the train finally came, I then waited until the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.000
train left and the platform was empty and I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.130
took the last picture. Was it worth it? Yes.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.810
To tell the story of the destination control elevator,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.460
took a lot of pictures and some editing. And even

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.740
editing a label to understand the picture The photos

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.000
took a lot of work with a photo application, because

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.890
I had to crop the photos. So you could put

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.010
them together properly. And I cropped the photos, so when

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.490
I wanted to show the controls, you saw only

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.070
the control and nothing else that was distracting. So, four

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.860
different pictures tell the story. But once again, it was

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.690
worth it. Sometimes a single photo is enough to make

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.480
the point. You don't always have to have a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.930
sequence of photos. So here's one, a picture of push

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.610
and pull doors. Same hardware in both doors, yet one

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.870
is push and one is pull. I crop the original

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.430
photograph and I darkened the glass, so the objects

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.720
behind the window were not as visible. That's okay to

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.680
do. It would not be ethical to fake it. To

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.070
put objects in that really weren't in the scene, or

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.389
to take away things that really were present.
