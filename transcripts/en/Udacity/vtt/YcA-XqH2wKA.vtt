00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.510
So think about this scenario. You're sitting in class. Your professor is

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.982
telling you everything that's going to be on your exam, and you really need to

00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:11.286
write all this down, but you forgot a pen so the girl next to you lends you

00:00:11.286 --> 00:00:16.334
one. Okay, now you have your pen, back to focusing on what the professor is

00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:20.920
saying. And ignoring the fact that the room is freezing and the guy to your

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.170
right is smacking his gum. Oh, man, there's so much on the slide to write down

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.933
before the professor moves on, hurry, write, write, write, but wait. Why are

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:32.840
people laughing? You look around and you notice that people are looking at a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.410
guy standing outside the window with roses. And a huge sign that says I love

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.054
you Torry, be mine. The girl next to you said that guy recited a poem using

00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:47.850
like ten poster boards, while doing an interpretive dance. How on earth did you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.462
miss that? Well, back to writing before the slide changes. You're almost done

00:00:51.462 --> 00:00:54.423
writing the list of topics for your final when you hear two people behind you

00:00:54.423 --> 00:00:57.478
talking about your favorite band and saying they're going to the concert next

00:00:57.478 --> 00:01:02.795
week. Oh, man, you've got to get tickets for that concert. Oh no. Slide just

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:06.380
changed. Okay, now you have to focus on your professor's closing remarks.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.832
Because this is the essay portion of the exam. You know, it's going to be hard,

00:01:09.832 --> 00:01:14.044
but you can do it. Okay, so now class is over. You turn and give the pen back

00:01:14.044 --> 00:01:17.206
to the girl you borrowed it from, but you notice that she's not there, it's a

00:01:17.206 --> 00:01:22.628
guy sitting next to you and he's sleeping on his desk. When did that happen?
