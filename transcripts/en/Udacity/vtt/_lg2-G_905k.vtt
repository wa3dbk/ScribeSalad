00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.448
It turns out that we subtract the exponents. We do a minus b. We can see that in

00:00:05.448 --> 00:00:10.396
the first example, we have 3 to the 4th divided by 3 squared. So 3 to the 4

00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:15.514
minus 2, or 3 squared. The same is true for f. We have 8 minus 5, or f cubed.

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:21.100
For the last one, we leave our numbers in the front as a fraction, and then we

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.238
have w to the 8 minus 3, or w to the 5th. We saw the fraction was reduced to 2

00:00:26.238 --> 00:00:28.523
3rds. This gave us our final result.
