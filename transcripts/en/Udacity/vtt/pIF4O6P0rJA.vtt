00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.990
Let's see if we can tackle a motion problem together. Janet and Rohan agree to

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.526
meet at LAX, the Los Angeles airport. Janet's going to travel 250 miles, while

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:14.360
Rohan is going to travel 300 miles. If Rohan travels 20 miles faster than

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.080
Janet, and they both spend the same amount of time traveling let's see if we

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.768
can find Janet's speed. Now this looks like a complicated problem but we're

00:00:22.768 --> 00:00:26.736
going to break it up into steps and see if we can tackle it together. Now for

00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:31.200
any of these motion problems I think it's best to use a table. A table like

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.720
this helps us organize our information so we can figure out the distance, the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.344
rate and the time for each of the objects. In this case we're wondering about

00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:44.382
Janet's speed and Rohan's speed. So read through this problem and then when you

00:00:44.382 --> 00:00:48.504
think you understand it try to identify what should be the variable. Which of

00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:50.940
these amounts should be our variable so that way we can set up the right

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.490
expressions to begin solving our problem.
