00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.190
So let's wrap up our discussion for today and

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.070
also wrap up the foundational unit of our course as a whole. We started off

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.240
today by revisiting this notion of Cognitive architectures that we talked about

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.990
at the very beginning of the course. We use that to contextual our discussion of

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.290
Production systems, specifically those implemented in a framework called SOAR.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.550
As we saw, production systems enable action selection.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.020
They help us map percepts in the world into actions. Of course,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.620
this is only one of the many things that a production system can do.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.090
It can really map any kind of antecedent into any kind of consequent. But

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.259
in our example, we saw how the production system for

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.170
a pitcher can map percepts from a baseball game into pitch selection.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.440
We then talked about impasses and how when a production system hits an impasse,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.250
it can use chunking to learn a new rule to overcome that impasse.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.280
This is the first time we've encountered learning in our course, but

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.130
learning is actually going to be foundational to everything we talk about from

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.990
here on. This wraps up the fundamentals unit of our course.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.730
Next time we're going to talk about frames,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.560
which we actually saw a little bit of today. Frames are going to become

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.220
a knowledge representation that we'll use throughout the rest of our course.
