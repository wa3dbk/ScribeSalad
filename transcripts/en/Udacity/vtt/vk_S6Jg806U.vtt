00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.308
Next, we are going to look at how to enter the numbers we've been talking about

00:00:04.308 --> 00:00:09.927
into a calculator and convert from scientific notation. For example, 3 times 10

00:00:09.927 --> 00:00:14.372
the 3rd to a notation we usually use 3000. Now, your calculator may differ a

00:00:14.372 --> 00:00:18.445
bit from the one that I'm going to use. And I would encourage you to use your

00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:23.000
own calculator, or choose Google calculator, like I'm going to. Let's think

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.432
about the number, 5 times 10 to the 2nd. If you take this into a scientific

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:30.888
calculator, and then pressed Enter, what number do you think the calculator

00:00:30.888 --> 00:00:32.728
would show you?
