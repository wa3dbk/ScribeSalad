00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.760
&gt;&gt; I'm going to do a quick
review of function syntax and

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.500
some of the other things
we've seen with functions.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.070
We know that a basic function
starts with the func keyword and

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.970
then a function name.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.470
And then, anything we want in the body
of the function goes in between

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.580
the curly braces here.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.890
Some other formats you may see
are like this one that takes one

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.060
integer parameter.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.080
And you can see its type Int,
indicated here.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.790
And this last example we see
takes multiple parameters.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.005
We have one integer parameter and
then a second integer parameter.

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.023
And as we've mentioned, and
you've probably noticed,

00:00:32.023 --> 00:00:33.765
you've been using functions
since the maze app.

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:36.285
Here are two examples
of the print function.

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:40.625
And you'll notice here on the right side
we can see what is being printed out.

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:43.525
Or you can click these bubbles to
blow it out into the middle of

00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:45.135
the playground.

00:00:45.135 --> 00:00:48.870
Next, let's see an example of
defining our own function say hello.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.500
This function takes no parameters and
it prints out hello.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.690
Nothing too complex here.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.250
Let's take this one step forward and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.880
look at a function
that takes a parameter.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.930
If we scroll down a little bit we'll see
this is the function sayHelloToStudent.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.760
And all this boilerplate code up here at
the top is to create a Student struct

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.940
and initialize some
Student struct instances.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.040
And then, in the body of the function
we've taken the student parameter and

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.920
we're printing out it's name.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.730
And since it's called multiple times,
if we click

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.450
this little white circle here to blow
it out we see the very last printout.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.070
But if you click value
history we can see all

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.460
three of the printouts because
of these function calls here.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.970
In this next example,
we have the same student struct,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.620
and we have a new function
called greet student.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.980
It takes multiple parameters.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.460
It takes one student parameter and
then a boolean parameter called late for

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.630
class.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.690
To call this function,
we write the function name,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.012
greetStudent, followed by our student
struct instance, in this case gabrielle.

00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:48.580
And then, we need the external
parameter name, which for

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.750
this boolean value is late for class.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.670
And then, a boolean value,
in this case false.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.670
And here we see the output
of the three function calls.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.340
Let's move on to naming parameters.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.740
I really want to focus on this section.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.880
The code here at the top
is the same as before.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.970
We define a student struct, and then we
create some student struct instances.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.330
But the function definition is where
things really get interesting.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.820
For the student parameter we
specified both an external name and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.210
an internal name.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.370
And then the lateForClass, by default,
uses this same internal and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.020
external name lateForClass.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.240
So, we can see here at the bottom for
all three of these function calls

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.010
we're using the external names for
both parameters.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.260
And remember, by default the very
first parameter normally doesn't use

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.410
an external parameter name unless
you explicitly specify one.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.870
Now, I want to show you something that
took me a really long time to understand

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.710
when I was looking at
Apple's documentation.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.260
And you're going to be
doing this more and more.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.650
We haven't started to
talk about classes yet.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.190
Classes can have functions known as
methods that are associated with them.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.665
This is the UIViewController Class.

00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:52.510
And let's pick one of its methods.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.900
I'm going to search for
viewWILLDisappear.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.840
If we click viewWILLDisappear it'll blow
out all the extra information about this

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.420
particular method.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.902
So, we can look at its swift
definition here at the top.

00:03:04.902 --> 00:03:08.100
Notice how the function takes
one parameter, animated.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.410
And for
an external name it uses an underscore.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.460
When you see this on Apple's
documentation it means that default

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.000
external parameter name should be used.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.980
And remember, since this is the first
parameter, the default external name for

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.550
it is nothing.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.880
It just is omitted because
its the first parameter.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.550
And notice, the viewWillDisappear does
not use any external parameter name, and

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.520
that's the default behavior for
the first parameter.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.020
And that's it.
