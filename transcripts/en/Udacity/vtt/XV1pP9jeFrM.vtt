We changed our equation to look like this now. Let's think about this new

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:08.699
equation. We know x really represents some number so I have one number here

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:13.101
added to 2 and I have another number here added to 3. We really have a number

00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:17.887
times a number equals 0. Which of these statements must be true about the two

00:00:17.887 --> 00:00:20.093
numbers? Choose the best choice.
