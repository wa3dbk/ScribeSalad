00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.140
Congratulations, you successfully
completed your master resume.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.760
You now have an index sheet of all
of your professional experience.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.290
Now, you are ready to begin
crafting a targeted resume.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.690
In this phase of the lesson,
envision yourself as a cook.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.441
Your master resume is your pantry full
of good ingredients and now you need to

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:22.150
use these items to make a targeted
resume, much like you would a good meal.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.647
Because even the best ingredients can
still make a bad meal, you want to

00:00:25.647 --> 00:00:29.743
keep in mind moderation, planning, and
tactfulness in this creative endeavor.

00:00:29.743 --> 00:00:33.467
Just like a cook gets to be creative in
what ingredients to use to make a meal,

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:37.133
you'll also get to be selective when
you decide on what elements to include

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:37.964
in your resume.

00:00:37.964 --> 00:00:38.850
Let's get cooking.
