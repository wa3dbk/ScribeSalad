00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.390
Recall that congestion collapse occurs when packets

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.900
consume valuable network resources only to get dropped

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.810
later at a downstream link. And although the

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.250
network is forwarding packets, none of them actually

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.800
reach the destination and no useful communication

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.690
occurs, resulting in what we called congestion collapse.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.400
We talked about congestion collapse in an earlier

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.050
lesson in this course. Recall that the goal

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.890
of TCP is to prevent congestion collapse. In this assignment, you will

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.250
become familiar with the Mininet environment,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.640
creating custom network topologies, running programs in

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.680
virtual hosts that generate TCP traffic,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.300
and learn about TCP congestion control, an

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.000
the TCP sawtooth. You'll also see how bandwidth is shared across multiple flows.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.650
We are going to explore these concepts in a

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.460
particular topology that we'll just call a parking lot. So

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.090
in the assignment, you'll create the topology below with the following

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.470
parameters. N will be the number of receivers connected via

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.030
this switch like topology. The data rate of each link will be 100 megabits

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.680
per second and the delay of each link

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.210
will be one millisecond. Now your going to used

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.640
iperf to generate simultaneous TCP flows from each

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.500
of the senders. To the lone receiver. Then you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.605
going to plot the time series of throughput versus

00:01:34.605 --> 00:01:37.210
time for each of these senders. For each

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.740
of your experiments as you vary the value

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.680
of N. Your plot should run for 60 seconds.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.520
We have given an initial file called parkinglot.py.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.090
Your goal is to fill in the gaps.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.240
You'll need to both fill in the part

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.780
that sets up the topology using a parameter of

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.970
N, and then you'll need to fill in

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.790
the part that actually generates the TCP flows

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.890
between the senders, and the receiver using Iperf,

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.620
and monitors the throughput of each of these flows.
