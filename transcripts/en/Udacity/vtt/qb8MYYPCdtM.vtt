00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.030
Our final answer is a to the 6th, times b to the 8th, divided by 4. You might

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.949
have written it as 1 4th times a to the 6th, times b to the 8th. This is also

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:11.806
correct. You would have just been putting the 1 4th out in front of our two

00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:15.933
factors. We start by moving this a to the negative 3 to denominator. Next, we

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:20.400
take the reciprocal of our base, because we have a negative exponent. So I flip

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.197
the fraction over, and change my exponent from negative to positive. Finally, we

00:00:26.197 --> 00:00:31.708
square each of our factors. A cube squared is a to the 6th. B to the 4th squared

00:00:31.708 --> 00:00:35.894
is b to the 8th. And 2 squared is 4. Here's our final answer.
