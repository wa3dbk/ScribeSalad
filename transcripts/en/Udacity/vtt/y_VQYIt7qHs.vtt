00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.814
Now that Grant's finally made a decision about which cleaning solution brand to

00:00:04.826 --> 00:00:09.410
go with, he's decided to sell all the different products he's marketing in a

00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:13.889
package. He's going to sell nozzles and wipers and cleaning solution for one

00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:18.301
fabulous deal. Taking all the various costs of creating his products and

00:00:18.313 --> 00:00:23.310
shipping them and everything into account, Grant calculates that he'll make a

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:28.520
profit of $1000 for every 60 glasses cleaning sets that he sells. And if he

00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:33.960
sells 100 glasses cleaning sets he'll make a profit of $1200, assuming that the

00:00:33.972 --> 00:00:38.835
relationship between number of cleaning sets sold and profits is linear, or in

00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:44.247
other words lies on a straight line, we should be able to predict, how much of a

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:49.294
profit Grant will make, for any number of glasses cleaning sets that he might

00:00:49.306 --> 00:00:54.489
sell. It would be really great if we could plot this information on a graph. And

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:59.246
then use that graph to find out about other points on the line. If we let x

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:04.810
equal the number of cleaning sets that Grant sells and y equal his profit in

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:10.976
dollars, can you write each of these pieces of information as a point on the

00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:14.177
line that we're going to be able to draw?
