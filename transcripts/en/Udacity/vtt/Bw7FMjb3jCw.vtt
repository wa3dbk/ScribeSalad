00:00:00.164 --> 00:00:02.125
This time I’ve written a regular expression at

00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:04.705
the top in Python syntax and I’ve drawn four

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:06.968
finite state machines. I would like you to check

00:00:06.968 --> 00:00:09.168
each finite state machine that accepts exactly

00:00:09.168 --> 00:00:11.845
the same language as it is regular expression.
