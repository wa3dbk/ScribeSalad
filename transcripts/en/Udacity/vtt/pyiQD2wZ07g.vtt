00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.470
Now it's time for you to go create a folder structure for your project.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.900
Inside, you're going to need a CSS file for

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.380
your framework, and you'll also need a test.html file.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.880
The structure you create for your portfolio folder should look something like

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.840
this, and you can use the structure you created in the last lesson.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.370
Make sure that you have a folder for

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.030
your CSS files, because we might need more than one.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.890
In large products that's pretty common,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.170
so it's a good idea to have this organization from the very beginning.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.180
I'm going to do two things to make sure this is correct.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.990
First off I'm going to create a style in main.css which is going to be

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.960
linked in test.html.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.300
Then I'll open up test.html with some code in it, just to test.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.455
And we'll make sure that those CSS styles and

00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:46.348
main.css are applying to test.html.

00:00:46.348 --> 00:00:50.830
Within test.html I created a link to main.css,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.670
which is of course within the css directory.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.060
Inside the body I added framework Test Page, and I included it within an h1 tag.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.520
In main.css, to make sure it's working, I changed the color of the h1 tag to

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.110
green, so we should see the text framework test page show up in a page in green.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.640
Let's take a look.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.090
So I'm over in the browser.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.480
I go to File &gt; Open, which let's me open this test.html file.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.130
I'll click Open, and here we see, framework test page show up in green.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.960
Let's just triple check to make sure this is right.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.700
Let's change the color to blue and see if it works.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.430
Save, come back over, I will hit refresh, and now,

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.190
framework test page is in blue.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.930
So we know we've got our HTML and CSS files in the right place.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.460
Now, I want you to set up your folder structure and files.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.920
When you're done, it should look like what you see here.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.550
Check this box when you're ready to move on.
