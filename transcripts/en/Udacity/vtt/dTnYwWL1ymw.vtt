00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.960
Downloading code into the kernel and secure binding, how is this secure? This is

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.170
a bit dicey. Here, the library operating system is given an ability to

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.910
drop code into the kernel. The rationale

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.360
is purely a performance one. Namely, avoid

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.520
border crossings. But obviously it can be

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.320
a serious security loophole. Even in spin

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.340
we've noticed that a core service may have to step outside the language

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.310
enforce protection mechanism. In order to control

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.160
hardware resources. Bottom line is, while both

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.140
SPIN and Exokernel start out with the idea of allowing extensibility, they may

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.870
have to necessarily restrict who will be allowed to do such extensions. Not any

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.840
arbitrary user. It has to be a trusted set of users.
