00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.003
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; From the last problems, we could find out the supplement of an angle by

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:08.041
subtracting it from 180 degrees. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So let's write an expression for the

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.445
supplement of any angle. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; If I have some angle x, I don't know what it is, how

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:16.763
do I find the supplement? Write your expression here, and don't worry about

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:18.265
putting the degree symbol.
