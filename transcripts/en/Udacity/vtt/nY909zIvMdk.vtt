00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So for the programming quiz your goal is to define a fast modular exponentiation procedure--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
call it mod underscore EXP--that takes as inputs A, B, and Q,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and returns the value of A raised to the B power mod Q,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and its running time should be linear in the size--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
meaning the number of bits to represent the input B.
