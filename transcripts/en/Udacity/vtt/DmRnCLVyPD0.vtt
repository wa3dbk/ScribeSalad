00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.170
So here's the answer. What we have to do is

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.540
find these two double quotes. So we know that we

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.070
want to start looking from start_link, we can't start from the

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.710
beginning of page. So we want to use find on page, passing

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.590
in the double quote, which is what we're looking for,

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.730
starting from the start_link position. So here's how we need to

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.710
do that, we're going to initialize the variable, start_quote, which is

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.670
where that double quote that starts the url is. And what

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.940
we want to do is use page.find, to find in page.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.560
The string that we want to find is that double quote. To

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.260
make a double quote as a string, we need to use

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.790
a single quote, followed by a double quote, followed by a single

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.180
quote. We also need to pass in a second parameter. We

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.990
don't want to find the first double quote in the page, because

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.390
that might not be part of a link tag. So we

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.850
also need to pass in the variable start_link. So that makes find

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.190
start from the position of start_link look for the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.660
double quote, and it will return the location where that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.750
start quote appears. We also need to find the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.210
end quote. We'll call that end_quote. To find the end_quote

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.870
we don't want to start from the start_link. If we

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.620
started looking from the start_link we'd find the start_quote again.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.510
To find the end_quote we need to look starting

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.970
from after the start_quote. So we're going to use page.find again.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.460
Again looking for a double quote, so passing in

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.490
the double quote as the string we're searching for. We

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.810
need to start from the position of start_quote. We

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.300
can't start from just the position of start_quote. If we

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.380
started from start_quote, we'd find just the start_quote itself.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.600
We knew to start one after that position, so we

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.010
need to add 1 to start_quote. And if we start

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.860
looking from there, we'll find the first quote after that.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.020
That's the quote that ends the string. So the final

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.500
thing we want to do, is set the variable url.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.480
So we'll initialize url, to the string that we find

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.190
between the start quote and the end quote. And so

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.700
we can do that using the string selection. We're selecting

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.830
from the string page. We have to think carefully about

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.495
where we start. We don't want to start with a

00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:07.030
start_quote because that would include the double quote in the url.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.660
We just want the url not including the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.436
double quote, so we're going to start with the

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:13.390
start_quote plus 1. And we're going to go from

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.010
there until the end_quote. We don't want to include the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.390
closing double-quote. We don't include that one in the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.870
string. So we don't need to subtract 1 from

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.620
the end_quote. And that will get us the url,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.460
extracted from the first link on the web page.
