00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.648
To shift our graph to the right by 3, we need to replace x in the original

00:00:03.648 --> 00:00:08.904
equation for the original graph, with x minus 3. So we end up with f of x

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:13.798
equals the quantity x minus 3, squared. Now you also could of course write y

00:00:13.798 --> 00:00:16.248
equals the quantity x minus 3 squared.
