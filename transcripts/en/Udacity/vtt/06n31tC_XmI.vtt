00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
This table here is taken from a survey by Tobias Riege and Jorg Rothe.

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:09.180
I had chose the development of better and better algorithms for 3-SAT

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.700
So up here, you can see the deterministic algorithms for 3-SAT

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.430
and down here you can see randomized algorithms for 3-SAT

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.728
and you can see how over the years the algorithms

00:00:18.728 --> 00:00:22.130
get better and better and better and the same thing over here.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.529
Now, this is of course going to be a rather easy question,

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.200
but which of these two algorithm categories generally seems to be better

00:00:29.200 --> 99:59:59.000
Is it the deterministic algorithms up here or the randomized algorithms down here.
