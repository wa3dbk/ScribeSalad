Before we end this lesson, I want to draw several connections.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.450
The first has to do with memory. We have often said that memory is an integral

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.860
part of the cognitive systems architecture. One can imagine that A and

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.436
B are stood in a memory. Then C and 1, and C and 2, and C and 3, and so

00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:26.920
on, are probes into the memory. And the question would then become,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.260
which one of these probes is most similar to what's stored in memory?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.220
We may decide on that answer based on some similarity metric.

00:00:36.418 --> 00:00:40.810
In fact we'll revisit this exactly the same issue when we talk about case-based

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.040
reasoning later on in this class. Another connection we can draw here has to do

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.200
with reasoning. When we are talking about the transformation from A to B and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.320
then the transformation to from C to 1 of these choices, one question that arose

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.200
was should we make the connection between the outer circle here and B?

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.920
Or the inner circle and A and B. This is a correspondence problem.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.970
The correspondence problem is: given two situations, what object in one

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.540
situation corresponds to what object in another situation? We will come

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.110
across this problem again when we discuss analogical reason a little bit later.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.230
The third connection has to do with cognition, of knowledge based AI as a whole.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.530
Notice that instead of just talking about properties of objects,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.320
like this is a circle and the size of the circle,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.400
our emphasis here has been on the relationships between the objects.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.780
The fact that this is inside the outer circle, or the fact that the outer circle

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.350
remains the same here, the inner circle disappears. In knowledge-based AI and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.600
in cognition in general, the focus is always on relationships,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.280
not just on objects and the features of those objects.
