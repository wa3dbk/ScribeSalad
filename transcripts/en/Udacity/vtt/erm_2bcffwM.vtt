00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.550
Here we have our data from our caffeine and reaction time experiment. The

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.240
caffeine group is called the experimental group and the no-caffeine group is

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.300
called the placebo or control group. We just mention the mean, which is another

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.450
statistical tool that we use in psychological experiments. The mean is the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.080
average of all scores. So for our caffeine and reaction time experiment we took

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.200
each individuals reaction time and got an average. So for our experimental

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.790
group the average or mean score on reaction time was 0.3527 seconds. And for

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.810
our control or placebo group, our average reaction was 0.5621. So what does

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.960
this difference mean? We ran another statistical test and we found that the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.810
difference between the experimental group and the control group was

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.590
statistically significant. But what does that mean? It means that it is highly

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.880
unlikely that the scores we observed were due by chance. So again in this

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.430
caffeine and reaction study we can say the signicant difference between point

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.670
three and point five seconds occurred most likely because of the caffeine and

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.759
not because of some other variable.
