00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.910
So we said that the SMT processor
is not that much more expensive

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.940
than a single threaded processor that
has the same issue within everything.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.040
Let's see what the hardware changes for
SMT look like so

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.160
that we can convince ourselves that it's
indeed not that much more expensive.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.560
In a normal processor, we would have
a program counter that we use to access

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.430
the instruction cache to
fetch our instructions.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.430
Because this is a super
scalar processor,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.720
we are fetching more than just one
instruction with this program counter.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.370
Then we get into a decoder that
is capable of decoding multiple

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.150
instructions per cycle.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.810
Then a renamer that gets to read and
update the RAT for this thread.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.790
And once the instructions is renamed it
gets to the reservation stations, and

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.220
then from here we send the instructions
for execution, and in our ROB,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.770
we need to track what's the next
committed instruction from this thread.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.700
So if we want to add the ability
to simultaneously multi-thread

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.810
another thread here.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.600
We definitely need a separate PC here.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.010
And we need a logic that will
fetch from these two PCs.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.670
We could do this every cycle we fetch,
from both of the PCs,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.960
half of the instructions.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.831
Or we can actually do one cycle fetch
everything you can from this PC,

00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:28.720
one cycle fetch everything
you can from this PC.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.920
So SMT usually refers to
what's happening here,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.170
but here we could actually be doing fine
grain multithreading as far as fetching

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.470
is concerned.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.735
Most processors that do SMT
actually do it that way.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:47.950
Decoding is completely oblivious to
where the instructions came from.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.850
So we don't really need to change
anything about our decoding logic.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.610
The renamer, does the same thing
regardless of where the instruction came

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.010
from, except that the RATs
accesses needs to be different.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.480
So now we have two RATs,
one for each thread.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.919
That we need to access depending
on what we're renaming.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.820
After renaming, instructions got
separate physical registers for

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.870
each thread.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.590
So the reservation stations
are simply shared by the two threads.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.170
The execution units get to execute
the operations with the values

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.330
they are given so they have no clue
where the instruction really came from.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.000
And then when we get to the ROB,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.230
we need to either have a separate ROB
with its own commit point in which case

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.120
each of the threads gets to
commit each instruction in order.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.070
Or we actually put all the instructions
in interleaved order in the ROB,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.150
in which case we will not be
able to commit an instruction

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.660
from one thread until all
the instructions from it and

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.740
the other thread that
preceded have been committed.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.390
Because the ROB is a large In complex
piece of hardware, typically we don't do

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.940
this and we actually suffer, here,
by just committing the threads together.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.240
But if we have sent the instructions, in
order, to the reservation stations and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.040
their ROB, then the order in
the ROB is still the correct order.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.430
It's just at sometimes we could have
committed a instruction from one thread,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.330
but we have to wait for the other
thread to also commit some instructions

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.730
before that, so it's slightly less
optimal, but still works fine.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.170
The thing that happens at commit though,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.570
is that we deposit the results into
the architectural register file.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.100
And also when we send instructions for
execution, we send it along with

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.610
the data, that comes from the ARF,
our threads do have different registers.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.110
Our zero here is not
the same as our zero here.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.390
So we need a separate ARF and a separate
path to each of the ARFs here and

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.030
also the separate read ports here.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.890
So as you can see,
the complexity largely

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.740
lies in having multiple pieces and being
able to fetch from either of them and

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.030
in the logic that immediately
precedes the reservation stations.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.720
But the really complicated part of
the processor which is the reservation

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.850
stations, the broadcast of results and
so on, stays the same.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.780
So this is why the cost is not
twice the cost of the processor.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.600
Most of the cost of the processor
is in the cache right here,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.670
the complex hardware here, the large
ROB where you can insert things and

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.120
wait for them to finish and so on and
commit, and also the data cache.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.013
And what you're really adding is another
PC here, same size cache as before,

00:04:36.013 --> 00:04:40.680
another RAT, another ARF, but
keep the complex part alone.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.000
So that's why the cost is not very,
very high.
