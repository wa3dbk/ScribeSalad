00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.390
So now that you've written your first Python program, you might

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.850
be wondering why we need to invent new languages like Python to

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.530
program computers and spend all the effort into learning a new

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.380
language, rather than using some language like English or Mandarin that we

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.600
already know. And there lots of reasons for that. That natural

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.510
languages like English and Mandarin are great for people who grew up

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.770
speaking them for day-to-day conversation. But there are many reason that

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.300
they wouldn't work well for programming computers. The first one is ambiguity.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.570
Natural languages are inherently ambiguous. Different people can interpret

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.210
the same sentence to mean many different things. When

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.220
we program computers, the computer needs to interpret that

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.400
program. And we want to make sure that the computer

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.300
interprets the program the exact same way that the

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.920
programmer, who wrote the program, intends for it to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.790
be interpreted. So here's an example of the kinds

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.020
of ambiguities that come up in natural languages like English,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.700
and we'll do this in the form of a quiz. So the question is, would you rather be

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.490
paid $100 weekly or biweekly? So these are the choices, you can

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.280
prefer to be paid $100 weekly; you can prefer to be paid $100 biweekly. It

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.570
depends, or you are an altruist and you don't like to be paid at all
