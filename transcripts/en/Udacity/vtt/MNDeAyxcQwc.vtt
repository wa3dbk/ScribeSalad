00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:02.257
We'll take advantage of what 
the framework offers

00:00:02.257 --> 00:00:04.534
in order to build our SettingsActivity.

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:06.820
Since we're supporting 
Gingerbread devices,

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.772
we'll use a preference activity class.

00:00:08.772 --> 00:00:10.528
If you're targeting Honeycomber later,

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:12.985
you'll want to use 
the PreferenceFragment class.

00:00:13.098 --> 00:00:16.923
Create a new SettingsActivity class 
from the gist provided below.

00:00:17.303 --> 00:00:21.205
Update the AndroidManifest 
to declare this new activity.

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:25.550
You can see the way detail activity 
is declared as an example.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.273
If you see that APIs are deprecated, 
that's okay. That's a side effect

00:00:29.273 --> 00:00:34.014
of using PreferenceActivity, 
in order to target Gingerbread devices.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.799
When you create your app 
for your final project,

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:40.977
you can use the wizard in Android Studio
to create a new SettingsActivity.

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:44.573
The code the wizard provides 
will make your app backward compatible,

00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:47.159
by using a combination 
of preference activity

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.087
and PreferenceFragment.

00:00:49.087 --> 00:00:51.668
Our gist is meant to be 
a simplified version of that

00:00:51.668 --> 00:00:55.073
for learning purposes. So later, 
you'd be able to understand better

00:00:55.073 --> 00:00:56.763
what the wizard is doing.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.784
Check these items off 
when you're done.
