For a, we'll get this expression. Great work if you got that one correct. We can

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.914
do this problem by cross multiplying. So, we'll have negative 7 times 2a minus

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:15.826
3, and 6 times 2a times b. Cross multiplying is really true, though, because

00:00:15.826 --> 00:00:19.971
we're multiplying both sides by the least common denominator, negative 42. It

00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:24.992
would be the product of these two numbers. We know negative 42 divided by 6

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:30.552
equals negative 7. So we're really left with a negative 7 in our numerator, and

00:00:30.552 --> 00:00:35.572
we multiply it by 2a minus 3. Something similar happens on the right, negative

00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:40.726
42 divided by negative 7 is 6. So we're left with 12ab. Next we need to

00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:46.308
distribute this negative 7 to each of these terms. So we'll have negative 14a,

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:51.338
plus 21 equals 12ab. Remember what we're doing here, we're solving for a, so

00:00:51.338 --> 00:00:55.637
let's get this a term over to the right side, so we have two a terms together.

00:00:55.638 --> 00:01:00.335
We add 14a to both sides to get this equation. These terms both share an a,

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:05.512
which is what we are solving for. So we factor the a out, leaving us with 12b

00:01:05.512 --> 00:01:11.872
times 14. Finally, we divide both sides by this expression to solve for 1a.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:18.558
These two factors reduce to 1, leaving us with a equals 21 divided by 12b plus

00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:18.929
14.
