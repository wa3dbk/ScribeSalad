00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.160
Well, we know the ladder is 17 feet long. So we'll have 17 for this distance of

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.400
the ladder. We know that the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.060
house or the building is 7 feet less, than the distance from the top of the

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.134
ladder to the ground. So we know that this distance is 7 units less than this

00:00:19.134 --> 00:00:24.008
distance. Since we don't know this distance, we can use the variable x. And

00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:27.302
then we can write the expression x minus 7 for the distance from the base of

00:00:27.302 --> 00:00:32.374
the ladder to the base of the building. This is how we get this number and

00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:37.203
these two expressions. Great work if you found all 3.
