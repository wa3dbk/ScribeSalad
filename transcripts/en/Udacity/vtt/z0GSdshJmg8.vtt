00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.450
In this lesson we will look at Pyretic

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.450
which is an SDN language, and run time that

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.860
implements some of the composition operators that we

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.250
discussed in the last lesson. The language is a

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.820
way of expressing these high level policies, and

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.520
the run time provides the function of compiling these

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.970
policies. So, the OpenFlow rules that are eventually are

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.380
installed on the switches. One key abstraction in Pyretic

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.360
is the notion of located packets. The idea that we can apply a policy based on

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.590
a packet and it's location, in a network.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.020
Such as the switch, at which that packet is

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.540
located or the port on which that packet

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.290
arrives. Pyretic offers several features. The first is, the

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.630
ability to take as input a packet, and

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.220
then return packets at different locations in the network.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.270
This effectively allows the implementation of network

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.320
policy as a function, that simply takes packets

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.120
and returns other packets at different locations.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.130
The second feature of Pyredic is the notion

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.190
of Boolean predicates. Unlike open flow rules,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.590
which do not permit the expression of simple

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.800
conjunctions such as and, and or, or negations

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.310
like not. Pyredic allows the expressions of policies

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.420
in terms of these predicates. Pyredic also provides

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.080
the notion of virtual package header fields. Which

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.810
allows the programmer to refer to packet locations

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.120
and also to tag packets so that specific

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.050
functions can be applied at different portions of

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.900
the program. Pyretic also provides composition operators, such

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.150
as parallel and sequential composition, which we discussed

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.440
in the last lesson. The notion of network

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.002
policy as a function contrasts with the

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:47.850
Open Flow style of programming. In OpenFlow,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.750
policies are simply bit patterns. In other

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.550
words, match statements for which matching packets are

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.990
subject to a particular action. These types

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.190
of policies can be particularly difficult to

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.890
reason about. In contrast, in Pyretic, policies

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.690
are functions that map packets to other packets.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.910
Some example functions in Pyretic include the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.450
identify function, which returns the original packet,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.090
none or drop, which returns the empty

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.850
set, match which returns the identity if the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:26.430
field f matches the value v and returns none or drop otherwise. Mod, which

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.020
returns the same packet with the field f set to v. Forward, which is simply

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.100
syntactic sugar on mod. To say that, the

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.050
output port field in the packet should be

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.470
modified to the parameter specified and flood which

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.860
returns one packet for each port on the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.620
network spanning tree. In open flow, packets either

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.840
match on a rule, or they simply fall

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.600
through to the next rule. So, or, not,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.180
Ect can be tough to reason about. In contrast,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.090
peretics match function outputs either the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.620
packet or nothing, depending on whether the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.710
predicate is satisfied. For example, we could

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.890
apply a match statement that says match

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.190
destination IP equals ten zero zero three.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.680
And this function would take packets as

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.340
input and only return packets that satisfy

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.380
this particular predicate. In addition to the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.430
standard packet header fields, Pyretic offers the notion

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.880
of virtual packet header fields, which is a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.290
unified way of representing packet metadata. In Pyretic,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.010
the packet is nothing more than a dictionary that

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.480
maps a field name such as the destination

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.570
IP address to a value. Now, these field names

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.570
could correspond to fields in an actual packet

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.120
header. But they can also be virtual. For example,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.270
we could provide a match statement based

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.070
on a switch, indicating that we only want

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.870
to return packets that are located at a particular switch or on the input port,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.090
indicating that we only want c packets

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.080
whose attributes match a particular input port. The

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.650
match function matches on this packet meta-data

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.525
and the mod function can modify this meta-data.
