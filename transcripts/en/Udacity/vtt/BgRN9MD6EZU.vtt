00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.953
I'd like you to identify the types of matrices these are. Your four choices are

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:08.401
translate, rotate, rotate then translate, and scale. When you figure out what a

00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:12.604
matrix is, put the appropriate number in the box. Each transform will be used

00:00:12.604 --> 00:00:13.070
one time.
