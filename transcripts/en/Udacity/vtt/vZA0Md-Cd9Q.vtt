00:00:00.088 --> 00:00:02.860
Now I want to conclude this discussion on refactoring by telling you

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.190
when you should not refactor. One first clear case is when

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.410
your code is broken. I want to make it very clear, refactoring

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.450
is not a way to fix your code in terms of its

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.250
functionality. It's a way to improve the design of your code.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.040
So if your code does not compile or does not run

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.780
in a stable way, it's probably better to throw it away

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.250
and rewrite it rather then trying to refactor it. By definition refactoring

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.780
should maintain the functionality of the

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.360
system. It should be behavior preserving.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.100
So if the code was broken before, it, it's probably going to be broken

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.950
afterwards as well. You may also want to avoid refactoring when a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.370
deadline is close. Well, first of all, because refactoring might take a long

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.360
time and therefore might introduce risks of being late for the deadline.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.555
And also, because of what we said before about introducing problems, you don't

00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:47.780
want to introduce problems that might take you time to fix right before a

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.660
deadline. So if the deadline is too close, you might want to avoid

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.310
refactoring the code at that point. And finally, do not refactor if there

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.430
is no reason to. As we said before, you should refactor on demand. You

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.960
see a problem with the design of your code, with the structure of your

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.790
code, it's okay to refactor. If the code is fine, there is no reason

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.470
to refactor. I know that refactoring is fine, but you don't want to do

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.280
it all the time. The next thing I want to discuss, after discussing when

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.970
not to refactor, is when to refactor without an indication that will tell us

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.820
that it's time to refactor the code. And that leads us to the discussion

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.280
of a very interesting concept.
