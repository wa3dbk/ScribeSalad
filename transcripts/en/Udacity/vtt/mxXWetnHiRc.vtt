[MUSIC]

00:00:15.755 --> 00:00:24.147
Put this piece here and
then take this one and put it here.

00:00:24.147 --> 00:00:27.040
Hi there.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.850
Have you ever felt like building
a web application is like making

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.180
something with tiny pieces and
no instructions at all?

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.120
JavaScript is flexible, so is the don
which makes browser application

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.440
development feel like assembling
a million tiny pieces.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.200
You don't have to do this alone though.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.750
Front end frameworks such as Backbone,
Angular, and Ember

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.110
handle the common details so you can
focus on what makes your app special.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.790
So welcome, I'm Richard Kalehoff,
a course developer at Udacity and

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.600
a front end application developer.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.640
I'm excited that you've decided
to come on this journey with me.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.930
Let's discover the amazing capability
that front end frameworks provide us

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.350
developers.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.160
In this course we'll be taking
a look at the major features

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.250
of client side single page
applications and some SPA frameworks.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.480
We'll work our way up from Backbone_
then build the applications

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.580
with other popular frameworks.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.550
By the way, people have asked
us why we're not covering react.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.440
React is an incredibly popular library
for quickly updating the dom, but

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.070
it only really handles the view,
not the whole application.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.300
We're focusing on the complete
application framework.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.570
Once you've completed this course,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.760
you'll be in a great
place to learn react.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.570
When you finish this course,
what will you be able to do?

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.050
You'll be able to slip right into
working with popular job script

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.870
frameworks.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.990
And you'll also be able to evaluate
frameworks to see if they meet the needs

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.910
of your new project.
