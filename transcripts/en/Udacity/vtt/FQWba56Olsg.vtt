00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.843
Now we are ready to put all the subs together to get an answer. How many

00:00:02.843 --> 00:00:07.766
circles fits in a field that is 1900m wide and 4000m long. You can use any of

00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:12.320
the information you have calculated so far, the total number of rows was 5. The

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.496
number of columns in an even row was 1. And the number of columns in an odd row

00:00:16.496 --> 00:00:21.555
was 2. The number of even rows was 2, and the number of odd rows was 3. If you

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:26.354
are getting stuck, think about how many of each type of row there are? And how

00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:28.489
many circles are in that type of row?
