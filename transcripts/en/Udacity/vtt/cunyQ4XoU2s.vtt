00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.295
Keep in mind that for responsive images, like adaptive

00:00:03.295 --> 00:00:06.230
layout that we learned about in the last few lessons,

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.720
we frequently will want to adapt the size of the

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.770
image, the layout size of the image, depending on how

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.350
much space we have. Sometimes we do that with

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.110
simple scaling, for example, here, on our conference app, we're

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.400
currently rescaling the speaker images depending on the layout size.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.950
Sometimes though, we may actually want to switch between subjectively

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.220
different images too. For example, you might want to crop your subject

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.090
more closely when you don't have as much space to render the image.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.890
Using images differently in terms of

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.000
art direction in different scenarios is part

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360
of what makes these responsive images

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.600
rather then just scalable pixel ratio images.
