00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.290
Before 1994, addresses was divided into a Network ID

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.570
portion and a Host ID portion. So if we

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.970
take our 32-bits, suppose the first bit is a

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.990
0. Note that, that's half of all IPv4 address

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.710
space. Anything that starts with a 0 is going

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.100
to be known as a class A address and

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.750
the next 7 bits will represent the network ID

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.800
or the network that owns this portion of address space.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.640
The remainging portion Of the address space is

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.920
dedicated for hosts on that network. In this case,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.810
any class A network can support up to

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.940
two to the twenty-fourth posts. Addresses that started with

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.630
one zero were designated as class B networks,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.700
where the first 16 bits signified the Network ID

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.040
and the remaining 16 bits signified the Host

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.880
ID for that network. Note here that each class

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.120
B address range represents about one sixty-five thousandth of of

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.770
all internet address space. So, discounting the first two bits which indiciate

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.430
that this is a class B network, we have about 2 to the 14th, unique class B's.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.326
Each of which can have two to the sixteenth, or 65,000

00:01:11.326 --> 00:01:16.140
hosts on each network. Class C's use the first

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.790
24 bits for the Net ID and a remaining eight for a Host ID. So each class C

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.810
network essentially can only have 255 hosts on it. This plot shows the BGP

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.510
routing table size as a function of the year, starting in 1989, and going up to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.225
1994. You can see that at this time,

00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:41.260
the internet routing table is quite small. It started,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.390
at less than 5,000 prefixes. By comparison now

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.940
we have about 500,000 IP prefixes in the internet

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.630
routing table. But we can see in this

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.440
period, that internet routing table growth began to accelerate,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.120
in particular the growth rates were exceeding the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.950
advances in hardware and software capabilities. And, in particular,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.080
we began to run out of the class

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.560
C address allocation. There were far more networks that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.008
needed just a handful of IP addresses, such

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.080
as a class C address space could provide. And

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.220
yet because only a certain range of the IP

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.040
address space could be used for class C addresses

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.330
we began to run out fairly quickly. So there

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.050
began to be a need for more flexible allocation.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.240
The solution to this problem is something called classless

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.850
interdomain routing, or CIDR. Something that we'll cover in

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.450
the next lesson.
