00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay. Back here, check off another bird.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Just one left. Well, okay, I lied. It's not quite one left.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There is also scoring we'll have to do next, but one left for this part.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So all plays, like horizontal plays, takes a hand and the board.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What should it return? Well, it's going to be a set, the position in which we start the word.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well, that can be the same as before, an i-j position is perfectly good.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, we're also going to have some words going across and some words going down.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now, we want our results to be a three tuple.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's a set of an ij position followed by a direction--across or down,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
followed by a word, a set of those.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now onto the all_plays function--takes a hand in the board,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
it's going to return all plays in both directions on any square

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
so the play is a position, direction, and a word where the position is an ij pair,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
j picked up row number, i the column number.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Direction is either across or down, and those will just be global variables.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We don't have to decide for now how to represent it.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I used a trick here--I said all the horizontal plays, the cross plays,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we get from calling horizontal plays directly on the hand in the board.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The vertical plays--I didn't have to write a separate function.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
All I have to do is transpose the board--flop the i and the j, call horizontal plays on that,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and that gives me a set of results, but they're the results in the wrong direction.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They're ji pairs rather than ij pairs.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Now your task is write the code to put that all together

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to take these two sets, one of them is in reversed order, so they have to be swapped around.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Neither set has a direction associated with it.

00:01:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Assemble them all into the resulting set that should be returned by all plays.
