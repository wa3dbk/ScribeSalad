That was a more difficult problem. If you got negative 3 or negative 1 5th,

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:08.638
congratulations. I would say that you have mastered absolute value equations.

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:13.032
Let's see how we got those answers. When I have two absolute values that are

00:00:13.044 --> 00:00:17.476
equal to each other, I still have to make two cases. And the two cases for this

00:00:17.488 --> 00:00:22.015
problem are going to be 3 x plus 2 equals, the first case is going to be exactly

00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:26.885
what's inside the absolute value, which is 2 x minus 1. The second case, we keep

00:00:26.897 --> 00:00:31.340
the left side of the equation the same and make the right-hand side of the

00:00:31.352 --> 00:00:35.888
equation negative, so I have negative 2 x minus 1. Let's go ahead and solve

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.300
these. First I subtract 2 x from both sides. When I subtract 2 x from both

00:00:40.312 --> 00:00:45.370
sides, I get x plus 2 equals negative 1. And when I subtract 2 from both sides,

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:50.720
I get x equals negative 3. So, there's one of my answers. we have to be a little

00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:55.595
more careful here. I have negative parentheses, 2 x minus 1, which means

00:00:55.607 --> 00:01:02.002
negative 1 times 2 x minus 1. Which means I need to distribute that negative

00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:08.441
sign. Negative 1 times 2 x is negative 2 x, and negative 1 times negative 1 is

00:01:08.453 --> 00:01:14.509
positive 1. From here, I'm going to add 2 x to both sides, which gives me 5 x

00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:19.293
plus 2 equals 1. When I subtract 2 from both sides, I get 5 x equals negative 1.

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:23.992
Divide both sides by 5, and I get x equals negative 1 5th. That problem was more

00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:28.616
difficult then a lot of the absolute value equations. So, if you got the answer

00:01:28.628 --> 00:01:33.190
right, I'd say you've mastered absolute value equations. And, we're ready to

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:35.518
move on to absolute value inequalities.
