00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So here's how I chose to do it.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I first picked out the first pair,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and if there are 2 pairs, that should be the highest,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
because remember, the ranks are ordered from highest to lowest,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
so if I'm going through the ranks from left to right,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I should hit the highest one first.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And then to find if there's a low pair,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
what I've done is reverse the ranks

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and then look through those, so now I'm going from

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
lowest to highest, and I should find the lowest pair first.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now if I found a pair, and I found a low pair,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which is not equal to the pair, then I want to return the two of them.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Otherwise I just return none.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So congratulations.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We've gone through the whole program.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We've come up with a solution,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and now when we hit the Run button,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
it prints out "tests pass," so we've done everything

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that we promised to do, and it works okay.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But I'm still not confident because

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I know we've done some tests, but we haven't done exhaustive tests yet,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so I feel pretty good about it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You should feel good about what we've done together.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Congratulations on that.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But don't feel like we're done yet.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We've still got to come up with more tests

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to prove that we've got it right in every case,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and in fact, I want to share with you a test that somebody pointed out to me

00:01:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that I hadn't thought of at all.
