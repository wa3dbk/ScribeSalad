00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.010
And that brings us to financial resources, is how are we going to get this start-up off the ground?

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.550
If you're doing a web, mobile, ??? seem quite possible

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.090
that you could get the company started with your credit cards, friends and family,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.350
crowdfunding like quick starter, local angels that is investors

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.640
who are not professional venture capitalists, but might make some small investments.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.480
Again, if all you  need is a laptop and Amazon Web Services account,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.850
you could be up and running developing an app

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.530
but just keep in mind that when you're asked to do the financial calculations,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.220
there might be great to actually code the app but how are you going to create

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.690
customer relationships and get, keep, and grow your business,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.290
and so financial resources actually gets you back to thinking about other demand creation activities

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.650
in customer relationships and the cost of your channel as well,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.930
so while you could get started here, it's interesting to start pre-computing

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.140
what other amounts of capital I will need later on in the life cycle of my company.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.220
If if you have something in a physical channel or something in the enterprise

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.470
that requires millions of dollars, I just thought, you're more than likely

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.630
to approach venture capital firms or corporate partners,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.060
so not only can you get money from corporate partners,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.270
from the United States, there's some government financing that's available that

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:30.340
??? coming from a university, the first place I would ??? what are called, SBIR or STTR grants

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.650
and later be as large as half a million dollars to commercialize your company or your technology.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.740
Also, the small business administration in the United States offers grants

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.970
to small businesses to start their companies.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.470
In your country, there might be the equivalent of government fund.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.740
Now, once your start-up is up and running and you're generating orders and revenue,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.130
there are some other alternatives, so for example, you might be able to go to a bank

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.760
and hand them finance, the lease of expensive physical equipment.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.440
You're buying tons of computers or vehicles or manufacturing a ???.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.009
You might actually be able to get what's called the lease lines, so you don't have to pay cash for them.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.020
The second is if you actually have purchase orders from customers,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.020
but these customers don't pay for an extended period of time,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.790
60, 90, 180 days, you could actually take those confirmed purchase orders

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.890
to keep what's called factors and factors make a business

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.000
out of kind of lending you money on that purchase order at a discount.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.080
And so if you need cash, factoring is a normal part of financing in certain industries ???

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.410
And then finally, if you're buying expensive component,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.250
typically hardware in building your system, the vendor clearly wants to sell that equipment to you

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.930
but you might not have that cash upfront or cash is more important than your mother right now

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.810
and your start-up, and so you're trying to conserve it.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.750
You sometimes can actually get a venture to finance or defer or loan you

00:02:59.750 --> 99:59:59.000
the money to buy their own ??? and that's another way to kind of preserve your financial resources.
