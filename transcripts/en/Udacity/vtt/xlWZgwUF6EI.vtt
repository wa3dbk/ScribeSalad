00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.240
So we can measure performance as either latency or throughput.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.880
Let's see now, how do we compare performance of two

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.510
different systems. So we want to be able to say

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.010
something like system X is N times faster than system

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.540
Y. And the way we usually refer to this statement

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.020
is that the speedup of X over Y is equal

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.640
to N. So we compute N as the speed of X divided by speed of Y, and now it starts

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.280
to matter whether we have latency as our

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.142
measure of speed or throughput. For throughput N

00:00:32.142 --> 00:00:35.310
can be computed simply as the throughput of

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.038
X divided by throughput of Y, but for

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.206
latency, speed of X is not proportional to

00:00:41.206 --> 00:00:44.800
the latency effects. The longer the latency, the

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.700
lower the speed. So what we do instead, is we divide the latency of Y by the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.220
latency of X to get the speedup of X over Y.
