The next step I'd like you take is to simplify within each side of the equation.

00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:09.240
So carry out this multiplication and then combine like terms. Do not however,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.942
yet, do anything that changes both sides of the equation. Just simplify within

00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:14.575
each side.
