00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.640
So let's discuss some examples of VLIW processor.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.642
The most famous example of how to probably not

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:10.300
do VLIW is Intel's Itanium processors. It has

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.970
tons of ISA features that help the compiler schedule

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.180
code well, etcetera. As a result, the hardware

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.250
of the processor became very complicated. It no longer

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.436
needed to check for dependencies between instructions, but it

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:25.442
had so many other bells and whistles to do

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.215
this that the hardware is probably the most complicated

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.760
Intel ever belt. And yet fundamentally this is still

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.220
a VLIW processor, so it's still not doing great

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.000
on your regular code. Another example of where VLIW

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.550
is often used is DSP processors. What DSP stands

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.240
for, digital signal processing. Digital signal processing does a

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.520
lot of floating point work, typically in a very

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.510
regular loop with a very small amount of work within

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.908
each iteration and lots of, lots of iterations. So

00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:56.916
typically, these types of processors on these types of

00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:59.988
codes get excellent performance and are also very energy

00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:03.316
efficient, because they don't spend much power on figuring

00:01:03.316 --> 00:01:07.078
out dependencies and so on. So these are examples

00:01:07.078 --> 00:01:09.444
of when we try to use VLIW for all

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:13.155
types of codes, we run into problems. But if

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:15.634
we find the type of codes where compilers can

00:01:15.634 --> 00:01:19.620
do well, suddenly VLIW looks like a very, very good choice for that.
