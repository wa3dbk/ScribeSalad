00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.554
We initially set, balance to 100, and target to 200. But target won't change,

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:09.008
so I wont write that down over here. Rate also wont change. The year, starts at

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:13.774
0. Now we compare the balance to the target. The balance is 100, and the target

00:00:13.774 --> 00:00:20.070
is 200. 100 is not greater than or equal to 200. So we don't go into the body

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.571
of the loop. We skip down to the bottom. We never output anything. What would

00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:28.103
you say the bug in this code is? How would you fix it? I won't go over this,

00:00:28.103 --> 00:00:30.300
but if you're not sure, maybe try it out in BlueJ.
