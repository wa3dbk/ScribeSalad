00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.688
To parse the date column, we're going to be using D3's built-in time

00:00:05.688 --> 00:00:10.430
formatting accessed through d3.time.format and similar to

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.570
the time format extreme we used in our dimple.js code for d3's formatting.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.630
We give it a similar string, which uses strftime variables.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.645
In this case, the things here, which are preceded by a percent.

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:33.300
%d-%m-%Y and so forth, which each correspond to a day,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.000
month, year or time format.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.720
And then d3 simply pattern matches the pattern we told it to expect our

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.880
dates in.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.770
And the actual date string.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.110
Here I've put an example of the format of dates in our data file where we have

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.800
the day as a two digit integer, a dash, the month as a two digit integer.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.740
A dash, the year as a four digit integer and then the hour and

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.050
minute of the day contained within these parentheses.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.450
So going to our format string, percent d corresponds to a two digit day.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.490
The dash corresponds to a dash.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.960
And since we don't want it to actually.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.480
Pull out the dash into the date object that gets returned.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.555
It simply skips over that.

00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:25.780
%M corresponds to the two digit month.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.875
A dash simply says skip the dash.

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:35.230
%Y matches a four digit year and then we have a space

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.660
left parenthesis two digit hour between zero and 23,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.790
a colon, and then a two digit minute, and then rest, a space, H,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.790
and right parenthesis, are simply the trail of the string.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.350
And to use this formatting, we simply, on the format object,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.230
call the parse function and pass in the string we'd like to convert.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.760
In this case, D bracket date corresponds to some string

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.330
that'll look similar to this that I've shown here as an example date.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.540
Gets patterned matched to extract the appropriate day, month, year and time.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.790
And then we restore that in the date column.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.190
So in this case we're over writing the data column which is

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.470
a string initially here, with a date java script object.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.120
One little nuance that I feel I should mention is that the time of the game is

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.110
actually the local time of the country where the game's held.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.730
Or for simplicity.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.450
And since, for a single year or a single World Cup

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.610
we only care about the relative times of each game, we can simplify things and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.810
not worry about converting all of the local time zones across all of the years.
