00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.805
Let's think back way, way back to right triangles. Let's say that I have a right

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:09.292
triangle whose two shorter legs are both equal to the square root of 2 times x.

00:00:09.396 --> 00:00:14.122
What then, is the length of the hypotenuse of this triangle or the length of

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:18.827
this longest side? Be super careful about which factors are under the radical

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:19.120
sign.
