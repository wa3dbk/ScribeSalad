00:00:00.255 --> 00:00:05.090
We're going to briefly explore various modeling techniques.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.590
But to be able to build any type of model,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.600
we will need to first investigate the data.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.560
We will be following the same iterative process of writing down our questions,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.600
selecting features from the data that can best answer the questions,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.300
build models to get some answers, and using

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.090
validation techniques to determine the model that best answer the questions.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.720
Although we'll emphasize the process of model building,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.920
we will still keep iterating through the Q,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.630
M, V process, and use our diagrams to track our progress.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.140
Before we dive into a particular example problem,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.460
let's look at various approaches and techniques that we can use to build models.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.010
Let's look at some of the modeling techniques in use.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.999
One of the first techniques that comes to mind is mathematical models.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.910
They're usually useful in domains such as natural, social or economic sciences.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.930
The tools and concepts required to build mathematical models

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.780
involve differential and integral calculus,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.270
differential equations, algebra, and other advanced mathematics.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.710
The advantages of mathematical models is that they

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.700
can give generalized knowledge of systems.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.330
They also reduce complex phenomenon to simple cases, and we can use inductive

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.990
and deductive reasoning to gain knowledge about our system and the models.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.170
Another important technique of model building is statistical or

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.820
machine learning.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.730
They are applicable in industry, in businesses, and

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.470
in general cases where we don't have domain-specific knowledge.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.370
The tools and concepts required for

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.940
statistical machine learning models is a good knowledge of statistics,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.440
machine learning, linear algebra, and some information theory.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.210
The advantage of these models is that we can treat phenomenon in all its

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.200
complexity, and we can make inferences using computational power.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.200
In practice, we often use a combination of mathematical modeling techniques and

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.820
statistical and machine-learning techniques.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.500
These are applicable everywhere in science, as we mentioned, social and

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.780
economic sciences, business, engineering, as well as optimization problems.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.780
All the tools and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.650
concepts listed above can come in very useful to build these combination models.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.550
The advantage is that we can use whatever model we find necessary and

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.930
as per requirement to solve our problems.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.660
Hopefully, this table here gives you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.210
a general idea of where we use what sort of modeling technique.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.540
Although we're not going to cover mathematical models,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.860
we invite you to go through the tools and concepts required, and

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.730
approach some problem with mathematical models if need be.
