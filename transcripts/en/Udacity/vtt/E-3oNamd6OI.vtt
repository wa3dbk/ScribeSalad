00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.630
A key determinant of a successful review is how thoroughly

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.030
the participants examine the artifact. There are variety of means that have been

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.500
devised to encourage this thoroughness. Line by line coverage of, of the code or

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.910
the documents involved. similarly, if, if it's a, a diagram is being,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.530
reviewed or going through systematically on the visual elements of a diagram.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.790
If we're talking about the early stages, the requirements document,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.020
it may be the use cases, and making sure all the use cases are going through.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.360
Another technique for ensuring or promoting thoroughness comes at things from

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.810
a little bit different point of view. And this is a check list based reviews.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.210
The checklist is based on common def, types of defects, either derived from

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.610
common industrial practices, or company specific empirical data. So for example,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.930
if it's a code review there and the company has a history of problems with

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.370
correctly interfacing with libraries then it might be that you add a check list

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.770
for making sure that library interfaces are looked at a little bit more deeply.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.190
And one, one other one is coverage of verification conditions.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.550
This is kind of a specialized, checklist. Verification conditions

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.740
were invented as part of a clean room software engineering methodology by IBM.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.050
A verification condition is a rule that obtains in a particular situation. For

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.010
example, when a loop is encountered during a code review,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.450
a specific verification condition is to examine whether the loop is

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.870
guaranteed to terminate under all circumstances.
