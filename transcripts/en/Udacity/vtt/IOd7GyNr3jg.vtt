00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So let's go back to the search results we got when we search for Python in union

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we see the first hit goes to the Python documentation for sets

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and if we follow this we get to that documentation, but the first thing we see is that this is deprecated.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Deprecated means that this is something that the language no longer encourages you to use

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and will be eventually removed from the language, and so that's not what we should use.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We should use the one that it links to, which is the built-in subtype

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and now we see more information about sets.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's see what we get there, so we have a description of the set type

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and what is says is a set object is an unordered collection of hashable objects.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Well this also is something that probably doesn't make a lot of sense

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to students who've only taken 101, but let's see if you can figure out on your own what that means.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So here's what it says in the Python documentation.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The Python documentation is the definitive reference on Python,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but it's often not the easiest way to understand something new.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So your goal is to see if you can figure out what this means and if you can,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
you should be able to answer this quiz correctly.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So your goal is to understand what this means and if you can,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
you should be able to answer this quiz correctly, which is--which of these objects could be in a set?
