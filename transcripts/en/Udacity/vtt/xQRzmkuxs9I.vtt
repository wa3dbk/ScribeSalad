00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.200
Now, we can use this equation and make a substitution. We can replace the

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.114
quantity x squared with a different variable that we'll call u. So, here

00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:14.010
instead of having x squared, we'll have the value u and we'll square it. Here

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.942
we'll have minus 13 times u to the first power. Again, here replacing x squared

00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:25.068
with our substitution of u. We're turning our non quadratic equation into one

00:00:25.068 --> 00:00:29.554
that is quadratic. So now that we've got this quadratic, let's see if we can

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:33.955
solve it. What do you think are the solutions for this equation. Keep in mind

00:00:33.955 --> 00:00:38.710
that you're solving this equation for u. We aren't solving for x, which was the

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.880
original variable in our original equation. We'll come back to that later. When

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.150
you have the answers for u, enter them here. Good luck.
