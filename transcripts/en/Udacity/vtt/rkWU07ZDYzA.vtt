Welcome to lesson four. In this lesson you'll

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.910
learn how to investigate two variables, and you'll

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.910
learn how to visualize and quantify that relationship.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.130
You'll learn about data aggregation, conditional means, and

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.520
scatter plots. You'll also get to hear from

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.059
Moira about how she used some EDA techniques

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.820
and her work in perceived audience size. Let's

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.610
get this lesson started by hearing from Moira.
