00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.420
So now we've gone through the basics of javascript syntax: structuring and

00:00:04.432 --> 00:00:09.070
interacting with JSON data, and requesting data from a server. Now, we need to

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:13.695
talk about how to interface to the browser. More specifically, we need to talk

00:00:13.707 --> 00:00:17.865
about the DOM, or document object model. The DOM is an interface to the

00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:19.709
structure of an HTML.document,

00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:25.128
for example, the head or body element. The DOM allows us to access and modify

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.925
our HTML document dynamically, using Javascript. Our game is primarily going to

00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:34.706
exist within a single element, the canvas, which we'll get into later. But what

00:00:34.718 --> 00:00:39.545
this means is that we won't have a lot of reason to heavily access the DOM.

00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:44.406
In fact we're only going to need a few things. So let's take a look at a quick

00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:47.507
example. Let's say you want to validate whether a user has entered a valid

00:00:47.507 --> 00:00:54.206
password into an input field. Here's how you would do that using the DOM API in

00:00:54.218 --> 00:00:59.187
Javascript. You can see the basic HTML here with the form and the password

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.967
input and the submit button, and we have a script down here where we start

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.206
executing our javascript. First, we have this document.getElementById method.

00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:13.915
What this does is grab a DOM element of the given id. In this case, it's

00:01:13.927 --> 00:01:19.310
exampleForm, which is right here, so we would grab this entire form. When

00:01:19.322 --> 00:01:24.385
it's submitted, we run this function in here. Now, you don't really need to

00:01:24.397 --> 00:01:29.610
worry about the passwordRegex too much. We're interested in this part down

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:34.760
here. Now if the password doesn't match, then we create a new "p" tag element,

00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:40.217
assuming it doesn't already exist. We check if it exists by again using the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.863
document.getElementById method and checking for the ID "notify". If it doesn't

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:50.577
exist we use the document.createElement method specified at "p" tag. This

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:56.227
parameter is just the name of a type of element. For example p or form or

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:02.058
canvas. Now we set the text content of that p tag to this bit here and we set

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.001
the ID attribute to notify. That way, if we submit multiple times, we don't

00:02:08.013 --> 00:02:14.236
simply create a new p tag every single time. Finally, we grab a reference to the

00:02:14.248 --> 00:02:19.479
body tag, since the body element has an ID of body we can do that, and we

00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:24.282
append "notify" to the body. Now if we look at this in our browser, we can see

00:02:24.294 --> 00:02:28.985
we have an input form with a submit button and you can see our basic HTML down

00:02:28.997 --> 00:02:34.058
here. However, if we submit an incorrect password -- press submit -- we can see that

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.767
this pops up right here, which is the text that we set our p tag to. You can

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:43.729
also see that this p tag was created down here. With an idea of notify and the

00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:48.840
correct text. You'll also see that if we keep pressing Submit again, more p tags

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:51.621
don't get created, since we made that check.
