00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.670
So now let's take a quick look at
the report analytics gives for goals.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.551
So we want to go to the reporting tab,
scroll down to conversions, and

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:10.890
choose overview.

00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:19.605
And again, make sure that the date
is either set to be today's date or

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:21.360
include today's date.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.390
The default range is do to
end at yesterday's date.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.480
Then you can see,
click through goal screens.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.330
So I actually clicked on the show
recipe screen a couple times,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.420
but it was all within one session.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.790
So I have one goal completion.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.880
I didn't assign any
monetary value to it.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.670
I didn't set up my funnel visualization,
so I don't have much here.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.320
And I don't have any goal flow data yet.
