00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.008
To find the LCD of these three denominators, we want to find the highest power

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:10.032
of each factor that appears in any denominator. We know four is already a factor

00:00:10.032 --> 00:00:14.568
of eight, so we really just want to find the greatest common denominator for x

00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:20.024
and eight. The only common factors for x and eight are one, so we'll have x

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:25.193
times 1 times 8, which equals 8x, our lowest common denominator.
