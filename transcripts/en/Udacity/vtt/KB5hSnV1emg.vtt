00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.310
The first and most obvious of
all of the pricing strategies,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.150
is simply to have a paid apper game.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.077
This generally appears like it's
going to be a minimum amount of

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:16.565
revenue that you'll obtain, but
the outcome isn't always as clear.

00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:19.294
When you're deciding to do a paid app or
a paid game,

00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:22.891
make sure that the quality is extremely
high because people are going

00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:24.890
to expect this for this type of an app.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.460
If you're just testing out your MVP,
the minimum viable product,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.549
and you don't necessarily know where
it lies on the quality spectrum.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.410
Then you might want to choose
a different modulation method.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.490
With choosing a paid method, so

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.930
this is outright paid, it's best
to look at all of the different

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.970
types of similarly paid apps or games
to determine the best pricing strategy.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.120
This might vary from country to
country or from time of year.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.520
For instance, if you want to get
a lot of users very quickly and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.550
you're not too worried about
the return during the holidays,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.420
you might want to lower a price point.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.110
If it's during the summer and
you don't really see like a huge rush,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.090
maybe it's a better idea
to price it a bit more.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.270
Of course, having a paid app or

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.380
game doesn't mean that
you also can't have IAPs.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.250
Or ads.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.800
But, you have to be extremely
careful not to overdo it on

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.590
those types of things, because there can
be push back from your users or players.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.390
There is no best choice between
interstitials that deliver CPC or CPI.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.870
It really depends on what's
converting the best in the end.
