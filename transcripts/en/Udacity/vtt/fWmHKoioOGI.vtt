We know that i equals the square root of negative 1. This must mean that if we

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.400
square i then that means we would square the square root of negative 1. We know

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.294
that this power and this square root undo one another. So we would just be left

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:18.744
with negative 1. Knowing that i squared equals negative 1, wouldn't you think

00:00:18.744 --> 00:00:24.237
the square root of negative 4 times the square root of negative 9 would equal?

00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:26.479
Choose the best answer out of these.
