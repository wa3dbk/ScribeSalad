00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.843
Now, that you've had a definition of what a function is, let's look at some

00:00:03.843 --> 00:00:07.497
graphs of different equations and see if we can tell which of these are

00:00:07.497 --> 00:00:11.397
functions. So, remember that we defined a function as a relation between

00:00:11.397 --> 00:00:15.757
variables, where there's, at most, one output for a given input. And for all of

00:00:15.757 --> 00:00:20.998
these graphs, x is the input and y is the output. So, if we can't have more than

00:00:20.998 --> 00:00:25.273
one value of y for any given value of x, for any curve that represents a

00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:29.509
function, then which of these 6 graphs over here is not a function?
