00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.040
In Victor's screen cast,
we also saw him navigating by landmark.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.720
HTML5 introduced some new elements
which help us to find the semantics of

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.138
a region of the page rather than
of a single interactive element.

00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:15.730
These are .

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.811
This represents the main
content of a page.

00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:21.121
Typically there should
only be one main element,

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:25.740
since otherwise it raises the question
of which one is really the main, main.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.700
Header, this is either a page banner
like it is here, or else a grouping

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.910
element for any introductory content
at the start of any type of section.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.800
Footer, similarly a footer may be
either a page footer as it is here and

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.550
contain information about the page or
site.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.300
Or maybe a footer to
a particular section of a page

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.330
with extra information
about that section.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.770
Nav, this represents a section of a page
that links to other pages like the top

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.450
nav bar or to parts within
the page like a table of contents.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.160
Article, this is for self-contained
sections of content like a blog entry,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.860
news article or forum post.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.050
A handy test for an article is
whether its content would make sense

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.050
in another context such as cross-posting
a blog post to several different blogs.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.710
Section, this is a completely generic
section of a document or application.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.670
Since it doesn't really give much of
a clue as to what its content might be,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.300
we typically include
a heading inside as well.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.010
And aside, an aside represents any
content which is tangentially related

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.630
to the content around it.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.701
In the context of article like this
one this might be a little pull out or

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:37.326
sidebar.

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:40.722
Or in the context of a page it might
be a page sidebar containing some

00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:43.280
extra navigation or
information about the page.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.340
An aside will often be
rendered as a side bar.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.300
But for example, in a responsive layout,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.420
you might fill in a side below the main
content for small view port sizes.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.980
There's a very good chance that your
start sheet already contains classes

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.735
like header, navigation and so on.

00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:03.205
For example, you've got a header
a section which has a particular colour

00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:07.505
theme and a bottom border to delineate
it from the rest of your site.

00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:10.275
And you might want links in your
navigation section to look different

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:12.645
from links in the rest of the site.

00:02:12.645 --> 00:02:16.345
Using semantic elements, provides
a more terse way to express the same

00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:19.955
information while also potentially
providing more information for

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:20.805
screening ready users.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.010
While these elements don't have any
default styling beyond just having

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.110
display block by default, you can use
your stylesheet just as you would for

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.800
a class name to select for

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.560
these elements to make them
fit your site's design.
