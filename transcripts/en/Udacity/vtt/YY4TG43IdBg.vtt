00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.310
So there are lots more things we can do with

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.760
strings. The next one I am going to talk about, is

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.880
selecting sub-sequences from strings. So what we have seen so

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.500
far, we have used indexing, where we have a string,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.640
where we have our square bracket. We have some expression

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.880
that produces one number, and we have our closed square

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.760
bracket, and that gives us a one-character string. And whatever

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.160
position the number refers to in the string here. The other

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.310
thing we can do with square brackets is select

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.820
a sub-sequence of the string. Instead of just having

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.930
one expression here, what we can have is an

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.720
expression. This is also something that should evaluate to a

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.800
number, followed by a colon, followed by another expression.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.810
Both of these expressions are numbers. And this will

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.040
evaluate to a string, this is a subsequence of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.200
a characters in, the input string. So I called the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.090
string s, the value of this number will call

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.020
start, and the value of this number will call

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.120
stop. And what the result is, is a string

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.760
that's a subsequence of all the characters in s,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.570
and the string that we had here. Starting from

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.750
position start, so the number to the left of

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.580
the colon, and ending with position stop, but not

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.830
including that character. So it's going to really include the characters

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.270
from position start, up through stop minus 1. So this construct allows us

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.920
to select from any string A subsequence of continuous characters in that string.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.450
So, let's try an example in the Python interpreter.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.080
I'm going to initialize the variable word to be the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.820
string assume. And using the single index operator we

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.660
saw initially, we can select a character from word.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.370
So, if I select word index 3. That will

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.520
give us the fourth character, zero, one, two, three,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.680
which is u, and when we run that, we

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.310
see the result is u. With the new operation,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.680
that's the same as selecting word 3:4,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.260
that's going to select starting from position three, going

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.000
to just before position four. So that will end up being just the one letter u.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.574
Just to make this clear, if I selected

00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:14.820
3:3, there's no string there, that's just a

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.890
single empty string which prints out in a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.740
way we can't see it. There's no characters

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.430
between 3 and character 3. We'll go back to

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.824
just selecting index 3. I could select from position 4

00:02:27.824 --> 00:02:30.950
through position 6. That would give us a string which

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.552
is a subsequence of letters at position 4 and position

00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:36.380
5. So when we run this now we see the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.372
first one prints out to u. The second one prints

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:42.360
out me which is position 4 and position 5. The

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.850
last two characters in the word. I'll show you one

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.550
other thing we can do. Which is, leave one of

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.200
the sides of the colon empty. So it we did 4:

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.250
to the end, that will select from position 4 to the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.320
end. We don't need to actually count the characters to know

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.050
where the end is. So that will produce the same thing

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.610
as we did before. We can also leave nothing in front

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.520
of the colon. That will select from the beginning. So if

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.140
we do :2, that will select from position 0 up to

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.120
position 2, giving us the first two letters of the word, as. And we could

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.180
leave both sides blank, selecting word, [:],

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.640
with nothing on either side, well, it starts from the beginning, goes to the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.790
end. That's going to give us the whole word. There's

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.120
no good reason to ever want to do this, but

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.120
it's consistent with the syntax where we can leave

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.260
one side of the colon empty and that means

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
selecting from either the beginning or the end.
