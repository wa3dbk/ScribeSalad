00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.690
Alright. So I'd like to talk just really briefly about building a test

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.840
suite for a piece of software. So test suite is just a collection

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.320
of tests. And it's often the case that the test suite can be

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.580
run automatically. It's also often the case

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.380
that test suite gets run periodically. So

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.980
for example, perhaps nightly, on every

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.630
commit. Although in many cases that's infeasible,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.620
since, if commits are frequent and the test case is slow. The goal of

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.430
a test suite is to show that some software under test has some

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.500
desired properties, namely passing all of the

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.110
tests. Although it's very common for real

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.810
software to almost always be in a state of partial failure. But what

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.490
we hope is that most of the time, most of these failures are

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.180
not particularly severe ones. So the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.990
question is, if you're maintaining a software

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.710
project, what goes into the test suite? And to a large extent, this is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.070
a matter of taste and preference, but on the other hand there's some

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.800
pretty common features of nearly all test

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.430
suites. It's very common, first of all,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.320
to have a lot of unit tests or at least feature-specific tests that

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.570
are small tests that exercise very specialized

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.850
behaviors. So, for example, if we're developing

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.000
some sort of a web browser, we might have tested effect that different

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.190
HTML elements render correctly and that sort of thing. It's also very common

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.830
for a test suite to contain large realistic inputs. So, for example, if

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.910
we're testing some sort of a microprocessor, maybe we'd boot up Linux and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.700
run it for a couple of hours, and the purpose of these kind

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.100
of inputs is to provide realistic stresses on the system. And to exercise

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.381
a lot of features and combination. And make sure that things are up

00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:15.866
to scuff. It's nearly, always a good idea to include regression tests in

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.837
a test suite. Now, regression tests is

00:01:17.837 --> 00:01:19.982
basically any input that's cause any version

00:01:19.982 --> 00:01:23.070
in the software in the test, to fail at any time. And, there are several

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.130
reasons regression tests exist. The main one of which, is we want to make sure

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.640
that the software in your test doesn't regress. That is to say that it doesn't

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.360
go back into a state in which it fails on a bug that we

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.810
already fixed. There are a number of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.050
reasons why that could happen. First of all,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.770
regression tests are useful because whatever the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.350
defect was in the software that caused the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.030
bug in the first place, we might not have gotten rid of all the instances

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.790
of that defect in a source code. So, for example, a buggy piece of

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.800
code might have been cut and pasted to several other places, and those other

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.930
locations might not be causing our system

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.970
to fail currently, but some other change

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.200
might enable the buggy code to fire, and make the bug happen again. Another

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.880
reason is it is pretty easy through, for example, mess ups with the revision

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.140
control system. To accidently go back to an old version of a file, before

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.450
we fix the bug; if that happens we want to catch it as soon

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.360
as possible, because, because some regression test

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.600
trips. Third reasons is that defect in software

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.419
come from errors in people's thinking, it's

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.650
pretty often the case, that the person

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.460
who introduce the defect into the software;

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.080
didn't actually correct the error that they

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.300
had in their thinking. Rather maybe somebody else fix the defect. And the person

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.450
retains their mistaken assumption about some sort

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.280
of an API or something. And due

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.300
to this latent error in somebody's head, they can go ahead and start adding

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.700
similar defects to the system later on. And if we have good regression tests,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.030
we stand more of a chance of catching those kind of things. And something

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.780
that usually doesn't go into a test suite is a random tester. And for whatever

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.790
reason I'm not totally sure that I

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.510
understand all the reasons even. Random testing

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.270
is often treated as a separate activity. This is related to the fact that random

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.120
tests often are non deterministic unless we're

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.860
being careful to preserve the same seed. They

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.710
don't have a clear correctness criterion. And

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.710
perhaps more importantly, random tests always have a

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.370
possibility of showing us something new. That

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.660
is to say, they have the possibility of

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.900
introducing a test case that we haven't

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.400
seen before. In fact, that's what we hope

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.770
will happen. And the reason that might

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.540
be undesirable, is the test suite is supposed

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.770
to be predictable. It's supposed to consist of things that we know to test for.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.120
Now, if all of a sudden, the test

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.620
starts containing new and different tests, then that's

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.970
not necessarily good. So, for whatever combination of

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.270
these reasons, random testing is often a separate activity.
