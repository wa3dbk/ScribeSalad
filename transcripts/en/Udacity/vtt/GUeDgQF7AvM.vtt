00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.590
You've seen some
different CSS properties.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.260
And perhaps, you've even noticed
some commonalities between them.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.400
For example,
properties like width, height and

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.100
padding all expect values
that express length.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.070
And much like measurements in real life,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.410
these properties use
units to describe length.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.810
In real life, we use units like meters,
miles, feet, and

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.050
centimeters to describe length.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.480
But in CSS, we use units like pixels and
percentages.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.100
CSS units, like pixels and percentages,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.959
can be categorized into two distinct
groups, absolute and relative units.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.500
Absolute units refer to
fixed units of measurement.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.250
Relative units refer to units that are a
comparison to another linked property.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.500
Consider this example of a road.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.200
If i'm describing how wide
it is an absolute units,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.520
I would say something like
the road is 7.2 meters wide.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.670
But if I'm describing how
wide it is in relative units,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.330
I might say something like
the road is two car lengths wide.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.720
A car length is relative to
the average length of a car, and

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.120
can change over time.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.310
So how does this look in CSS?

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.750
If we look at this example,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.490
we have a property width being
passed the value of 400 pixels.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.410
400 is our number value, and
pixels is our unit of measurement.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.720
Pixels are an absolute form of
measurement that corresponds to one

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.280
physical device pixel on your display.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.940
Any modern screen be it a screen
on a mobile device, tablet,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.790
laptop, desktop monitor, or television
is made up of millions of pixels.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.650
We can use these pixels to define
exact links that we want to

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.130
pass to properties.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.730
But pixels aren't the only unit
of measurement used in CSS.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.740
There are actually a lot more.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.570
For absolute units pixels
are the most common.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.200
However there are others like
millimeters, inches and centimeters, but

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.370
these are rarely if ever used.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.362
For relative units we already
know about percentages but

00:01:56.362 --> 00:02:00.660
there are others like ems,
viewport width and viewport height.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.120
Percentages are the most
common relative unit.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.430
But you won't be using them for
a few lessons.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.400
You'll use relative units more, when you
start learning about responsive design.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.160
We'll stick with pixels for now.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.100
