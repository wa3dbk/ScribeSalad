00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.200
I'd like to take a moment and

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.600
show you the process of
creating an object diagram.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.280
You might also hear this process
referred to as object decomposition.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.230
That is, we're taking something
that's a big object, like an app,

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.750
and we're breaking it down into
its individual components.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.660
Now there's no right or
wrong way to do this.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.120
If 100 people create
an object diagram for an app,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.570
there might be 100 completely
different diagrams.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.260
Also, there are some informal and
formal ways to create them.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.250
A formal way might be creating
an object diagram using

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.780
the Universal Modeling Language,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.940
or UML, and an example object
diagram's given here on the left.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.660
Now UML as a modeling language contains
a bunch of standard symbols and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.460
icons that are helpful for
laying out the components of a project.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.244
But for many, UML can be
really bulky to work with, and

00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:48.800
I fall into that category.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.070
I'm more of a fan of an informal
approach that takes some ideas from UML,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.350
but it doesn't get bogged down
in the nitty gritty details.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.930
And an example of a more informal object
diagram is given here on the right.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.650
So for this example I'm going to take
an app that you'll see later called

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.410
Alien Adventure.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.750
This is the main screen for the app, and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.970
I can interact with it by
tapping on the screen.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.410
And we can see that this robot will
animate across the screen, and

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.510
there's an alien,
there's actually multiple aliens.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.630
And the robot and
the alien will have a discussion,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.900
and they'll go back and forth.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.580
And if the robot answers the alien's
question correctly, then these little

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.340
badges will appear in the lower
left hand corner of the screen.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.800
I'm going to stop right here.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.280
At this point we've already seen
enough of this app to actually start

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.270
the object decomposition process.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.835
So I'm going to open a Google
drawing to build the diagram.

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:42.100
But you could use a piece of paper,
a napkin,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.780
a tool like draw IO, which I have that
opened up in this other tab here.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.860
This is a Draw.IO diagram,
or really just

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.200
any tool that gives you the ability
to put your ideas into a diagram.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.700
Personally I'm a big fan of napkins and
I can say from personal experience that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.223
a lot of great ideas I've
diagrammed on napkins, and

00:02:01.223 --> 00:02:03.780
I'm willing to say that there's
probably some other amazing apps out

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.400
there that have been diagrammed on
napkins but that's a different story.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.060
The first thing we'll start with
is the first big object which is

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.250
the app itself.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.466
Now the app isn't an actual
object in code, but

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:18.278
that's okay, we're going to
use it as are starting point.

00:02:18.278 --> 00:02:22.080
And if we think about what we saw when
we were playing around with the app,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.960
we can start adding those
objects to the diagram.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.910
So we know that there's a robot and
that there were aliens, so

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.070
I'm going to go ahead and
make some rectangles to represent those.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.060
And we'll add labels for
the robot object and the alien object.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.820
You'll notice that I'm using the
singular form of alien and not aliens,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.680
even though there were
multiple aliens in the app

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.830
if we were to continue playing it.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.490
And this is a personal preference,
and it's one of those aspects of UML

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.300
that I'm blending with
this informal approach.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.090
In UML you typically refer to
objects in their singular form.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.400
Also, if I was using
a more formal process,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.900
I might use a certain type of symbol for
an object maybe a rectangle.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.720
And then a certain type of symbol for
a struct like a rounded rectangle.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.110
But again, because we're
keeping it pretty informal,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.090
I'm just going to use rectangles for
everything.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.810
Now what else did we notice in the app.?

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.770
What else seemed to stand out in our
mind as a self contained entity?

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.140
What else could be considered
part of the application?

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.870
Some of the things that I can
think of are the background.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.170
We also had badges that appeared
in the lower left hand corner.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.620
And there was a dialog
bubble at the top, and

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.360
it consisted of multiple lines of text.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.620
This is a pretty good set
of objects to start with.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.140
These were all things that we
could clearly see with our eyes.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.890
But there could also be objects
that are behind the scenes.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.640
Things that we can't see, but still make
up some part of the application itself.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.860
For example,
what about the concept of a game world?

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.630
Maybe the aliens and the robot and

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.630
everything within it can be
thought as parts of a game world.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.845
So I am going to go ahead and add a
symbol for world to our object diagram.

00:03:55.845 --> 00:04:00.450
And adding world here is just another
example of what I want to stress to you,

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.240
this process is not exact science.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.920
It's a very creative,
abstract thinking type of process.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.730
No two people will probably
create the same object diagram.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.215
Now I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:11.215 --> 00:04:14.585
stop here, in just a moment we're
going to refine this diagram.

00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:17.075
We're going to think about how
the objects are interconnected,

00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:20.295
and we're also going to look to see
if the objects have similarities,

00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:22.955
because that's a big
deal when designing apps.

00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:27.205
If some of the objects share traits and
other similar functionality,

00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:29.785
then we can take advantage of that
later when we start writing code.
