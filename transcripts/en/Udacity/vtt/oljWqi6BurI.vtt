00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.750
Now we've been working a lot with rectangles and you may wonder whether there

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.210
are shapes you can use, and indeed you can. I'm going to show you know more

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.950
about the graphics library that you get with this course. It's a simple

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.370
library, I've created it especially for this course. It's very similar to the

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.240
standard Java library but it's a bit easier to use. You can find the full

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.560
documentation on the web. But let's just walk through the basics so you get a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.100
feel for what you can do. Here is an example of a silly drawing that you can

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.298
create. When you look at the drawing, you can see rectangles, lines, circles,

00:00:37.298 --> 00:00:42.230
and text. You already know about rectangles, so let's move on to the other

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.764
elements. Let's say you want to draw a line from this point to this one. You

00:00:46.764 --> 00:00:51.520
need the coordinates of the start and the end. And then you simply construct

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.840
the line by giving the coordinates to the line constructor. You store the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.730
object in a variable. And when you're ready to draw it you call the draw

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.290
method, just like you would for rectangles. Now let's say if you want to draw a

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.060
circle or an ellipse. A circle is just an ellipse that's symmetrical. Find the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.700
rectangle that fits around the ellipse. Determine its top left corner, its

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.510
width, and its height. And then construct the ellipse, really in the same way,

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.760
as you would have constructed, the surrounding rectangle. Finally if you want

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.760
to show some text, specify the top left corner point, and construct a text

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.590
object. Simply give the coordinates and the message that you want to display.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.640
That, in a nutshell, is our graphics library. Sara has prepared a couple of

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.320
simple practice problems for you.
