00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.850
To set a Matrix4 in creation, you can pass the values for the matrix in the

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.804
constructor function. These values happen to set the matrix to perform

00:00:07.804 --> 00:00:12.316
translation, moving an object to the position 12, 16, negative 5. Note that this

00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:16.389
initialization is purposely made to look like column major form. Where the

00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:20.660
translation values are on the right. However, this order is not how the data is

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.860
stored in the matrix itself. Looking at the order here, 1, 0, 0, 12. You might

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.540
expect to see that in the matrix itself. But instead you see 1, 0, 0, 0. That's

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.490
because as we've pointed out before the translation values go at the very end of

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.327
the matrix as show here. Since translation is a common transform 3JS provides a

00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:46.720
function to set a translation matrix called makeTranslation. You give the

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.230
position and it fills in the matrix for you. So say we have our robot arm, in

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.444
object 3D. To apply a matrix 4D to an object 3D, the most direct way of doing so

00:00:56.444 --> 00:01:01.466
is to set the local matrix on the object itself, however you also need to set

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:06.576
matrix auto update to false. Remember that 3JS has its own transform system

00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:12.112
built in. Position, Rotation and Scale. By setting matrix auto update to false

00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:16.630
you say, don't use this, but use this matrix instead.
