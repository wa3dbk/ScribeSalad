00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.150
Couple of issues arise with respect to visitor pattern.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.150
First off, if you think about it, the actual operation called at any

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.140
time is dependent on two things. An element such as assignment statement and

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.090
a particular visitor such as type checking. This dependency is sometimes called

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.243
double dispatch. It most of object oriented languages you're familiar with,

00:00:21.243 --> 00:00:26.490
there's single dispatch. That is, you send a message to a particular object.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.730
That, whatever method responds to that message, depends on what object

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.660
you're sending it to. In languages like Ada, the determination of who's going to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.430
handle a particular message is determined not just by one argument, but by all

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.240
the arguments. Here we're looking at a situation where we're going to make that

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.350
determination on what operation we're going to apply based upon two arguments.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.000
Second issue is, who is responsible for performing the actual traversal,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.020
if we're talking about a compiler what we want to do is a tree walk and there

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.420
are variant, various variants of tree walks. We can place the code to perform

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.130
that tree walk in several places. We can place it in the ObjectStructure class,

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.020
in the Visitor class, or we can have some kind of Iterator object.
