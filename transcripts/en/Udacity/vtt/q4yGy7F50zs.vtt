00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.050
The answer is the first two can be produced.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.720
The third one cannot. And the way to see that

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.470
is to follow the rules. So if you start

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.790
from sentence, well, we only have one rule from sentence,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.710
so we're always going to end up with subject verb

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.270
object. We also only have one rule from subject and

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.830
one room, rule from object. So we're always going to end

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.590
up with noun verb, followed by object, which also is

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.300
replaced with noun. From here, we have lots of

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.460
choices, so we can replace the noun with Python.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.050
We can replace the verb with eat, and we

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.290
can replace the second noun with cookies. That will

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.630
derive the first sentence. We could replace the second

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.470
noun with Python, using instead the second choice, that

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.300
would derive the second sentence. There is no way

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.810
to produce the third one. We can get close.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.550
We can turn the noun into I, following this rule.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.790
We can turn the verb into like, following this rule.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.850
We can't turn the noun into eat. The noun can

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.950
either by I, Python or cookies. So that's why we

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.990
can't derive the third sentence. The important thing about replacement

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.970
grammars is we can describe a large language. In fact,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.030
an infinitely large language with a small set of rules.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.820
This language itself is quite small. But we'll see how to

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.810
describe much bigger languages, still using a small number

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.070
of rules soon. And it is very precise; we

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.060
can figure out exactly what sentences are in the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.600
language, just by following the rules here, doing replacements.
