[Norvig] Now, before we go on to constraint number 3,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I want to go backwards a little bit and say there's 2 concepts we haven't talked about yet:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the concepts of being next to and immediately to the right of.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Immediately to the right of--well, because we've used house numbers

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to assign houses, we can say that house 1 is immediately to the right of house 2

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
if they differ by 1, if h1 - h2 is 1.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So house number 3 is immediately to the right of house number 2.

00:00:27.000 --> 09:59:59.000
What I want you to do is fill in the code for next to to say if 2 houses are next to each other.
