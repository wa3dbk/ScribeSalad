00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.420
The answer is about the same as what we started with, except that it's missing

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.413
the space at the beginning and at the end. And if I actually run the method in

00:00:07.413 --> 00:00:13.940
blueJ, you can see it right here. Let's look at the documentation. Again, I'm

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.500
in the string documentation and I'm going to look for the Trim method. It says

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.430
it returns a copy of the string with leading and trailing white space omitted.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.190
This part here is just explaining what we mean by white space, exactly. The

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.560
white space is usually things that you can't see easily, like a tab or a space.
