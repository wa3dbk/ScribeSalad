00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] So, now we're ready for a quiz about aliasing.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The question is what is the value of agent index 2 after the following code runs?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And we have 3 assignment statements.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The first assignment statement creates the list 0, 0, 7,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and assigns that to the variable named spy.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The second assignment assigns spy to the variable named agent,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and then the third assignment assigns agent index 2 +1

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to the position at spy index 2.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So what's the value of agent 2 after all of this code?
