00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
So we just discussed the number of distribution channels available to a startup

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:13.010
and we talked about picking one but what's really interesting is the solution complexity

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.660
that each channel can handle.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.550
That is system integrators are designed to handle complex systems.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.500
And so therefore on the x-axis, we see increasing complexity of what each channel can actually have.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.240
And what's the sales and marketing complexity of each sale on the y-axis?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.550
So for example, system integrators are great for putting in defense systems

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.950
or telecom systems that require hundreds or thousands

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.120
of moving parts and software and hardware.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.960
Where on the other extreme, the complexity of selling toner over the web. Incredibly simple.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.180
Simply, consumers already know what they want

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.190
and the channel just simply is there to fulfill end-user demand.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.270
And the marketing complexity, would simply just say toner for you printer.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.160
So when we look at a sales channel, we talk about what's called value-added.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.380
How much value is the channel adding?

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.420
And as we go up this curve, we're seeing higher value added at each step.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.710
Web: Telesales, almost no value added. Retail maybe adds a little support.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.540
VARs, a lot of integration and support. Direct sales, that's direct connection to your factory.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.870
System integrators, not only supporting, servicing, and integrating your products

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.670
but potentially tens of others.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.210
So each portion of this channel is adding higher and higher value.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.810
Now what's interesting is this higher value added comes with a cost.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.030
Typically, higher volume systems are at the low end.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.430
So you might be selling hundreds or hundreds of thousands of cases of toners,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.610
but you might be doing ten large system integrations a year.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.030
So more examples, retail channel might carry PCs.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.910
VARs might do video editing systems that are turnkey.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.420
For direct sales though, this is the anomaly.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.660
Remember, these are the salespeople who work for you directly.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.770
One of the interesting things that you'll be considering later is

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.380
how much you're paying your salespeople and how many dollars they need to be bringing in

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.700
every year to justify their existence and bringing a profit to their company.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.310
So this ends up to be an interesting calculation.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.200
Your direct sales people can actually be the one talking to the consumers directly

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.920
or they could be the ones selling to system integrators,

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.920
VARs, retail, and web and telesales people and so this is a math problem we'll think about

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.300
in the coming discussions.
