00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is M XOR M'.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The reason for this is because each cipher text

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is the result of XORing a message with a key.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
C is equal to M XOR K.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
C' is equal to M' XOR K. Note that the K is the same in both cases.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If we XOR C and C', that's going to be M XOR K XOR M' XOR K.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The really useful thing that happens if you're trying to break this cipher

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is these two Ks will cancel out.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That's why you end up with M XOR M'.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That doesn't tell right away what the message is.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If the messages were exactly the same M XOR M' would just be zero,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and this wouldn't tell us anything.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The ciphertext XORed will be zero, but they weren't exactly the same.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
When the Allies XORed these ciphertexts they didn't get all zeros.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The reason for that was because of the abbreviations that were used in the transmission.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
An example would be if the original message has Spruchnummber,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
meaning serial number, maybe in the retransmission it became an abbreviation Spruchnr.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
That would mean the place were the letters start to be different we start

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to see differences between the ciphertext and the ciphertext prime.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Unlike the key which was pretty close to random,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
there were a lot of things you could guess about the messages.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The Allies had a pretty good guess that the message was in German.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The Allies could start trying. Let's say they guess the message.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We'll guess it's M&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Then we could try seeing what we get when we do M XORed with a C XORed with a C'.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We can make some guess for the message.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Try XORing it the intercepted ciphertext.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That should give us back the other message,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and we'll look if that looks like a possible message.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This is definitely a painstaking process but something that can be done.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Once you get the two messages by this guessing process,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
then it's easy to find the key.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Once you have the two messages through this guessing,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
you had the ciphertext intercepted. Now you know the key.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Learning the messages might be useful.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
By the time you've done all this work maybe it's too late for the message to be useful,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but learning the key could be really useful.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This was done by Col. John Tiltman who took these two intercepts

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and determined the key that produced them.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
They had enough content here that there were 4000 letters in the intercept,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
so they had a 4000-long key.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
This key was given to Bill Tutte. This was his first assignment at Bletchley Park.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
He was to try to make sense of these key.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
After about 6 months of work, he was able to determine

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the machine structure that produced that key,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and this is what it is.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You have five lines going in.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
This is the five bits in the Baudot code for encoding each character.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The rest of the machine is to produce the key bits.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
There is an XOR with each of these wheels.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
These wheels will rotate with each character.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Then there is another set of wheels that sometimes rotate and sometimes don't.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We have these two M wheels.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Based on the result of XORing the M wheels, either all the S wheels rotate one position

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
for that character or none of them do.

00:03:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This was really the biggest weakness in Lorenz cipher--the S wheels all moved at once.
