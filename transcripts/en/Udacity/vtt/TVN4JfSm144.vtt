00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.117
What is the P value? We can't use the T table. We can use the T table for an

00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:03.206
interval estimate for our P value but we can't use it to find the exact P

00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:15.544
value. Since our sample has 8 values, we have 7 degrees of freedom. And out T

00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:22.629
statistic is in between 0.896 and 1.119. That means the upper tail of our P

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:29.778
value would be between 0.15 and 0.20. And so, at the lower tail of our p value

00:00:29.778 --> 00:00:35.756
which means that our total p value would be between 0.3 0.15 plus 0.15, and

00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:43.960
0.4. 0.2 plus 0.2. But we don't need to be able to do it by hand or with a

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.396
table. Because these days, we can use software. There's a website called graph

00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:53.230
pad. The link is below. And use that to calculate what this p value is, and you

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.101
should find that it's between 0.3 and 0.4. Navigate to statistical

00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:02.188
distributions and interpreting p-values, and then based on the fact that we're

00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:08.670
doing a two-tailed test, and we know our t-test statistic, figure out the rest.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.818
What did you get for the two-tailed p value? Is this statistically significant,

00:01:12.818 --> 00:01:17.844
or not statistically significant? And that's because of which of these options.

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:20.453
Therefore, what's our decision?
