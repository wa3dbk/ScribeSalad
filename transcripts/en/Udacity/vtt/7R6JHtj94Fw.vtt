00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.870
In this question, you're going to go to the Play Store

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.270
and find an app you don't like, and then we're going to deconstruct

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.340
why. Now, you may already have an app in mind, something you've

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.520
used and don't like. You can use that. If you do go

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.220
to the Play Store, you may have to look a bit.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.280
Sometimes Play Store will tend to feature the higher rated apps, of

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.110
course, so you may have to dig a little deep. After you

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.550
find an app you don't like so much, you should make two

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.250
flows, in Prezi. In the first flow you will describe, or depict I should say,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.390
one flow through the app as it currently exists. I say one flow, because complex

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.990
apps can have a complicated hierarchy of

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.400
potential flows. After you do this, you're going to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.110
think at a high level. Now, what about

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.504
this flow is making you unhappy? And then,

00:00:49.504 --> 00:00:54.280
you're going to fix it. Now, not every app that displeases you

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.410
is wrong because of its high level flow. You may just

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.370
not be the intended audience. But hopefully you can find one

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.770
where this is the case, and focus on it. Once you've

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.720
made your two flows, you're going to post to the forum. You

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.420
can either find the thread in the instruction that's below, or

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.050
in the discussion section off to the side. The goal of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.220
this whole question is to get your thinking and speaking like

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.480
a designer, and making high level improvements to products.
