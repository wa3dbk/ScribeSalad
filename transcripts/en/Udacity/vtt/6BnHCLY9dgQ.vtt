00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.078
The answer is, no, we can't. I can't think of two numbers that add to equal

00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:08.546
184,000 and multiply to equal product of negative 200 and negative 133,200. Or

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:13.196
even if those numbers do exist, they're going to be really, really hard for me

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:17.695
to think of. So what are we going to do now? We can't just read these off the

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:21.615
graph either. It's really hard to tell exactly where they are.
