Should be obvious, that this first one, is the least likely to create an

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:08.546
emotional response. Why? Because it's the only one that doesn't touch on

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:13.277
something important to a person. We only experience emotion, when our personal

00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:18.366
goals and values are involved. Moods do sometime effect emotion, making certain

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:22.765
emotions more likely than others. For instance, when you're in a good mood, you

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.230
experience happiness or giddiness more easily, and anger and sadness less

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.840
easily.
