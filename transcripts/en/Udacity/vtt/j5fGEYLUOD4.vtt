00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.036
&gt;&gt; Here are three options for measuring the variability using all data values.

00:00:05.036 --> 00:00:10.120
One option is to find the average distance between any two data values. So, for

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.240
example, if you had a bunch of data values, you find the distance between each

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.666
one from each other, and then you take the average. Or find the average distance

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:25.691
between each data value and either the min or the max. So the distance between

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:30.261
these two, these two, these two, et cetera. Or you could use the min. So the

00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:35.172
distance between those two and all of them, and then find the average. Or find

00:00:35.172 --> 00:00:40.296
the average distance between each data value and the mean. So if this is the

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:46.038
mean, find the average distance between each one of them and that point. Which

00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:48.580
of these do you think would be best?
