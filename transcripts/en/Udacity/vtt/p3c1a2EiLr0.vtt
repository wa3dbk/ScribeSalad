00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.358
Caesar is a very intense manager. He forces his employees to meet the demands

00:00:04.358 --> 00:00:09.747
that are nearly impossible. For example, he forced Jonathan to work on the day

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:14.872
after he had a major surgery on his leg. Anyone who knows Caesar knows he's

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:19.932
incredibly confident. Too confident, in fact. Even though he is so confident if

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:24.568
he receives the smallest criticism he is extremely sensitive to it. What kind

00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:26.770
of personality disorder does Ceaser have?
