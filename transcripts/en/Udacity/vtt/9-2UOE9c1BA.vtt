00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.790
So, we can think about some general principles that one, has to keep in

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.710
mind as an OS designer in designing

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.708
operating systems for earlier machines. The first principle

00:00:12.708 --> 00:00:15.590
is of course cashe conscious decisions. What

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.480
that means is, you want to pay attention

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.510
to locality. Exploit affinity to caches in

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.100
scheduling decisions for instance. And you want to reduce

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.640
the amount of sharing of data structures. If you reduce

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.270
the amount of sharing of data structures, you're reducing contention. So,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.220
limit the amount of sharing to system data structures. We've

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.830
seen this when we talked about different synchronization algorithms. We talked

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.810
about how we can reduce the amount of sharing of

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.320
the system data structure, so that we can limit the amount

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.600
of contention, that's important to do, and the other thing that

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.470
you want to do is, you want to keep the memory

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.360
accesses local to every node in the multiprocessor as

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.230
possible, and basically what that means is you're reducing

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.129
the distance between the accessing processor and the memory.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.580
Already, the distance is pretty big when you go

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.180
outside the chip, and access the memory over here.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.830
But, the distance is even more if you have

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.210
a traverse interconnection network. And reach into a memory

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.560
that is on a different node of the multiprocessor.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.940
So, keeping memory access local is another important principle that

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.570
you want to adhere to in designing operating system for, multiprocessors.
