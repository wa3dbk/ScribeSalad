00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.410
The lack of deaths in the brewery is perhaps a less salient part of

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.720
John Snow's map, but it's certainly an interesting one.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.050
As it turns out, the brewery gave an unlimited beer allowance to its workers,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.310
and since the fermentation process killed the cholera bacteria,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.230
none of the workers contracted the disease.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.350
You can read more about the outbreak and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.030
John Snow's discovery in the instructor notes.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.730
His work in visualization with a start of modern epidemiology.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.450
John Snow demonstrated how data visualization can be

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.870
used to trace the spread of disease.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.220
In this case, a single pump carrying contaminated water throughout a community.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.320
Here's a different interactive visualization that comes from The Guardian,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.940
which encodes missing values in a slightly different way.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.990
This visualization dis, displays the extent to which gay rights are protected by

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.600
law in each of the states as of May 2012.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.150
States that have no laws or

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.710
that are unclear about the laws have this light grey coloring.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.630
And states that prohibit or ban gay rights have the striped pattern.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.530
For example, many states in the northeast have employment laws which

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.970
prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.200
While most states in the southeast and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.350
many in the midwest lack such employment laws.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.830
This is an interesting visualization because it makes use of texture or

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.510
pattern to represent different aspects about the states.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.490
For example, this outer red ring displays many states that prohibit or

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.880
ban same sex marriage.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.790
And this darker blue inner ring shows a few states that do

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.660
not permit adoption by a single person or joint adoption by same sex couples.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.530
Between this visualization and John Snow's map we can see that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.870
there are many ways to encode values of zero, missing values, or

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.160
perhaps other categorical values of data like in this visualization.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.700
So now I'd like to turn it over to you.
