00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.270
Let's look at the solution for the part two of our one cycle quiz.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.010
Where we are looking at reservation stations and trying to figure out

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.550
what's happening to them. To figure out what happens to reservation stations,

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.900
we need to figure out whether there is something that issues. So

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.250
does this instruction issue? What happens to the instruction that is

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.420
broadcasting its result and is there any result capturing in

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.780
the remaining reservation stations? We can do this in any order but

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.440
we have to be careful if multiple updates are made into the same field. So

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.710
let's try to do it just, you know, let's firs see what issuing is going to do.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.670
Well, when we are issuing we are going to look for a free reservation station.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.400
There is one. So, this reservation station becomes occupied.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.160
This is an add instruction so we put add here. And it adds F0 and F1.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.490
We consult the Rat here to check what are we going to do.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.851
Both of these are pointing at reservation stations. So

00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:07.865
our first operand is whatever RS0 produces. And

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:14.320
our second operand is whatever RS1 produces. But that's not the end.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.260
We also need to consider what happens when a result is broadcast.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.360
What happens then, is that this instruction frees its reservation station,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.140
so this one is not going to be occupied anymore at the end of this cycle.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.740
I put an x here, but what you should have done is not select this one

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.810
as still busy. This one of course, remains busy.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.257
The result that is broadcast here is captured by anybody waiting for R 0.

00:01:44.257 --> 00:01:52.430
So this here becomes 4.4, thus this is a change that you needed to make.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.603
This one here stays the same, actually this reservation station is free.

00:01:55.603 --> 00:02:00.654
So it doesn't matter what is here, but it stays the same. And then this one,

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:06.786
that we just put in our reservation station, needs to capture the 4.4.

00:02:06.786 --> 00:02:10.919
Otherwise things are not going to go well. So this needs to happen in the same

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.790
cycle. The processor won't work well if we left it at RS0, because RS0 is never

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.290
going to broadcast anything. This instruction is still waiting for RS1, and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.810
that's fine, RS1 hasn't executed yet. So this is all that happens

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.200
to reservation stations as a result of things that happen in this cycle.
