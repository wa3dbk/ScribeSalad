00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So to make this work out, we'll just make a little contract with ourselves.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's assume that when we're interpreting JavaScript and we come across a call to write

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we'll just figure out what the argument is--that will be some string--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and we'll append it to a special "javascript--space--output" variable

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that we'll store in the global environment.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Global because you could call write from anywhere.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Everyone has to be able to see it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So here is our glorious JavaScript interpreter, or at least the parts of it that you

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
haven't already written.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We're given the abstract syntax tree, which contains a list of JavaScript elements.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The first thing we do is make a global environment.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Global environments have no parent pointers.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This would be a parent pointer, but instead it's none.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We're going to start it out with the variable "javascript--space--output",

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
mapping to the empty string.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Then for every element in the embedded JavaScript code,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we evaluate that element--you've already seen how to do that--in the global environment.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This might make changes to it over time through calls to environment update.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
At the end of the day, the string we return is, well, we have the global environment

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
right here.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We get its 1th element, which is this mapping, and we get out the current value

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
of "javascript output," which hopefully has changed.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So it's quiz time.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You've seen our assumption, and we've written out the code for the JavaScript interpreter,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
at least at the top level.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Here I've written 3 sentences.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We could rename "javascript--space--output" to anything as long as we're consistent.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
"Javascript--space--output" is a good choice because it has a space in it,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and "javascript--space--output" starts empty, mapping to the empty string

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to support 0 calls to write.

00:01:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Multiple, multiple choice--check each one of these that's true.
