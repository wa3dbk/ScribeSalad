00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.560
We can capture the basic intuition behind work on cognitive architectures by

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.390
a simple equation, architecture plus content equals behavior.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.490
Let us look at this equation from two different perspectives.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.000
First, imagine that you want to design an intelligent machine

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.430
that exhibits a particular kind of behavior. This equation says that,

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.510
in order to do that, you have to design the right architecture, and

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.680
then put the right kind of knowledge content into that architecture,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.390
to get the behavior that you want from it. That's a complicated thing.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.800
But suppose that I could fix the architecture for you. In that case,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.410
if the architecture is fixed, I simply have to change the knowledge content to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.950
get different behaviors, which is a really powerful idea. From a different

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.260
direction, suppose that we were trying to understand human behavior.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.920
Now we could say, again, that the architecture is fixed, we could say that,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.190
this behavior is arising because the knowledge content is different.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.550
We can map now, behavior to content because the architecture is fixed.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.150
That simplifies our understanding of how to design machines or how to understand

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.830
human cognition. By the way, the same thing happens in computer architecture.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.430
I'm sure you have, are familiar with computer architecture.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.860
Computer architecture has stored programs in it, that's the content, and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.520
that running of the stored program gives you different behaviors.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.992
The computer architecture doesn't change, the stored program keeps on changing,

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:36.820
to give you different kind of behaviors. Same idea with cognitive architectures.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.200
Keep the architecture constant, change the content. Now, of course,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.640
the big question will become,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.830
what is a good architecture? And that's what we'll examine later.
