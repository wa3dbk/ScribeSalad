00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.840
So now that we have seen an example of exception handling with ROB,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.450
let's do an exceptions with ROB, quiz. So

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.150
let's say that we have these instructions in program order. So this is the order

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.730
in which they are supposed to execute, according to the programmer. Let's say,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.260
that this is the current status of this instruction. The add,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.690
is committed. Meaning, it has exited the pipeline and

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.110
its results have been committed from the ROB to the register file and so on.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.070
The load, is executing. Meaning, it has left the reservation station, it

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.770
is now doing its thing and the result still hasn't been broadcast, on the bus,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.830
and the load has not committed yet. This add, is done, which means that,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.780
it got to the reservation station, it exited the reservation station,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.000
computed it's result, deposited the result somewhere. But the result is still

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.600
not committed. Meaning, the add still hasn't left the processor. The divide,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.840
is also executing like the load here, meaning it has read these registers, and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.560
now, it's slowly computing its result. This add is done, meaning, it has

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.440
computed its result, but it still hasn't committed. And this add is also done.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.200
Let's say, that this divide, when the status of these instructions is like this,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.090
has an exception. So while it is executing, we discover, for

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.210
example that it has been trying to divide by 0.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.070
So, this add now has an exception, the question for you is what is the new

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.270
status of these instructions after this exception has been handled. Meaning,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.430
what is the new status at the point to which we can go to the exception handler?
