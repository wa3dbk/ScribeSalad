00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.503
With that reasoning in mind, we might expect the keyword this to be

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:05.803
inaccessible from the global scope as well.

00:00:05.803 --> 00:00:09.196
Instead however, the language has historically been set up so

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:12.120
that you can refer to this from the global scope.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.890
And doing so, gives you that default binding, which is to the global object.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.900
This is another confusing aspect of the language and luckily that behavior was

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.280
removed in the more modern specifications of the language.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.540
Finally, I'd like to cover one last way that the parameter this gets

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.120
a different sort of binding.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.510
The pattern we're about to see here is built to support mechanisms,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.913
we haven't explored yet and

00:00:32.913 --> 00:00:36.492
will look at in more detail in the lesson on pseudo-classical classes.

00:00:36.492 --> 00:00:40.460
In this situation, we're calling our function with the key word new before it.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.670
And that will have an effect on how the keyword this receives its binding.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.700
The positional parameters are, of course, unaffected by the keyword new.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.080
They get passed along in exactly the same way as they always are.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.510
But the binding for the keyword this is likely to surprise you.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.460
It's quite possible you've encountered discussions on

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.560
the internet of how the keyword new works.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.270
And if so, you might take a moment to conjecture what you think the binding for

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.780
this might be under these circumstances.
