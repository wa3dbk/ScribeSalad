00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.696
After sorting our 27 data values, how do we know that the median was the 14th

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:09.891
value besides by simply counting? Is there a way we can describe the median

00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:14.510
value in symbols? Let's start first by going over some symbolic notation that

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.620
we briefly mentioned earlier. Remember that these are the rankings, these are

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.652
not the actual data values, but we can denote the actual value in terms of its

00:00:23.652 --> 00:00:29.807
rank. So, the value in the first rank would be X sub 1, then X sub 2 for the

00:00:29.807 --> 00:00:36.620
second rank. X sub 3 for the third, and in the case of Udasiyans Facebook

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.955
friends, X sub 14 is the median. And remember that any value we can generically

00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:49.778
denote X sub i where X sub i is the ith value. Yes, we do say ith. So what

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:55.310
about for any data set with n values? The median will be different depending on

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.410
whether or not n is even or odd. Now, this is going to be a really tricky quiz.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.718
Which formulas describe the median after sorting the data? There's only one

00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:10.875
answer for n even and one answer for n odd. Now, really quick, this might look

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:15.470
daunting, but just remember that this subscript part corresponds to the rank.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.544
So, for example, say there are four values in the data set, n divided by 2

00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:27.364
means 4 divided by 2 which is 2. So this would mean X sub 2, which is the

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:33.820
second value might be the median if n is 4. I'm not saying that's right, I'm

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.452
just giving you an example. So give this your best short. And again, this

00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:40.953
should really help get you used to using symbols.
