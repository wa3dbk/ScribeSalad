00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.938
So let's analyze the complexity here.

00:00:01.938 --> 00:00:04.274
So the word complexity is possibly a function

00:00:04.274 --> 00:00:08.044
of both the number of vertices, V, and the number of edges, E.

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:12.647
So the worst case, what is the portion of the word complexity that is a function of V,

00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:14.927
and what is a portion that's a function of E?

00:00:14.927 --> 00:00:17.537
So your choices are as a function of V,

00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:23.824
constant with respect to V, log V, linear, order of V, V log V, or V-squared.

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:30.285
Similarly for E, constant order of 1, order of log E, order of E, order of E log E,

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.249
and quadratic and E, order of E-squared.
