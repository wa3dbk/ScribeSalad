00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.882
Our model is the log of price equals 0.415 plus 9.144

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:14.970
times the cube root of carat, minus 1.093 times carat plus a series

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.490
of coefficient times each factor in cut another series of coefficient times

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.723
each factor in color. And another series of coefficients times each factor

00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:29.060
in clarity plus an error term. What could

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.500
be some problems when using this model. What

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.910
else should we think about when we're using

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.180
it. Go ahead and enter your answer here.
