00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.400
CSS in this style.CSS file.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.420
You wont be learning CSS in this class, but

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.080
if you want to learn more, check out the link in the instructors notes.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.470
CSS is pretty simple.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.240
As we can see over here, it simply defining the styles of the page.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.200
&gt;&gt; So what about this .jQuery file that you wanted to tell them about?

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah. jQuery.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.600
It's a powerful and

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.580
popular JavaScript library that we'll be using in this class.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.200
At a very high level, it let's us inspect and manipulate the elements in a page.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.620
You won't be learning the ins and outs of jQuery in this class.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.950
But, you'll get an idea of what you can do

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.630
with some very basic jQuery functions.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.100
For more information about JQuery, check out the link in the instructor's notes.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.060
&gt;&gt; The things we're doing with JQuery are fairly simple and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.450
can be done Vanilla JavaScript as well,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.570
just like we're doing in the script tag at the bottom of the HTML page.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.770
But we wanted you to gain experience with using third-party libraries.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.360
When appropriate, we will also list the Vanilla JavaScript ways to

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.150
do things in the instructor's notes.
