00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.298
This first choice is correct. A function has an inverse if no horizontal line

00:00:04.298 --> 00:00:09.188
passes through its graph at more than one point. Now if a function passes this

00:00:09.188 --> 00:00:13.218
test, if it meets this criterion, which we call the horizontal line test, then

00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:17.062
that means that its reflection in the line y equals x will pass the vertical

00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:22.732
line test. Which means that, that reflection is a function. If we verify that

00:00:22.732 --> 00:00:26.701
the reflection of a function in the line y equals x is itself a function, then

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:32.359
that means that the original function does in fact, have an inverse.
