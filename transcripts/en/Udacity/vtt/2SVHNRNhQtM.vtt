00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.930
To construct a jellyfish topology, one can simply take

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.550
the following steps. First, pick a random switch pair

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.280
with free ports for which the switch pair are

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.160
not already neighbors. Next, join them with a link,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.100
and repeat this process until no further links can

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.360
be added. If a switch remains with greater than

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.890
or equal to two free ports, which might happen

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.330
during the incremental expansion by adding a new switch,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.320
these switches can be incorporated in the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.549
topology by removing a uniform random existing

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.680
link and adding links to that switch.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.120
For a particular equipment cost, using identical

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.520
equipment, the jelly fish topology can achieve

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.840
increased capacity by supporting twenty five percent

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.950
more servers. This higher capacity is achieved

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.690
because the paths through the topology are

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.520
shorter than they would be in a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.540
Fat tree topology. Consider a topology with sixteen

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.880
servers, twenty switches, and a fixed degree of

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.530
four for both the fat tree topology and

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.720
the jellyfish random graph. In the fat

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.100
tree topology, only four of 16 servers are

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.680
reachable in less than five hops. In contrast,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.180
in the jellyfish random graph, there are 12

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.310
servers reachable. By making more servers reachable along shorter

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.250
paths, jellyfish can increase capacity over a

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.410
conventional Fat tree topology. So while Jellyfish shows some promise, there are

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.220
certainly some open questions. First, how close

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.560
are these random graphs to optimal, in

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.230
terms of the optimal throughput that could

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.450
be achieved for a particular set of equipment.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.820
Second, what about typologies where switches are

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.750
heterogeneous with different numbers of ports or

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.170
link speeds. From a system design perspective,

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.370
the random topology model could create problems with

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.280
physically cabling the datacenter network, and there

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.790
are also questions about how to perform routing

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.310
or congestion control without the structure of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.980
a conventional datacenter network like a fat tree.
