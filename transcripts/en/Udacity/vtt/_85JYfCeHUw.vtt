00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In the quiz, we analyze the stability of the forward Euler method.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, we introduce some changes to turn the forward Euler method to backward Euler method.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This method is called an implicit solver. We are going to see why.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The backward Euler method works like this to go from the initial value of x

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to the value after the first step, it added the step size times the rate of change at times 0.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The backward Euler method works with the rate of change at the end of the first step, x(h).

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Actually, our estimate of the rate of change at the end of the first step.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Keep in mind that I'm writing x(h) but I'm referring to my estimates,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the numerical solution of the exact solution.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This means that the value at the end of the first step appears

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
on the left-hand side and on the right-hand side.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is why this is called an implicit method, we have to solve for x(h).

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's hidden in this equation. It's not explicit so let's solve for x(h).

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
When this term over to the left-hand side, then we have x at the end of the first step

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
plus time step times constant times x at the end of the first step equals the initial value,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we can factor out x(h) and find that x(h) equals the initial value divided by 1+hk.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This is something like 1/1+100 if you choose a really large h which would be 1/101.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If you form powers of these, they are going to decay pretty quickly

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and there is no oscillation whatsoever, so we have no problem at all with this expression.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's always going to work no matter how large the steps as is.

00:01:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is very handy when one tries to solve stiff differential equations.
