One idea you'll run across with transparent textures is that of premultiplied

00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:08.783
alpha. PMG files never used premultiplied alpha. Other formats vary. Texture

00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:12.205
data can be stored however you want in memory, either unmultiplied or

00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:17.293
premultiplied. So what's it mean? Here's the blending equation normally used

00:00:17.293 --> 00:00:20.990
for transparency. The source, that is the transparent object, is blended with

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.025
the destination, the object behind it using the source's alpha value.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:29.106
Premultiplied alpha means just that. The term alpha source times color source

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:32.921
is going to be the same every time this texture data is accessed. We can

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:35.981
premultiply the original color by the alpha, and store this new color in

00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:40.542
memory. This new equation saves a multiplication every single time this text

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:44.618
cell is accessed. Say we access this texture 60 times a second and a million

00:00:44.618 --> 00:00:49.174
text cells are accessed. That saves 60 million multiplies a second, which could

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:50.560
start to add up.
