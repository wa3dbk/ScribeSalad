00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.930
As I said before,
early versions of Android

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.130
didn't have the loader model.
The original deprecated model

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.573
caused frame rate drops
whenever many applications

00:00:09.573 --> 00:00:13.165
had to re-query their databases.
Even simple ones.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.209
Databases get far more complex
than what we have here in Sunshine.

00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:19.922
So the first answer
is a definite yes.

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:23.527
We noted how things
like AsyncTask are bound to the UI,

00:00:23.527 --> 00:00:25.717
so something as little
as an orientation change

00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:29.520
could kill the query.
So that's another definite yes.

00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:33.224
So the third option is just a non-starter.
