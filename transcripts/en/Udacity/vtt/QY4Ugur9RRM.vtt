Because the graph involved estimating, we can't find the exact coordinates of

00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:08.297
the point of intersection. So, here's another way that we can find it,

00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:12.622
substitution. For this method, we solve for one of the variables, and then we

00:00:12.622 --> 00:00:17.070
make a substitution for that variable into the other equation. Notice that for

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.289
these two equations, both of them are solved for y. I have y alone on one side

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.813
of the equation. Notice that both of these y's are the same variable. So, what

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:31.971
we can do is replace this y with what this y is equal to. We're going to take

00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:37.119
10x plus 10 and move it or substitute it in for y. This is the process of

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:42.703
substitution. Now, we have one equation with one variable and we can solve for

00:00:42.703 --> 00:00:48.498
this variable. We subtract 7x from both sides to get 3x plus 10 equals 12. Then

00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:53.532
we subtract 10 from both sides to get 3x equals 2. And finally, we divide both

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:58.286
sides by three. So 1x is equal to 2 3rds. Remember, x is the variable that

00:00:58.286 --> 00:01:03.204
represents how long we're renting the car. So, we rented it for 2 3rds of an

00:01:03.204 --> 00:01:07.874
hour. Alright. Here's a throwback to fractions. What's 2 3rds of an hour in

00:01:07.874 --> 00:01:12.444
minutes? Write your answer here. And don't worry about the unit. I've already

00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:13.195
included it.
