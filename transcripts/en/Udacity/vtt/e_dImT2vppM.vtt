00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.790
So now that our code has worked, let's figure out what's actually going on with

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.830
this program. Now, the first thing that strikes

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.080
me is this first line of code, which

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.830
is from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient. Now thus far,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.670
what we've been doing is statements like this,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.780
where we say import some filename. Like in

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.160
this case, import turtle, but here we have

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.010
this new word called from. So here's a task for you, we want you to find out

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.080
what this Python keyword from means? You can enter your responses in this box.
