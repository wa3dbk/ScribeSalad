00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.303
So counting let's us think about quantities
of objects and answer questions about

00:00:05.303 --> 00:00:11.460
them, whether it's how many students are
in a teacher's class or how many moons

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.178
orbit Saturn. Now, usually, when we count,
we start with the number one and then we

00:00:17.178 --> 00:00:24.192
get to two, and three, four, and so on so
forth. And we could keep counting like

00:00:24.192 --> 00:00:33.155
that until we get to huge numbers, like
1,000 or 1 million or 1 trillion, and even

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:38.540
then, we could still keep going. Now, this
special set of numbers has a name, they

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.420
are called the natural numbers. So the
natural numbers start with one and

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:47.658
increase by ones forever. So now we want
to make sure that you're totally solid on

00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:55.562
what falls under this category. Which of
these numbers are natural numbers, 735, 6,

00:00:55.562 --> 00:01:03.133
89.1, -1,000, 1/3, and 19? This is a
slightly different kind of than then the

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:07.658
last one. This time I want you to check
off all of the answers that you think are

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:12.114
right. So that might mean checking more
than one, in some cases, you might even

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:14.871
check off all of the answers that are
there.
