00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.530
You may often come across situations
where there's part of your build script

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.950
that you'll want to change
somewhat regularly.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.970
While you're well on your way to
becoming a Gradle build master,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.510
the other developers using your build,
may not be so familiar with Gradle.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.620
This means they're relying on
folks to modify your build script.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.860
In order just to change its behavior,
is less than ideal.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.950
This is especially true,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.890
if you expect an automated
system to be running your build.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.060
Solve this problem, Gradle allows you
to parametrize your build, by adding

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.380
properties to the project object, from
locations outside your build script.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.660
Command line arguments,
gradle.properties files, and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.450
environment variables.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.960
Let's check out the syntax.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.900
&gt;&gt; To explore Gradle properties,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.220
let's create a task that
prints a simple greeting.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.510
If we just run this as is,
somewhat unsurprisingly, we got a crash.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.210
Gradle says that it could not
find property greeting on task

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.540
print greeting.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.160
Yep, that's not defined anywhere.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.460
We'll need to pass in the value
of the greeting we want to use.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.520
The first way to do this,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.770
is using a gradle.properties file in
the same directory as your build script.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.379
If we just add the line, greeting
equals hello from properties file, and

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.230
rerun the task,
now we get the behavior we expect.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.130
Another way to pass in a property
to a Gradle build script,

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.900
is the command line.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.780
In this case it'd be the -P flag that

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.740
let's Gradle know that we're going
to be passing in a property,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.390
then the name of the property equals,
and then the value we want.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.550
Note that the greetings property
is now defined in two places,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.260
in the properties file,
and from the command line.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.370
Let's see which one wins.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.270
Looks like the command line wins.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.440
I hope this makes sense, because the
command line is the last line of defense

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.820
before the project is actually run.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.030
There is a third way we can
use gradle properties, and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.619
that's from inside
the build script itself.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.600
If we pass a closure to the ext property
of the project object, and then we

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.180
define our property, then the property
is defined when we run our task.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.317
Note that defining a property
inside the build script,

00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:56.737
shadows all other definitions,
like from a properties file.
