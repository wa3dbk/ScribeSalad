00:00:00.014 --> 00:00:02.727
So we're going to start with the mathematical definition of reduce.

00:00:02.727 --> 00:00:05.090
Reduce has 2 inputs.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.312
The 1st input is a set of elements, and we're going to assume they're in an array.

00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:13.789
The 2nd input is a reduction operator that will operate on the elements in this array.

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.595
For example, we have a list of numbers here,

00:00:16.595 --> 00:00:19.296
and we have a reduction operator of plus,

00:00:19.296 --> 00:00:22.534
and the reduction operator will sum them all up.

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:26.053
Let's be a little more precise in terms of what operators we're going to support

00:00:26.053 --> 00:00:28.274
with our parallel implementation.

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:31.110
Our operators need to have the following 2 characteristics.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.611
The 1st is that the operators are binary.

00:00:33.611 --> 00:00:37.514
The operator must operate on 2 inputs and create 1 output.

00:00:37.514 --> 00:00:39.821
Plus is a binary operator, for instance.

00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:42.154
Two, associative.

00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:45.465
Associativity means that if we have 2 or more operations in a row,

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:48.988
a op b op c, the order of operations doesn't matter

00:00:48.988 --> 00:00:51.433
as long as the order of the operands aren't changed.

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:55.432
To put it simply, a op b, take the result and op it with c,

00:00:55.432 --> 00:00:58.735
needs to give you the same answer as b op c,

00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:01.307
and then you op the result with a.

00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:05.945
You should convince yourself that plus is an associative operator but minus is not.

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:08.149
Now, it's not immediately clear why we need this property

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.191
but we're going to see why in a few minutes.
