00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I really hope you enjoyed all this, and the reason is

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I really want you to do a program basic statistics by yourself.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So, for the rest of your life, you know how to program it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When you know how to program it, you know how to do it,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and it will empower you to solve basic problems in probability.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I should tell you in my own life, I've built a lot of robots, and I've applied Bayes rule like crazy.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
My job talk at Stanford was all about Bayes' rule applied to robotics.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's a very powerful paradigm and I hope you enjoyed it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you want to dive deeper, there's always Udacity CS373,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which talks about programming and about half of the classes variations of Baye's rule.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'll spare you with the details here because it's a basic introduction class,

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but stay tuned for the next unit, I have another great surprise in store for you.
