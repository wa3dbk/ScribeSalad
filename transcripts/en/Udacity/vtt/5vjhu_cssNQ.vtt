00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.194
I would argue that the second answer is best. The difference between the first

00:00:04.194 --> 00:00:07.346
and the second is whether we print out a number or we return the number.

00:00:07.348 --> 00:00:10.623
Returning a number is much more useful. If we return the number, then we can do

00:00:10.623 --> 00:00:14.036
more computation with it. If we print it out, well, then it gets printed out and

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:17.813
it's hard to use for anything else. So, I'm going to assume that what we want to

00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:22.085
do is the second choice. The third choice doesn't really match what was stated.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:25.746
Maybe, we want the age in days, the third choice says, we'll give the age and

00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:29.856
years, months, and days. Note that this answer depends on the assumption we have

00:00:29.856 --> 00:00:33.931
about no time travel. We haven't described what that should be if the first date

00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:37.961
is after the second date and we don't need to because we're going to assume that

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:42.194
could never happen. That the first date must always be the same or before the

00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:43.009
second date.
