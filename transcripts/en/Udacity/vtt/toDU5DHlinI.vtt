00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.689
So, to quickly summarize, I discussed
a variety of issues of dynamic range,

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.840
what it is, and relate it back to also
things like how we can see some details

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.440
of dynamic range, and how we can capture
that kind of information in real scene.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.990
We basically talked about how image
acquisition pipeline is aimed at

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.900
capturing the scene radiance and we
want to use that to convert to pixels.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.125
We basically talked about
a variety of linear and

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:26.240
non-linear aspects of the image
acquisition pipeline.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.640
Again, remembering that really what we
want to do is capture the scene radiance

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.660
of a real scene, and
convert it to the pixel values.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.140
And how the whole pipeline works and
how we can represent and model this.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.430
Then we basically talked about the whole
idea of camera calibration, which was

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.270
aimed at basically, using a lot of data,
a data-driven method to be able to

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.060
map the information about what scene
radiance was and what pixel values were.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.900
This allowed us to create a profile
that can be used to then of course,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.060
do the opposite.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.291
Given a pixel value, what would be
the best scenery radiance for it.

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:02.130
Then we talked about
basically to do this mapping.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.070
Basically how do we go from pixel
values to different exposure images.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.850
And then a, a new radiance
map that captures a scene.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.564
Then we talked about how tone mapping
could be used to take the radiance map

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:17.760
to then display an image in
the displays that we have available.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.660
There is a lot of work out
there in the HDR area.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.640
I'm just listing a few
of the papers here.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.300
Other papers I will make
available also on the website.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.930
So you should be able to
look at them carefully.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.930
These are the ones I referred to
in this slide, sort of slide deck.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.620
And of course,
there are lots of softwares out there.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.920
I encourage you to look at
things like Exposure Fusion,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.210
that's an additional method.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.510
Builds on a whole lot of stuff
that we talked about and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.590
builds on explorant photography.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.780
And of course these types of HDR images
are now available on your cell phones.
