00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.132
The answer is GET /foo/logo.png?p=1

00:00:05.132 --> 00:00:11.610
HTTP/1.1. Now, the GET makes sense, that this is the method we're using. The

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.110
version is pretty simple. That's, that was specified in the question. Now the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.960
path is a little tricky. The path includes

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.250
this much here. But the fragments are not

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.860
included in the path. They're never sent to

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.890
the server. So when your browser makes a request,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.730
for this path, this is all it sends to example.com. The fragment and the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.150
hash mark stay purely on the client side, or in, also known as in the browser.
