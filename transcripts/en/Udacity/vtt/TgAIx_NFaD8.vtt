00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.490
Exploratory data analysis is an opportunity to let

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.930
the data surprise you. Think back to the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.670
goals of your investigation. What question are you

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.050
trying to answer? That question might be relatively simple

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.160
or one dimensional like the comparison of two

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.640
groups on a single outcome variable that you

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.490
care about. Even in such a case, exploratory

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.870
data analysis is an opportunity to learn about surprises

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.260
in the data. Features of the data that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.170
might lead to unexpected results. It can also be

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.460
an opportunity to learn about other interesting things

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.170
that are going on in your data. What should

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.090
you do first? While certainly you want to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.660
understand the variables that are most central to your

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.040
analysis, often, this is going to take the form

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.900
of producing summaries and visualizations of those individual variables.
