00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.485
So the image blurring example that we've been using actually illustrates

00:00:03.485 --> 00:00:06.725
another important kind of communication pattern called Stencil.

00:00:06.725 --> 00:00:10.110
Stencil codes update each element in an array

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.395
using neighboring array elements in a fixed pattern called the stencil.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:16.052
This is the stencil pattern we saw before.

00:00:16.052 --> 00:00:19.273
It's technically known as a 2D von Neumann stencil.

00:00:19.273 --> 00:00:22.242
Let me reiterate how this worked and, this time

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:24.855
use color coding a little differently to show you what's going on.

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:28.200
So here, I've color coded the threads to show you

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.851
which one is going to be working on which output element.

00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:34.382
So I'll choose the blue one to be writing into this value.

00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:37.030
Here's where the red one's going to write its output value.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.609
Here's where the green thread will write it's output value.

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:41.339
And if you look at what's going to happen,

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.751
each of these threads is going to read from several locations

00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:48.479
in memory surrounding the corresponding input value, and those locations are defined by the stencil.

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.067
So the blue thread will do a gather from these threads,

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:55.768
and then the red-colored thread will do a gather from the overlapping neighborhood.

00:00:55.768 --> 00:00:59.608
And then the green thread will do a gather from this neighborhood, and so on.

00:00:59.608 --> 00:01:03.064
Eventually there'll be some other thread whose responsible for, say,

00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:06.767
writing to this value, and that thread is going to go and access these values.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:12.512
So something you're going to notice right away is that there is a lot of data reuse going on.

00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:16.626
Many threads are accessing and computing from the same data.

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:21.818
And exploiting that data reuse is something we're going to use later on,

00:01:21.818 --> 00:01:23.805
when you're working on your homework assignment.

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:26.864
We're going to try to exploit that reuse to speed up your homework assignment.

00:01:26.864 --> 00:01:29.084
Now there are other common stencil patterns.

00:01:29.084 --> 00:01:33.033
For example, you might read from all of the neighboring elements,

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:36.536
including the diagonal elements, and that would be called a 2D Moore pattern.

00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:40.891
And there are also 3D analogs of these, so for my next trick, I'm going to attempt to draw a

00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:47.066
3D von Neumann stencil, which is sort of kind of a cross shape extending in all 3 dimensions.

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.734
Hopefully you can see that from my drawing.

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.771
So speaking of data reuse, here's a quick quiz.

00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:55.582
Can you figure out how many times a given input element in the array

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:58.505
will be read when applying each of these stencils?
