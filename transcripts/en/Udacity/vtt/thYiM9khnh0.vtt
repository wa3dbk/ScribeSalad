00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.750
A lot of the investors rejected us
initially because they perceived

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.270
the value of our company to be lower
than their threshold of investment.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.910
What we encountered was that investors
typically fall into two categories.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.070
The long-tail investors and
the unicorn, big fish investors.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.550
The unicorn,
big fish investors for startups,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.250
typically aren't worth the effort,
unless they've been already valued at

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.480
unicorn level, a billion dollar company,
essentially a billion dollar startup.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.860
The long-tail investors
are probably your better bet.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.446
They're the ones who will do the $2
to $5 million investments with

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:48.331
a three to five year spread
return on their investment, and

00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:53.470
then give you a long enough runway to
actually test out a lot of theories.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.560
In the other case,
with the unicorn investors,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.120
it's typically there after continued
growth valuation over time.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.930
And if at any point during
any future valuation cycle

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.830
your valuation drops,
your company's dead in the water,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.430
even though it may be
worth on paper billions.
