00:00:00.268 --> 00:00:03.640
The web app manifest is a simple
JSON file that gives you,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.140
the developer, the ability to control
how your app appears to users

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.730
in areas where they
would normally see apps.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.230
And, more importantly, how it behaves
when it's launched from the home screen.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.810
It's currently supported in Chrome and

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.690
Opera with Firefox
actively working on it.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.490
And it's currently under
consideration for Edge.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.635
At a minimum, the manifest must contain
the name of the app and a short_name.

00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:34.140
The short_name is used
on the home screen and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.710
in other places where
there is limited space.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.960
It also needs the start_url,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.730
the URL the app should open when
launched from the home screen.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.640
Make sure, the page you specify is
cached as part of the app shell.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.950
Otherwise, you won't get the benefits
of a cached app shell and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.480
your app won't work offline.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.700
One quick tip.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.620
To track the number of users
who are launching your

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.330
app from their home screen, you can add
a query string to the end of your URL.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.420
And use any analytics to track launches,
with that query string.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.080
But don't forget to ensure that you've
cached the URL with the query string,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.510
in your service worker.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.830
Finally, we need to
provide a set of icons for

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.928
things like the home screen icon and
the tab switcher, and splash screen.

00:01:16.928 --> 00:01:20.580
The icons parameter takes
an array of icons and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.140
must include the source,
the size of the icon, and the type.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.680
For example, image/png.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.188
I recommend providing eight icon sizes,

00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:39.336
48 by 48, 96 by 96, 128 by 128,

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:45.516
144 by 144, 192 by 192, 256 by 256,

00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:50.958
384 by 384 and finally, 512 by 512.

00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:59.050
Just make sure you have icons for
1x, 2x, 3x and 4x devices.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.400
Chrome uses the 48 device
independent pixel icons for

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.150
the home screen icon and
the tabs footer.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.230
And the 128 device pixel icons for
the splash screen.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.090
Those are the minimum requirements.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.420
But there are a few other helpful things
that you should set in the manifest.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.210
The background color, and
theme color are used by the browser

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.770
along with an icon,
as part of the splash screen.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.930
Shown the instant the web app is
launched, until its first render.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.830
Once the app is loaded, the theme
color tells the browser, what color to

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.690
tint the UI elements such as the address
bar or the notification tray.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.890
Display and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.300
orientation property give you control
over how the app is displayed.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.910
For example, you can hide
the address bar and the back and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.000
forward buttons,
by setting "display": "standalone".

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.900
Or if you're building a game
that works better in landscape,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.010
you can force landscape view by
specifying, "orientation": "landscape".

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.700
To save yourself some pain later,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.620
be sure to validate
the manifest you've created.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.960
Use the manifest validator linked in the
instructor's notes below to make sure

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.440
that you've got everything you need and
that it's formatted properly.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.420
Once you've created a manifest file,
the browser needs to know about it.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.961
To do that, add a

00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:26.330
href="manifest.json"&gt; to
the head of each page.
