So, what really is slope? Well, here's a line connecting two points, 2,3 and

00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:09.831
7,6. If I were to tell you that the slope of this line is 3 over 5, then what do

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:14.720
you think a good general definition of slope would be? Is the slope of a line

00:00:14.732 --> 00:00:19.831
how many units to the right are moved for every unit that the line goes up? Is

00:00:19.843 --> 00:00:24.300
it how many units the line moves up for every unit it moves to the right? Is it

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:28.128
the number of units moved vertically plus the number of units moved

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.509
horizontally? Or, is it lastly, the number of units moved vertically minus the

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:34.525
number of units moved horizontally?
