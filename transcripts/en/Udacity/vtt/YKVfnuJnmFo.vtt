This one was pretty tricky. For the first one, we get the HTML and send request

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.960
for style.css and timing.js. So, we can rule out the inline option. Next, we

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.930
get timing.js and execute it and css

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.000
arrives afterwards. This tells me this must be

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the async script, because if it weren't. We'd have to block and wait for CSS.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.600
&gt;&gt; Great job! Next one?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.160
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, we get the HTML.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.670
Send request for style.css. I don't see

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.200
any request for JavaScript. But then, when we

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.250
finish loading the CSS we run the script. So, this must be the inline case.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.790
&gt;&gt; Yup. Inline scripts, block, and CSS.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.190
&gt;&gt; And, in this last one, we have

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.600
request for CSS and JavaScript, and JavaScript arrives first.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.990
But then, we block and wait untill CSS

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.100
is available. So, this must be blocking script tag.
