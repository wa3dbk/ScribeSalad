00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.800
So, now let's look at cycle three. In cycle three,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.700
we will try to issue the next instruction which is this multiplication.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.995
We will look at whether we have a unit, yes we do.

00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:17.110
Is going to be a multiply instruction. F2 and F4 are LD2 and

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.170
the actual value of F4. So here, we will mark the actual value of F4,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.360
this is our second operand as 2.5, because that's what this says.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.660
And then for the first operand, we will mark that we are waiting for LD2.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.150
This is going to make it very easy to determine which things are,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.290
ready to execute, because the instruction should not really have anything here

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.430
if it's ready to execute. And this instruction is, not going to be ready yet,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.740
because it's waiting for the second load. And, then we're going to rename F0 so

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.200
that it points to, the reservation station, in this case,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.220
ML1, that contains this, instruction. In this third cycle, the first load is

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.180
still executing, now the question is, can the second load begin execution?

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.680
If we have a pipeline load store unit, then, yes, it would be.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.270
Because in the previous cycle, we have begun this instruction.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.400
It's in the second stage now. So now we can begin the first stage for

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.710
this instruction. But let's say we don't have a pipeline load story on it.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.350
That only our add unit is pipelined. In which case,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.240
this load will not be able to dispatch into the execution unit until cycle four

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.620
because basically the execution unit will be occupied in cycles two and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.227
three by, the first load. So, we will, [SOUND] kind of mark that in cycle four,

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:38.407
we will be able to, begin execution of this if, everything else is ready. And

00:01:38.407 --> 00:01:41.740
nothing is still broadcast in the result. The first load is still,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.090
executing in cycle three. So, now we go to cycle four. In cycle four,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.510
we will try to issue the next instruction, which is this subtract.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.580
It's going to use. And add R unit, so this is, just to mark it as a subtract,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.474
we are going to issue it in this cycle. F2 and F6, or LD2 and LD1, so

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:05.766
this one is actually waiting like this and we also have to,

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:12.960
mark the F8 as renamed. To 81 so this completes the issuing in this cycle.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.625
Now let's see, if we can dispatch something. Well, this is cycle four.

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:22.670
In cycles two and three the first load has been executing now it's ready to

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.550
write so basically we can begin execution of this instruction so

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.150
it's been dispatched in cycle four now we no longer need this.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.610
Are any of the other instructions ready to execute? Well, not in this cycle so

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.370
now we're going to write the result, in LD1. LD1 here,

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.570
we kind of note it here that it's going to write the result in cycle four

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.690
which is now, so now we're going to write to, the result of this instruction. So

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.070
we can mark here that we are writing that result. And, what's going to happen

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.930
now is basically is going to broke us with a type of LD1 and the value will be

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.670
loaded from memory from this address and that value is going to be put to F6.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.150
So, what we do now is we're going to broke that value and, capture that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.110
value everywhere, where we have LD1 in this table. So, each of these is going to

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.790
compare its tag to LD1 and whatever we see in LD1 we're going to get that value.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.180
So. In this case, only this particular instruction is going to latch its value.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.370
So let's say that the value is 7.1. Okay. That completes the result capture.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.720
We still have to put 7.1 in the actual register F6. So

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.040
somewhere in F6. We have 7.1 now, because this was pointing to LD1.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.270
LD1 is done now, so, now we can find that value in the register file. And

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.140
now we can free this reservation station. So, when you free a reservation

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.700
station, what you really do is, you just, turn off the valid bit for the entry,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.210
you don't really have to erase the whole entry. So I'm going to,

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.530
erase it just to prepare for the next instruction, but keep in mind that,

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.820
in real hardware there is just a single bit that just gets marked zero, and that

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.790
is considered to free the reservation station. Now in this cycle, in cycle four,

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.260
we have issued an instruction, we have tried to dispatch an instruction, and

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.240
we've found that only the load really can be dispatched. And, we have written a,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.700
our result back. Only one result can be written per cycle anyway.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.110
So, that's it for this cycle. So, let's move on to cycle five.
