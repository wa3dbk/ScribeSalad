00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.490
Now, in addition to recording
feedback on what to improve, we've

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.689
been recording feedback on what parts
of our app really resonate with users.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.060
This feedback is really vital to share
in a presentation on your prototype.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.740
It will be one of your greatest assets.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.300
Nothing shows that your concept
resonates with users quite like

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.290
hearing or seeing one of them be
excited when using your prototype.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.760
Because of this,
it can be a good idea to get video or

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.550
audio recordings of your
user testing sessions.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.650
The one rule is to always,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.410
always, always get permission
from your subjects first.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.030
We've said it before, and
its really vital that you do this.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.110
Ask before you record and
ask every user.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.940
What you need is a media release
form that covers research use and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.038
presentation use.

00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:43.450
This is a thing you should look for

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.710
online and then customize and
run by a lawyer before you use it.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.500
Over the course of a few
iterations of user testing,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.830
you should be able to find some users
who absolutely adore your design.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.320
If not, you may need to iterate more
before you're ready to demo your app.
