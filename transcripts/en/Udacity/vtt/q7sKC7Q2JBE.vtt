00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.240
So for a long time, I've advocated
this approach of Mobile First.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.590
And the reason why I've pushed for that
is 341, mobile's a huge opportunity.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.270
If you look at the scope of it,
it's much,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.590
much bigger than what we've had
before with personal computers.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.370
Two, mobile has new capabilities.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.840
For example, with a desktop or

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.660
laptop, we knew with 99% certainty
you were in the U.S. Yay.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.750
WIth mobile we can get you
down to like 50 meters,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.680
which is a huge, huge difference.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.200
And there's a lot of other capabilities
like multi-touch and all the sensors and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.689
devices that we didn't have before.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.350
But the third one, which I thought was
actually the most impactful was if you

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.190
go from a typical 1024 by 768
screen down to a 320 by 480,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.410
kind of early smartphone screen,
you've lost 80% of your screen space.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.770
Which means you need to think really,
really hard about what

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.030
can fit on that screen, because you
can't fit everything from before.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.600
So you have to do this really
hard thing called prioritization.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.470
And in order to prioritize, you have
to understand what you're doing for

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.910
people, why and how.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.379
And when you think about all
these different devices,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.560
mobile is a great forcing function for

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.250
getting you down to the core essence,
to what really matters?

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.460
How fast and easy can we make this?

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.500
Maybe the watch is another forcing
function because you should be able to,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.060
I saw people ordering pizzas
with their voice on their watch.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.970
But the less capabilities you have,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.950
the more creative you have to get
with how people can get stuff done.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.320
So it's a great way to essentially
force yourself to, well,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.560
we have this 40 screen check out form or
40 input field check out form,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.910
can we get it down to five,
what would that take?

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.440
Would that even work?

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.330
And when you do it on the desktop,
you don't have that concern.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.700
It's like oh yeah,
there's plenty of room.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.120
I'll just add field number 45 on page 3.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.810
People can type.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.120
So on a multi-device we're all right.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.740
I think it helps to have that filter
first, to get down to the core

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.565
essence and then you can bring
that core essence everywhere.

00:01:58.565 --> 00:02:02.180
because why should someone with a 20
inch monitor suffer through 40 form

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.980
fields, where someone with a 4 inch
monitor gets away with only five, right?

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.630
They should equally get
the same treatment.
