00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.220
Let us begin by asking ourselves,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.340
why do we need use formal logic to design an AI agent? The way the formal logic

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.270
in an AI agent would work is that there will be two parts to the AI agent.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.540
The first part of the agent will consist of a knowledge base.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.165
The knowledge will contain the agents knowledge all over the world.

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:22.590
That knowledge will be represented in sentences in the language of logic.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.920
The second part will consist of an inference engine. The inference engine will

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.930
apply rules of inference to the knowledge that the agent has. So remember again,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.140
two parts, the knowledge base and then rules of inference. Now there are certain

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.750
situations in which we want the AI agent to be able to show, to be able to prove

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.140
that the answers, that it derives to any problem in fact are provably correct.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.833
If we want to show this to itself, or to other users. In other situations,

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:56.270
we may want the AI agent to generate only provably correct solutions. How can we

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.140
guarantee that? Well we need two things. First, we need a complete and

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.260
correct knowledge base. And second, we need rules of inference that will give

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.330
guarantees of correctness of the answer. The inference then has two parts to it.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.400
The first part is called soundness. The property of soundness means that

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.320
rules of inference will derive only those conclusions that are,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.480
in fact, valid. The second property is completeness. The property of

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.990
completeness means that the [UNKNOWN] will derive all of the valid conclusions.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.760
These are two very important properties to have. If an AI agent can use

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.190
logical rules, logical rules of inference on its knowledge base and

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.260
provide guaranteed soundness and completeness, then it's a very useful thing for

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.340
an AI agent to have. For this reason, logic has been an important part of

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.935
AI since the inception of the field. In fact it continues to be

00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:49.760
an important part of research and modeling AI. In this course however we'll

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.380
discuss logic only to a very limited degree. There are two reasons for

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.205
this. First, our priorities in this course are a little different.

00:01:57.205 --> 00:02:01.000
Instead of talking about knowledge in the form of logical sentences, we are much

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.700
more interested in conceptual knowledge and experiential knowledge and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.470
heuristic knowledge. Second, recall that we said that a logic

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.360
based agent has two parts to it, the knowledge base and the rules of inferences.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.990
Even if the rules of inferences are, in fact, guaranteed to be sound and

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.150
complete, there is a problem about how do we construct a correct and

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.690
complete knowledge base? If the knowledge base of an AI agent is not correct and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.250
complete, then it may not gave you useful answers,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.780
even if the roots of inference are sound and complete. Thus, in this course,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.300
we'll use logic only to the degree to which it is useful for

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.130
specifying other methods. Methods that use conceptual knowledge or

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.040
experiential knowledge or heuristic knowledge.
