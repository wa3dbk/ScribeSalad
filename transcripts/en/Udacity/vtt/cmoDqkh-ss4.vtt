00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.610
Which is test-first development. The key idea is that any program

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.210
feature that doesn't have an automatic test simply does not exist. If

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.430
there is a feature, you need to write a test for the

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.630
feature before. So, what developers do is to create unit tests for

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.420
each such piece of functionality even before the functionality is implemented.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.720
And of course, when you run this test, they will fail. But

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.190
the beauty of it is that, as you write your code and

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.680
you add more and more fractionality to the feature that you're developing,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.820
these test cases are going to start to pass.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.190
And that's extremely rewarding because it gives you immediate

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.530
feedback, again feedback on the fact that you're

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.530
developing the code in the right way. As soon

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.000
as you write it, you will know. And if you write a piece of code and the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.550
test says still fail, that means that the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.140
code is not doing what it's supposed to do.
