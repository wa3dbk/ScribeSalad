00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.150
Now let's talk about what
happens in a write back cache.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.650
Write through is fairly simple.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.880
We just send writes to memory and

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.284
the cache works just as
we described it before.

00:00:09.284 --> 00:00:13.740
But for write back caches,
we can have a block that we did write

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.580
since we last brought
it from the memory.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.300
In that case, when we replace the block
we need to write it to memory, but

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.520
we can have a block that we didn't write
since we last brought it from memory.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.890
That block has only been
read since we brought it in.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.730
In that case,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.500
when we replace, there is no need
to write that block back to memory.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.190
But how do we know which
one of these we have?

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.960
One choice that we might make
is that we don't want to know.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.860
We'll just every time that
we replace the block.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.630
Unfortunately, there is a lot of
read only stuff that we will now

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.380
end up writing to memory over and
over, all that's unnecessary.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.730
So instead, we choose to add a dirty
bit to every block in the cache.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.090
The dirty bit says
whether we have written

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.300
the block since it was
placed in the cache, or not.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.620
So if the dirty bit is zero,
it means that the block is clean, or

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.510
it was not written since it
was last brought from memory.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.910
Or, we can have the dirty bit be one,
in which case we say that the block is

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.410
dirty, or it was written since
we last brought it from memory.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.710
And that means that we need to
write this block back to memory

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.530
on replacement.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.524
When this block is kicked out of the
cache it needs to be written to memory.

00:01:36.524 --> 00:01:38.940
If it's claim then we don't
have to write it to memory.
