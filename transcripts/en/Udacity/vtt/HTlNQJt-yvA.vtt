00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.027
So, you could either choose to subtract the c or divide by a first. It doesn't

00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:07.556
matter which order you do these in, as long as you obey all the proper

00:00:07.556 --> 00:00:11.615
mathematical rules. In particular, when we divide both sides by a, make sure

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:15.617
that you divide every term on each side by a, and do that division correctly.

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:20.103
The first time I did this, I actually messed up dealing with the second term in

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:24.656
the left-hand side. I didn't write a squared, I just didn't write an a at all in

00:00:24.656 --> 00:00:29.387
the denominator. So, everyone makes mistakes. It's not a big deal if you do. We

00:00:29.387 --> 00:00:34.261
just gotta keep learning from them. Anyway, the equation we end up with at the

00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:38.973
end of this step is the quantity x plus b over 2a squared minus b squared over

00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:41.360
4a squared equals negative c over a.
