00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.040
Here, the solutions are 2 plus or minus root 3, all divided by 2. Fantastic

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.570
work if you figured this one out. We begin to solve by moving this 8r term and

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.136
this negative 1 to the left-hand side of the equation. So we subtract 8r from

00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:17.332
both sides, and then, we add positive 1 to both sides as well. Now that we have

00:00:17.332 --> 00:00:20.518
our quadratic equation set equal to 0, we can use the values of a, b, and c

00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:25.578
inside of our quadratic equation. a is equal to 4, b is equal to negative 8,

00:00:25.578 --> 00:00:30.306
and c is equal to positive 1. We substitute these values using parenthesis

00:00:30.306 --> 00:00:34.950
around each one. The negative of negative 8 is positive 8, negative 8 squared

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.035
is positive 64, and these three factors give us a product of negative 16. Here,

00:00:41.035 --> 00:00:45.352
the denominator just simplifies to 8. We subtract inside our radical to get 8

00:00:45.352 --> 00:00:50.328
plus or minus the square root of 48, all divided by 8. Next, we want to

00:00:50.328 --> 00:00:55.686
simplify this radical by splitting it up into 16 times 3. The square root of 16

00:00:55.686 --> 00:00:59.766
equals 4, and then we can factor a 4 from our numerator to get 4 times 2 plus

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:05.361
or minus 1 root 3. Since a factor of 4 appears in the numerator and in the

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:09.142
denominator, we simplify one last time to get 2 plus or minus 1 root 3, all

00:01:09.142 --> 00:01:14.594
divided by 2. You might have also split this up into two separate fractions and

00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:19.400
had 2 divided by 2 plus or minus root 3 divided by 2. Of course, this 2 divided

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.154
by 2 simply reduces to 1. So these would have also been acceptable answers, 1

00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:27.135
plus or minus root 3 divided by 2.
