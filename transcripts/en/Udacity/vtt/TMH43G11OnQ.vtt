00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.240
In trying to define data visualization,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.990
I consulted some experts to learn more about the field.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.820
Here's what they had to say.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.550
Hi everyone.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.659
I'm here with Scott Murray.

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:10.590
Scott, could you introduce yourself?

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.300
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.170
I'm an assistant professor here at the University of San Francisco where I

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.790
teach in the design program.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.490
I teach some of our intro classes, but

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.360
I also teach interaction design and information visualization.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.020
And I'm author of the book Interactive Data Visualization for

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.940
the Web An Introduction to Designing with D3.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.970
&gt;&gt; So, Scott, what is data visualization?

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.270
&gt;&gt; Well there's obviously a lot of different possible answers to that.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.811
But I like to think about data visualization as mapping.

00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:41.290
Not sort of making geographic maps, like traditionally how we think about maps.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.040
But mapping values to visuals.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.300
So teach a class on information visualization, it's,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.060
it's sort of about information broadly, but when we're talking about data

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.010
visualization, I think of data as being kind of structured information.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.200
So if you have a spreadsheet, you have rows and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.210
columns, you have sort of information that's not just loosey goosey, but

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.830
it's organized in some sort of structured way.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.670
So the visualization part is taking that data and figuring out ways to

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.310
translate that into visuals that are more readily understood.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.270
So instead of reading these columns of numbers, we can look at you know,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.651
these pictures of bars, or lines, or shapes, or whatever, different colors.

00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:21.980
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.690
Hi everyone.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.370
I'm here with Cole Nussbaumer, who's a blogger with storytelling with data.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.008
She's here to share some insights about data visualization, and

00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:31.330
share some tips about how you can get started in the field.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.810
So Cole, first tell us, what is data visualization?

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.680
&gt;&gt; So for me data visualization is about turning numbers into pictures and

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.780
into stories.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.080
There's something about making data visual that allows us to explore and

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.800
understand the data in a different way.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.940
Our visual system is actually really fast at processing information.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.877
So good data visualization can lend itself to this sort of

00:01:58.877 --> 00:02:00.855
ha moment of understanding.

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:01.355
&gt;&gt; Great.
