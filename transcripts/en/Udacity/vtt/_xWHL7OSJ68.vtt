00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.380
Early data standards were a list,
such as medical diagnoses,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.370
laboratory tests, or medications.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.110
We refer to standards,
that is such a list as a classification.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.960
More recently, attention has been
paid to describing more detail and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.000
even relationships among
entities within a standard.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.750
We'll refer to a standard that can
code for relationships as an ontology.
