00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.498
&gt;From the class P we now
turn to the class NP.

00:00:03.498 --> 00:00:06.827
At the beginning of the lesson I said
that NP is the class of problems

00:00:06.827 --> 00:00:09.200
variable in polynomial time.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.500
This is true but
it's not how we typically define it.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.170
Instead, we define NP as the class of
problems solvable in polynomial time

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.330
on a nondeterministic Turing machine,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.800
a variant that we haven't
encountered before.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.590
Nondeterminism in computer
science is often misunderstood.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.250
So put aside whatever associations
you might have had with the word.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.400
Perhaps the best way to understand
nondeterministic Turing machines

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.560
is by contrasting a nondeterministic
computation with a deterministic one.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.370
A deterministic computation starts in
some initial state, and then the next

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.170
state is exactly and uniquely
determined by the transition function.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.130
There's only one possible
successor configuration.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.920
Into that configuration, there's
only one possible successor, and so

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.150
on, and so forth, until an accepting or

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.810
rejecting configuration is reached,
if one is reached at all.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.880
On the other hand,
in a nondeterministic computation,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.040
we start in a single initial
configuration, but it's possible for

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.200
there to be multiple
successor configurations.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.240
In effect, the machine is able to
explore multiple possibilities at once.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.750
This potential splitting
continues at every step.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.590
Sometimes, there might just be
one possible successor state.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.760
Sometimes there might be three or more.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.890
For each press, we have all
the same possibilities as for

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.240
the deterministic machine.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.060
The machine can reject,
it can loop forever, or it can accept.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.240
If the machine ever accepts
in any of these branches,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.050
then the whole machine accepts.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.330
The only change to the seven triple
definition of the deterministic

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.580
machine that we need to make is to
modify the transition function.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.370
The range is no longer a single state,
tape symbol being red,

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.800
direction tuple, but a whole
collection of such possibilities.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.470
The set of all subsets is
often called a power set.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.690
The only other change we need to
make is when the machine accepts.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.449
It accepts if there is any
valid sequence of configuration

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.120
that results in an accepting state.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.750
Naturally, it also rejects only when
every branch reaches a reject state.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.470
If there's a branch that
hasn't rejected yet,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.398
then we need to keep
computing in case it accepts.

00:02:23.398 --> 00:02:28.100
Therefore, a nondeterministic
machine that never accepts and

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.240
that loops on at least one branch,
will loop.
