00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.120
&gt;&gt; Good question, David. Novelty had use with newness,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.530
the unexpectedness had use with something non-obvious or surprising.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.050
Perhaps this will become clearer if I take an example. So in my deal, we

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.060
decide to entertain a group of 20 friends. We already know how to make soufflés

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.100
according to a particular recipe. We'll make soufflé for 20 friends this time.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.070
We have never made soufflé for 20 people, so something is novel, something new,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.300
something we haven't done earlier. On the other hand, we have known this recipe

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.640
for ages. Something unexpected would be if we come up with a new recipe for

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.040
this soufflé which taste dramatically different, surprisingly different.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.750
Not just something new, but something unexpected. So far we have been talking

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.660
about the product of creativity, the result of creativity, the outcome of

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.510
creativity. What about the process of creativity? You use it on here some and

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.000
other, both of these terms are important. Let's first look at the term other.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.840
In this course we've only talked about several processes of creativity.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.340
An analogical reasoning is a fundamental process of creativity. You already

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.440
explored an analogical reasoning in the context of designing. We just did

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.160
that when were talking about design thinking. One might be able to design a new

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.330
kind of water pump, but composing several water pumps in series if one can

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.976
analogically transfer a design factor from the domain of electrical circuits.

00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:15.650
Was a very good example. Similarly under analogical reasoning,

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.220
we were talking about the processes that might be used to come up with a model

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.700
the atomic structure the analogy to the model the solar system, which clearly is

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.890
a creative process that cuts across large number dimensions of space and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.790
time. Another place where we talked about creative processes was when we were

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.720
talking about explanation based learning. It seems creative, if the robot can go

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.240
to the kitchen, and use the flower pot as a cup to bring you coffee.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.650
Here are three other processes of creativity. Emergence, re-representation, and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.800
serendipity. A simple example of emergences. If I draw three lines. One, two,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.260
three. Then a triangle emerges out of it. The triangleness doesn't belong to any

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.590
single line. I was not even trying to draw a triangle. I just drew three lines,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.190
and a triangle emerged out of it. Emergence of the triangle to the drawing

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.360
the three lines is a kind of creativity. Re-representation occurs when

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.168
the original representation of the problem is not conducive to problem solving.

00:03:14.168 --> 00:03:18.980
So we re-represent the problem and then commence problem solving.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.901
To see an example of this. Let's go back to atomic structure and

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:27.210
solve this problem. Suppose that we have a model sort of system which uses

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.330
the word the planets revolve around the sun. You also have a model of the atom,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.030
and this uses the term the electron rotates around the nucleus.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.060
The model of the sun had the word revolve. The model of the atom has

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.580
the word rotates. The two vocabularies are different. If you were to stay with,

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.010
with this couple of sort of presentations mapping between rotate and reward

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.714
would be very hard. On the hand, suppose we were to re-represent this problem.

00:03:53.714 --> 00:03:57.750
Re-represent the atomic structure by growing the nucleus in the middle and

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.180
the electron around it. We represent the solar system by drawing the sun in

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.430
the middle and the earth around it. Then in this new representation,

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.432
we can see the similarity, we can do the mock-up.

00:04:09.432 --> 00:04:13.700
This re-representation is another fundamental process of creativity.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.170
Serendipity can be of many types and can occur in many different situations.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.790
One kind of serendipity occurs when I'm trying to address a problem but

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.140
I'm unable to address it. So I suspend the goal and I start doing

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.070
something different. Later, at some other time, I come across a solution, and

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.442
I connect it with the previous, suspended goal. The story has it that in 1941 in

00:04:37.442 --> 00:04:43.060
France, Josh Mistral's wife asked him to help her open a dress

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.220
by pulling on a zipper because it was stuck. Mistral struggled with the zipper,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.900
but couldn't pull it down. Later on one day, Mistral was walking his dog,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.545
when he found that some birds were stuck to the dog's legs. Curious about this,

00:04:56.545 --> 00:05:00.550
Mistral looked at the bird closely under the microscope,

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.190
he then connected the solution, the bird solution to the opening of

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.960
the zipper problem and out of that was born the notion of Velcro which you and

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.950
I now use on a common basis. But just like the word other was important here,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.400
these are three processes in addition to the process we already discussed in

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.250
this class. The word some is also important here.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.210
This is not an exhaustive list. There are in fact additional things we can add.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.660
For example, another potential process here is called conceptual combination.
