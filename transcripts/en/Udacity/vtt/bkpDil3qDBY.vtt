Selling 3 wiper sets would have given
Grant 3 times the cost of 1 wiper set,

00:00:04.829 --> 00:00:09.994
which would be 3w dollars. And selling 12
nozzles would have given him, well, 12n

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:15.387
dollars. We need to add these 2 quantities
together to get the total amount of money

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:20.564
that Grant would of made from all these
canceled orders. So our answer is just 3w

00:00:20.576 --> 00:00:20.902
+ 12n.
