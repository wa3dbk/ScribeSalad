What's more, the average webpage makes
a whopping 56 requests for images.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.640
Every one of those image requests
has a cost in terms of page load.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.195
And studies by Google, Amazon, and
others have shown that even very small

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:20.132
delays in loading pages can result in a
significant loss of traffic and revenue.

00:00:20.132 --> 00:00:25.075
Here we see from Google that
a 0.4 to 0.9 second increase

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:28.974
resulted in traffic and
ad revenues down by 20%.

00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:32.682
And for Amazon, every 100 millisecond

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:37.529
increase in page load time
means a loss of sales of 1%.
