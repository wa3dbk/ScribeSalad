00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.450
So, let's talk about
Development Workflow.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.200
Although details will be different
from organization to organization,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.510
the general ideas will stay the same.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.630
Developers just don't edit code
files on one big file server.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.790
They use version control systems
to track their changes and

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.130
keep them in sync.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.420
There are a bunch of different
version control systems out there, but

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.460
some of the most important ones these
days are Distributed VCS such as Git.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.990
When a developer writes their change,
they commit it to their fork or

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.550
branch of the project.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.905
Then, when their work is ready to be
merged in, they issue a pull request to

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:35.807
the main branch and request a code
review from their colleague.

00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:38.849
Then, once the review is done,
they can merge their change in.

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:42.100
So there are various points
that testing can happen.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.840
Developers can manually run tests on
their own code before code review or

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.550
as part of that process.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.730
Integration and full system tests
rely on running the whole service,

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.650
often on a testing server.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.900
After that, it's common practice to
deploy the changes to a staging server

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.330
for further tests.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.960
The difference between a test server and
a staging server is that

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.390
the latter resembles production
as closely as possible.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.650
For instance, having real data.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.130
And then, if everything goes well,
the build gets promoted to production.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.690
Depending on the application,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.790
it can be a good idea to
do rollouts incrementally.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.710
So that, even if,

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.120
after all this testing, the release
turns out to break the service.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.450
At least it doesn't
break all of it at once.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.240
Even if you never want
to have to use it,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.420
having the ability to
rollback is really important.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.920
As you can see, there were a fair
number of steps in this process.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.250
If the handover from every step to
another was manual, it would be slow and

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.910
potentially error prone.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.390
Slow manual processes
create bottlenecks and

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.740
errors create extra unplanned work
that uses up time to do planned work.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.980
So, by automating as much as we can, and

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.560
making sure that people can fix
the bottlenecks in their work process,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.120
DevOps practices can give us much more
time to do the actual productive work.
