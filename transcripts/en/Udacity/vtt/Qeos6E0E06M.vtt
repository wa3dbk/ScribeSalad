00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So let's up the ante and say we have a coin that has a certain probability

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of coming up with heads--again, it might be 0.5.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Just like before it will be an input to the function f and now I'm going to flip the coin 3 times

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and I want you to calculate the probability that the heads comes up exactly once.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Three is not a variable so you could only works for 3 flips not for 2 or 4

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but the only input variable is going to be the coin probability 0.5.

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So please change this code to express that number.
