00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.370
Here's nearly the same exact problem except this time we have a less than

00:00:04.382 --> 00:00:08.857
symbol. I'm going to solve this inequality just like before. First, 2x plus 1

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:13.486
can be less than 7 here or 2x plus 1 could be greater than negative 7 here. But

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:17.981
I don't have to solve these separately. I know 2x plus 1 is less than 7, but

00:00:17.993 --> 00:00:23.065
greater than negative 7. So it's in between these 2 numbers. Let's just write 1

00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:28.059
inequality and solve it. First I can subtract 1 from all 3 parts. This gives me

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:32.747
negative 8 is less than 2 x is less than 6. Now I just divide every part by 2.

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:37.767
So x is greater than negative 4 but less than 3. It's between these values. We

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:42.428
can see we get the numbers between negative 4 and 3. Using parentheses we can

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.258
include these point because we don't have an equal to by here. This would be the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.345
answer in interval notation. In the last problem we had a greater than symbol

00:00:50.357 --> 00:00:54.225
and we got the outside portions of the number line. For the less than symbol, we

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:58.337
get an intersection, the part in between. I hope this helps with your problem

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.768
solving.
