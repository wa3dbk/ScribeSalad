00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The answer is 1/4. It's easy to see that the probability of heads in step 2

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is the probability of heads in step 2 conditioned on heads in step 1

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
times probability of heads in 1

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
plus, that's the sum, probability of heads in step 2

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
given we had tails in step 1 times probability of tails in step 1.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, the way I set it up, those things here are equally likely.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
However, if we did have tails in step 1,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we would never toss the coin again and just accept it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's impossible that in step 2 I flip over the heads. It's probability zero.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Whereas if I found heads, I would flip again and then the 0.5 chance I arrive at heads.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If I look at this, then this all becomes zero,

00:00:54.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and these guys multiply to 1/4, and the final answer is 1/4.
