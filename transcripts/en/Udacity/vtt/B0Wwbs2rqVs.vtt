00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.457
For this quiz, I want you to explore how the meaning of an operation like plus

00:00:04.457 --> 00:00:08.674
depends on the type of its inputs. For each part below, give the type of the

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:12.822
result of a plus b, where the type of a is the type shown here, and the type of

00:00:12.822 --> 00:00:17.398
b is the type shown here. So for the first question, if you did plus where the

00:00:17.398 --> 00:00:22.190
two operands were both of type int, write the type of the result. So the fist

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.476
one, it's and int plus an int. Second one it's a int plus a float. Third one

00:00:27.476 --> 00:00:33.646
it's str plus a str. Fouth one it's a str plus an int. Fifth one is list plus a

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:36.786
list and the last one is dict plus a dict.
