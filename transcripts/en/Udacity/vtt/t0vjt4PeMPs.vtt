00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.419
When solving this inequality, we can add one to both sides to isolate the 3x.

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:08.661
Next, to isolate x, we divide each part by 3. So, we know x is greater than

00:00:08.673 --> 00:00:12.941
negative 3 but less than 7. But this isn't our answer. You want it to be an

00:00:12.953 --> 00:00:17.398
interval notation. We know x is between these values. So, I have negative 3 and

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.905
7, and I have parentheses on the end, because we can't be equal to negative 7 or

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:26.956
negative 3. Here's the solution on a number line. We're almost done with Unit 2.

00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:31.837
I hope so far, you've gained a stronger understanding of satisfying conditions

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.564
and learning when one condition or both conditions must be met. Let's wrap up

00:00:36.576 --> 00:00:41.538
this entire section with one last lesson, a lesson with absolute value equations

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.608
and inequalities.
