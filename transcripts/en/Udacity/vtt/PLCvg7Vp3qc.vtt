00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.752
A good example of this, relating to the brain, is a trait called Huntington's

00:00:04.752 --> 00:00:09.884
Disease. Huntington's disease, is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:15.140
muscle coordination and results in cognitive decline and psychiatric problems.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.460
Caused by a marked degeneration of brain tissue, that's visible in this

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.000
picture. Comparing a Huntington's Disease brain on the left to normal brain

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.572
tissue here on the right. Typically, Huntington's Disease becomes noticeable in

00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:38.049
mid adult life. So if the allele for Huntington's Disease is dominant. Then

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:42.401
which of the following allele combinations would result in someone who actually

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:50.434
displays Huntington's Disease? Remember, humans have two copies of every gene.

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:55.727
We'll represent the allele for Huntington's Disease with the letters HD and the

00:00:55.727 --> 00:01:02.422
allele for normal brain function with the abbreviation NORM. Would it be

00:01:02.422 --> 00:01:08.881
somebody who has two HD alleles. An individual with one HD and one NORM allele

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:14.776
or an individual with two NORM alleles. Go ahead and select any and all answers

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:16.910
that you think apply. [BLANK_AUDIO]
