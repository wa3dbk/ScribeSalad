00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.444
Now we have to think. Why did we want to come up with that equation in the first

00:00:04.456 --> 00:00:08.964
place? Think back to our original problem. We are trying to figure out the cost

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:13.320
to make one set of wiper blades. With our new equation, 598 equals 92c, that

00:00:13.332 --> 00:00:17.689
means finding out what number c needs to equal to make this equation true. So,

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.109
what kind of equation are we dealing with? With here.

00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:26.169
Is this a conditional equation, is it an identity, or is this not an equation at

00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:26.407
all?
