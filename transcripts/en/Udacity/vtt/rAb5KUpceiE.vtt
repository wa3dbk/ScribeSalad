00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.990
Many botnets use DNS for C&amp;C.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.760
A key advantage is that DNS is used
whenever a machine on the internet

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.610
needs to talk to another machine,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.200
because DNS stores the mapping
between domain name and IP address.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.380
That is DNS is always
allowed in a network.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.390
And therefore, using DNS for
C&amp;C won't stand out easily.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.320
In this example here,
the Botmaster releases malware and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.110
in the malware, the domain name
of the C&amp;C servers are coded.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.400
Have the malware spreads,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.470
then the question is, how do the bots
communicate back to the Botmaster?

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.006
In other words, how do they
perform C&amp;C with the C&amp;C server?

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:44.210
To perform C&amp;C, each bot is instructed
to communicate to the C&amp;C server.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.695
As we said, the C&amp;C server is
identified by the domain name.

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:51.330
So the first thing the bot will
do is ask the DNS server, hey,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.837
what's the IP address for hacker.com?

00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:57.320
And the DNS server will tell the bot,
here is the IP address.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.760
And then, the bots would actually
communicate to the C&amp;C server.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.060
And that's how Botnet C&amp;C
works through DNS.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.030
The kind of DNS service providers
preferred by the bot masses

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.280
are the dynamic DNS providers,
because they allow the frequent changes

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.660
of the mapping between domain name and
IP address.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.238
That is the Botmaster can
change to use another machine.

00:01:20.238 --> 00:01:23.822
User 10.0.0.1 for example,

00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:28.768
you can change it to 10.0.6.2 for
example.

00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:33.510
It's a C&amp;C server for the same botnet,
and all he needs to do is log into

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.770
the dynamic DNS provider and
change the map ping, so

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.440
that now hackers.com points
to the new IP address.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.930
If we can detect that hackers.com
is a useful botnet C&amp;C,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.780
then we can detect that any machine
that connects to it is a bot.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.190
But the question is, how do we know
that hackers.com is useful botnet C&amp;C?

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.740
It turns out that the way
that bots look up a domain

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.690
would suggest that this domain is
most likely used for botnet C&amp;C.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.110
That is, the way that bots look up
a domain would be different from

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.630
a machine that looks up a web server
because of legitimate use activities.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.530
Such as, when a user is
looking up a news website.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.340
For example, if a domain such as
hackers.com is being looked up

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.750
by hundreds of thousands of
machines all over the internet and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.900
yet this domain is
unknown to Google Search.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.530
This is an anomaly.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.900
Therefore, we can use anomaly detection
at the Dynamic DNS provider to examine

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.990
queries to DNS domains in order
to identify Botnet C&amp;C domains.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.730
Once we identify that
hackers.com is used for

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.960
Botnet C&amp;C, there are a number
of responses available.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.780
One option is for a Dynamic DNS provider

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.640
to send a mapping of hackers.com
to the IP address of a sinkhole.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.780
That is, instead of giving the IP
address of the C&amp;C machine to the bots,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.900
the dynamic DNS provider would give the
IP address of the sinkhole to the bots.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.370
Therefore, instead of connecting
to the actual C&amp;C server,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.920
all the bots will be connecting
to a sinkhole machine.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.927
As a result, the Botmaster will
not be able to command his bots.

00:03:15.927 --> 00:03:19.327
Because when he logs to the C&amp;C
server and looks through the logs,

00:03:19.327 --> 00:03:21.290
he will not be able to find the bots.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.180
Because all the bots are instead,
communicating with the sinkhole machine.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.690
With the sinkhole, in addition to
disabling the botnet operations,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.810
security researchers can
learn where the bots are.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.280
For example, by looking at each
connection from the bot to the sinkhole,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.440
security researchers would know
the IP address of each bot,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.900
therefore it would know where
the bots are throughout the Internet.
