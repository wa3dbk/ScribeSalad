00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so homework 1--what I'd like you to do is make a web page with a form on it

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that let's you ROT 13 some text.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
First, I'll explain what ROT 13 is.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Okay, so ROT 13 is a simple cipher to run a simple encryption algorithm on some text.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So it looks something like this.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Okay, if I were to take this string 'Hello' and apply ROT 13 to it,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
it would look like this--Uryyb.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What I've done is I've incremented every letter by 13.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So H becomes U. E becomes r. L becomes y. L becomes y, and o becomes b.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So if I had an alphabet like so--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
if I were to convert each letter, I increment them by 13.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So 'a' moves 13 spaces and becomes 'n' or 'h' moves 13 spaces and becomes 'u'.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
'z' wraps around moving 13 spaces and becomes 'm'.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So is you were to apply a Caesar cipher to itself,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you get the string you originally typed in.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's not the fanciest cipher in the world, but I'm not trying to test your cryptography skills.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There's another class for that.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm just trying to test your web handling skills.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let me show you what this should look like when it's all working.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Okay, so here's the app running on my appspot account at /unit2/ROT13.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If I type some text in this field and click submit,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
it rerenders this form with my text in the text box, and if I were to hit submit again,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
it converts it back to 'Hello".

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Okay, this is what I'd like you to build.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
A couple things to notice--1 is that it preserved case, so the capital H became a capital U

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and the lowercase 'ello' became the lowercase 'ryyb'.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'd also like you to preserve punctuation.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So I've expanded my text here to have an exclamation mark and a question mark.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
When I ROT 13 this, it preserves the exclamation mark and the question mark,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and everything else becomes ROT 13.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You know it's working because when you run it again,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
you get the original text.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'd also like you to preserve whitespace, okay?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I've added some whitespace and another exclamation mark and everything worked.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And, here's one thing to look out for.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Remember you might need to escape some HTML.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now this box here--this box for the text is using an element we haven't talked about.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's called a text area, and it's another form element for entering large pieces of text.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
If I were to include this in my text field and not escape it properly,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
we could have problems.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
But as you can see, I have escaped my less thans and greater thans properly,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
so everything works.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I can go back to text area, and all is well.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now this is running online, so you can verify what my expectations are

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
by playing around with my own version at this URL.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You can also if you want view the source of this page to see the HTML I was using

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
to draw the bigger box and that sort of thing.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It's fine if you want to use that.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
What I want you to do is implement the backend part, and once you have it working,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I'd like you to enter the full URL where it's running here.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Now when we grade this, it's a little challenging.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Obviously, we're not going to be able to grade how it looks.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We're going to have an automated script that submits some data and looks at the response.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Make sure you follow the notes below to have the correct input name,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
so when I submit directly to your form, I can find my text in the result.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Okay, good luck!
