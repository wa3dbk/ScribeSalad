00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.070
Now, you've got the skills to start
documenting your code with simply

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.110
readmes written in Markdown.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.939
If and when your code grows,
you may want to

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.990
explore other forms of documentation,
but this is a great place to start.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.010
Writing great code isn't just about
building something that works,

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.530
but building something that's both
easy to use and easy to maintain.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.220
If you're documenting your code,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.240
then you're writing code that's
meant to be used by humans.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.070
Being conscious of this fact beforehand
will make you a better developer.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.240
I'm going to leave you with a challenge.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.530
Go revisit some of the projects you've
built and write a readme for them.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.820
Make documentation a priority for
all your projects moving forward.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.620
You'll thank yourself later.
