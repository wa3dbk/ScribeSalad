00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.127
And the car hierarchy you've just seen, makes it easy to understand the

00:00:03.127 --> 00:00:06.466
concepts of super and sub classes but it doesn't make for a very interesting

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:12.044
implementation, instead let's look at quizzes. In a quiz, you can have different

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:17.808
kinds of questions so it's natural to have a super class question. And then,

00:00:17.808 --> 00:00:21.915
you may have various sub classes. Maybe a question where you need to fill in a

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:25.490
missing word, or a question where you're given a bunch of choices, or one where

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.900
you've to supply a number, but it might be okay if it's not exactly the right

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:36.196
answer. A numeric question might take round off into account. And so on. You

00:00:36.196 --> 00:00:41.494
could even think that there is a, sub-class of choice question. I'll call it a

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:44.896
Multi Choice Question, you know, one of those where you need to supply all of

00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:50.594
the choices that are correct. What do our questions have in common? They all

00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:54.314
need to be able to display themselves, and the display may be as simple as

00:00:54.314 --> 00:01:00.690
showing the question text, or it might have to have a list of choices. Or an

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.045
underscore at the right place for filling in a word, and also any question

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:09.232
needs to be able to check its answer. That might be a string comparison or a

00:01:09.232 --> 00:01:15.820
number comparison that's, or a number comparison after some accuracy. So the

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.308
idea is that, the super-class question will give reasonable implementations of

00:01:20.308 --> 00:01:24.532
these methods, and the sub-classes can modify them if they don't work for the

00:01:24.532 --> 00:01:30.504
context of the sub-classes. I've implemented the question class for you, and

00:01:30.504 --> 00:01:33.960
here is a programming problem that's designed to make you familiar with that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.928
class. So that you can form sub-classes, as we go, go along. Here's the

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:43.732
question class. Have a look at it's methods, as you answer the next programming

00:01:43.732 --> 00:01:48.454
question. And here is a demo program, in which I want you to fill in some

00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:54.550
details. Make a question object, and then there is a method present question.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.940
That displays a question, gets the user response, checks whether was correct.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.648
They're methods for displaying and for checking a response. And I want you to

00:02:04.648 --> 00:02:08.389
look them up and call them.
