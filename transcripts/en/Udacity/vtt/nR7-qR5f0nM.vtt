00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.040
So the application of the last move in the previous shot will bring us to this

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.070
state. In this state the the sub-goal C over D has been achieved. Now that we've

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.408
achieved the first sub-goal, we can worry about achieving the other sub-goals.

00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:20.360
The other sub-goals, recall, were B over C and A over B. Given this as

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.180
the current state and this as the goal state. Please write down the sequence of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.340
operations that will take us from the current state to the goal state.
