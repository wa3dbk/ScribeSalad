00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The correct answer here is no.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Suppose we let "x" go to infinity,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
then x-Mu2 for any fixed Mu would go to infinity.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.750
So if x with a -infinity would go to zero--

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.000
because it is a constant--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Therefore, we know that in the limit of x goes to infinity--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.750
this expression must be zero.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.000
However, in this graph--it stays at alpha, and doesn't go to zero--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, therefore, there can't be a valid Mu at sigma square.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If a deep improbability, you know that the area in the Gaussian

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
has to integrate into one,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and this area diverges, it is actually infinite in size,

00:00:41.000 --> 09:59:59.000
so it's not even a valid execution.
