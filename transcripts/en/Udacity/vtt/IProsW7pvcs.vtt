00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.430
So let's talk about the role of
the storage in a computer system.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.620
It keeps all the files, the programs,
the data, all the settings,

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.810
the operating system, everything.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.586
And also,

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:16.940
our virtual memory is implemented using
storage because we cannot fit all

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.481
the data that the application actually
wants to access to physical memory.

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:26.498
Some of those pages are actually on
disk and when the program accesses them,

00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:29.480
they're loaded into the physical memory.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.290
But meanwhile, they're sitting in our
storage, for example, on our disk.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.700
So storage is important, not only
to keep data, but also to extend

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.090
our virtual memory so that we think we
have more memory than we actually have.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.720
For both uses of storage,
we care about performance,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.690
mainly throughput and latency.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.563
Throughput is how many bytes per
second can we get out of our, for

00:00:57.563 --> 00:00:58.652
example, disk.

00:00:58.652 --> 00:01:05.110
Latency, once we request a page of data,
when are we going to get it back?

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.370
And then storage, this is improving, but

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.440
not as quickly as the processor
speed is improving,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.850
whereas the latency is improving,
but very slowly.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.260
The reduction in storage
latency is even slower

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.990
than the reduction in DRAM latency.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.100
So processor are getting faster and
faster.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.540
DRAM is getting faster but
lagging behind processors and

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.905
becoming slower and slower,
relative to the processors, and

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:40.030
then storage is falling
further behind DRAM itself.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.680
In addition to performance, we are also
really concerned with reliability.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.070
If our processor fails, our system
temporarily doesn't work until we

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.000
replace the processor, but then we can
boot up the system and it works again.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.570
But if our disk fails,
we lose our programs, data settings,

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.090
etc., which is much, much worse
than just a processor failing.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.660
So we are much more worried about
the reliability of our storage

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.290
than we are about most of the other
elements of our computer system.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.740
And finally, the types of storage
that we can use are very diverse.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.410
We can have magnetic disks,
our traditional hard drives,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.680
optical disks such as CDs and
DVDs, tape for backup,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.090
flash drives that are much faster than
most of the other ones, and so on.
