00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.160
Joe Kraus came to speak at Wycominator.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.980
He was the previous founder of Xsite,
an old search engine company.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.280
And then eventually he did his own
new start called JotSpot at the time,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.530
which was this freemium
software-as-a-service wiki company.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.910
And they had set up pricing and
in his talk at YC, it just made sense.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.640
It was like, oh, we thought about
pricing where the top end tier of

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.150
the pricing would be stuff that
people didn't need to get.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.968
Permission from legal or financial or
get a special document or

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:32.326
review done, that people can just
pay it on the corporate credit card.

00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:33.440
$200 a month, he said.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.490
It seems to be what the limits are for
that.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.390
And then we step down the features
based on the usage, downwards.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.220
And then we always knew we
wanted to have a freemium plan.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.110
Or a free plan that people can try
out the service because we felt like

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.070
our user experience was going
to be what sells a lot of

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.122
what sells a lot of what Wufoo does.

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:53.810
Although I think completely
different about that now when

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.920
I advise companies about going freemium.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.984
But that's how it started,
it's just starting with his price and

00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:01.293
that made sense and
then we figured out the tiers.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:03.784
Where it was going to be the cutoff for
the functionality,

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:05.696
just based on looking
at our competitors.

00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:07.430
Here's what they do,
can we be more generous?

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.420
Do we have a guess on what's going to
me us different or what have you?

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.110
And I think one of the best things that
we did is we offered plans that offered

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.310
unlimited forms.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.500
Because it was this idea, you get
them hooked into this idea that you

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.840
can use forms for
anything and everything.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.610
And yes,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.670
everyone's going to come in on one
vertical or one very specific use case.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.740
But if you have the idea,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.050
it's like oh, there's an unlimited
resource of these things.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.660
Which it kind of truly is, because the
marginal cost of building another form,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.100
allowing people to make another one,
costs us nothing.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.840
And so it's easy to be generous on that.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.140
But what we want to do is hook them in,
where now everyone in the organization

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.530
using Wufoo for
all different kinds of uses cases.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.248
And then they start thinking about
problem solving in the Wufoo ways,

00:01:48.248 --> 00:01:52.105
like I can use Wufoo for this, I can
do this for this, or do this for this.

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:55.832
And then that's what makes a
subscription business do really well is

00:01:55.832 --> 00:02:00.021
that when people start relying you on in
a long term relationship sort of way.

00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:02.473
It's like this is a long
term solution for

00:02:02.473 --> 00:02:05.076
lots of different
problems in the company.

00:02:05.076 --> 00:02:08.078
I think what's tricky is Wufoo's one
of those generalized products where it

00:02:08.078 --> 00:02:09.900
could be used for
lots of different stuff.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.630
We had every industry,
market or vertical using Wufoo.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.150
And that is because forms is the first
step of interaction of collecting data,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.970
interacting with people.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.850
Creativity was always
our biggest problem.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.670
People not knowing
what do I do with this.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.680
It sounds neat but how do I utilize it?

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.290
So we spent a lot of time
on education to get people

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.980
get hooked on in their first use case,
so

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.110
that way they'll eventually
learn the other ways to use it.
