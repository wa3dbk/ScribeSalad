00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
How about we take a look at a seemingly simple little puzzle.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.500
Let's say we have a list of string pairs.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.450
So a pair b, aabb, and a pair bba, abb, and so on, and we have some number of these pairs.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.710
My question is, can we select from these pairs so that the 1st strings form the same strings

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.710
as the 2nd strings?

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.330
Let me show you an example to let you know what I mean.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.369
Let's pick these pairs in the following order: The 3rd one, the 2nd one, the 4th one,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.690
the 2nd one again, the 3rd one again, and finally the 1st one.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.960
If we do that, and we can catenate the 1st string in the pair and can catenate the 2nd strings

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.210
in the pair, then we get this string.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.340
If you look at these, then they are equal.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.550
Beit they're cut in different places.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.320
We take the 3rd one first, and we start with aabb and aa.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.880
Then we take the 2nd one, bba here, abb here, and so on.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.410
This problem, whether or not we can do this with a given set of strings,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.430
is called the post correspondance problem or PCP,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.430
after the logician Emil Post who first posed it.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.630
Here is the really mindblowing part.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:23.170
It turns out that any computer program can be stated as a PCP using just 7 pairs of strings.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.490
Now I'd like you to tell me what this means from the given list of statements.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.730
Does it mean that PCP is generally undecidable for 7 pairs of strings or more?

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.400
Or does it mean PCP is generally decidable for 6 pairs of strings or less?

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.230
Any SAT problem can be transformed into a PCP using 7 strings.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.350
And finally, no PCP instance with 7 pairs of strings or more is decidable.

00:01:46.350 --> 99:59:59.000
Check whichever statements you feel are true.
