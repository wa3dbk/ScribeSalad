00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.080
We have been expanding expressions, so now let's condense them. This is

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.850
effectively the reverse of expanding. How about we play around with this

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.952
expression? 3 natural log of x plus 4 minus the natural log of 5. Now a common

00:00:13.952 --> 00:00:18.480
mistake in trying to condense this, would be to start off using the quotient

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.730
property, but we're not ready for that just yet. To do that we would need both

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.990
terms to just be the log of something, and not have a coefficient in front. But

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.960
how do we get rid of this coefficient, please rewrite this first term so that

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.620
the coefficient is no longer there.
