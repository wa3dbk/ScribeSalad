00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, I'd like to ask you about what happens as the number of flips

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or events, in general, becomes a very large number.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Check all that apply. The probability of every individual sequence becomes small

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The probability of every number of heads becomes small.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So for example, does the probability of having one head or hundred heads or million heads,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
any specific number does that becomes small.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Does the probability of every given proportion, for example, one head out of 100 flips,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
10 heads out of 100 flips or 1500 heads out of a billion flips becomes small.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Does every given range of proportions have a smaller and smaller probability.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Are there some ranges of proportions for which the probability becomes small as we have many flips.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Check all that apply. Also, assume that the probability of heads is neither 0 or 1.

00:01:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That is, we can get both heads and tails from this coin.
