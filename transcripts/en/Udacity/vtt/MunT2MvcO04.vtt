00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.000
Okay.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.020
Let's see where these fit in.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.010
Let's start with GitHub.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.520
GitHub is a service that let's users interact with Git.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.970
There are couple of different ways that we could've represented this.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.970
Maybe GitHub operates on Git, or maybe even that GitHub refers to Git.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.590
But I chose to represent it as Git being a part of GitHub.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.540
Now let's think about remotes.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.340
A remote in your local repository is basically a reference to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.500
another repository, so we can say that remote refers to repositories.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.720
Also when you clone a repository, a remote gets set up for

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.710
you automatically, so we can say that clone operators on remotes.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.660
So remote goes here.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.570
At this point the remaining two spots are exactly the same.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.470
They both operate on both remote and branch.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.830
So we could put these in either spot.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.630
Let's check that this actually makes sense.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.600
When you push or pull, you have to specify what branch you want to push or pull.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.810
So, it definitely operates on branches.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.420
Pull takes a branch from a remote and brings it to your local repository.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.360
And push does the opposite, taking a branch and pushing it to a remote.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.240
So these do both operate on a remote as well.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.460
All right.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.180
We now have our Concept Map up to this point.
