When thinking about solving this problem, we know that the insides can both be

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:07.943
positive numbers, so we leave them alone. We also said that they could both be

00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:11.796
negative. Remember, a negative number equaling a negative number. But this

00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:15.419
equation is the same one we just had. We've just multiplied both sides by

00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:19.422
negative 1, so I don't need to solve this. The other case we had was a positive

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:23.188
number and a negative number. This second number or this expression could be

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.576
negative, or we could have this first number be negative, and that case this

00:00:27.588 --> 00:00:31.941
first part would be negative. But notice, if I multiply both sides by a negative

00:00:31.953 --> 00:00:36.306
1, this side will become positive and this side will become negative. So this is

00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:40.488
the same equation, I don't need to solve it. Whenever we solve the absolute

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.706
value on both sides, we always write 2 equations. We keep both sides positive

00:00:44.718 --> 00:00:49.767
and then we multiply one side by a negative. And again, it doesn't matter which

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:54.002
side has the negative, usually we make the second one the negative. Alright, to

00:00:54.014 --> 00:00:58.187
wrap up this problem, what's the solution set to this absolute value equation?

00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:00.207
Be sure to write your answer as a set.
