00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.198
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Try figuring out what type of system this is. You can solve each equation for

00:00:04.198 --> 00:00:08.162
y and then think about their slopes and the y intercept. If the slopes are

00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:12.387
different they intersect, if they're the same they're parallel, or you might

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:16.770
just have the same equation, which means you know you're in the last case. Good

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.105
luck.
