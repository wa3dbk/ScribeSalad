00:00:00.126 --> 00:00:02.763
A picture is worth a thousand words,
right?

00:00:02.763 --> 00:00:06.440
So I want to show you a few
examples that will help you develop

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.321
the right mindset for
creating better forms.

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:11.259
This is an example that is good.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.549
Notice how it is quick to finish.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.897
Notice the placeholders.

00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:19.503
The fonts are visible and big enough.

00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:21.412
Notice the progress bar.

00:00:21.412 --> 00:00:24.094
And this is an example that is not so
good.

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:26.742
Notice how it is hard to finish.

00:00:26.742 --> 00:00:29.481
Notice that you don't see any progress.

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:31.257
The font is too small.

00:00:31.257 --> 00:00:35.130
I hope you noticed the patterns
that well-designed forms share.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.210
In the next video,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.067
Cam and I will summarize the principles
of a well-designed forms.
