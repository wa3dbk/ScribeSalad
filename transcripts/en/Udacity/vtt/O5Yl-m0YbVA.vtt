00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.990
In cases 4 and 5, your node's parent
is red and its sibling is black.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.660
In both,
you'll need to perform a rotation.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.000
In a rotation, you shift a group of
nodes around in a way that changes

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.970
the structure of the tree, but
not the order of the nodes.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.770
Keep in mind that this is still a BST,
so,

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.178
we need to keep our
elements in strict order.

00:00:23.178 --> 00:00:26.770
In case 4, our red node and

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.600
its red parent are not on
the same side of their parents.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.410
Our node is a right child and
its parent is a left child.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.650
Here we will perform a left
rotation since the nodes shift

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.239
one place to the left while
maintaining their order.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.349
At this point, we have a set up that
looks exactly like case 5, where

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.900
both the red node and its red parent
are on the same side of their parents.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.400
Here, that's the left.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.110
We'll do a right rotation here,
but this time,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.650
involving the grandparent and
both of its children.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.495
We need to swap the colors
of these two nodes as well.

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:09.178
Ta-da!

00:01:09.178 --> 00:01:12.660
We have rearranged the nodes without
changing the number of black nodes

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.250
in any path.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.460
Those are all of the cases
that could arise in insertion.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.900
Again, we just needed to do some clever
rearranging to keep our red black tree

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.800
and BST properties satisfied.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.310
In doing the rotations,

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.700
we kept any one sub-tree from
getting much larger than the others.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.364
Insert, like search and delete, is log
of n in the average and worst cases.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:44.270
BSTs were o of n in the worst case
because they could be unbalanced.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.679
Because we're careful about
staying balanced here,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.350
the run time won't be that large.
