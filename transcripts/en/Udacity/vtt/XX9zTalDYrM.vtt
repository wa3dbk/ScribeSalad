00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.250
Now if we check our code, you'll see that we have an error.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.280
You can find the error at the bottom of the page.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.070
What it says is that element head is missing a required instance of

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.950
child element title.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.820
What this means is that the head elements needs to

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.820
have a child element called title.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.150
So if we go back to our code.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.700
So within our head elements, if we add a child element called title,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.842
we can then say something like favorite app,

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:32.406
and then re-verify the code, and we're now okay.
