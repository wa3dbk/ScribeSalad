00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.994
Here our solutions set is negative 2 and positive 6. That's amazing work if

00:00:04.994 --> 00:00:09.597
you've found those two answers. First we want to square both sides of our

00:00:09.597 --> 00:00:14.696
equation. 2 squared equals 4, times the quantity 2x plus 4, since the square of

00:00:14.696 --> 00:00:20.524
this square root is simply what's inside here. On the right side, we'll square

00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:26.040
the binomial x plus 2 to get this expression. Next we'll distribute the 4 to

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.073
get 8x plus 16 on the left, and our same expression on the right. We want to

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:36.178
set our quadratic equal to 0, so we subtract 8x from both sides, and we

00:00:36.178 --> 00:00:43.002
subtract 16 from both sides. This leaves us with 0 equals x squared minus 4x

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:48.535
minus 12. Now, we're ready to try and factor. We find factors of negative 12

00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:54.165
that sum to negative 4. Those factors are negative 6, and positive 2. We set

00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:57.850
each factor equal to 0 to get x equals 6, or x equals negative 2 as our

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.671
potential solutions to the original radical equation. Finally, we check each of

00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:09.699
the solutions in the original equation and discover they both check. This means

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:13.542
we can include both of these numbers in our answer to have our final solution

00:01:13.542 --> 00:01:14.839
set.
