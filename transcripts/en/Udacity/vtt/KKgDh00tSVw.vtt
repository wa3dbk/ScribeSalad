00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And the correct answer is after 10--the sum of all these things over here

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
up to the 10th are 0.012 approximately.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There's a slight truncation issue here that gets some work with number and is far away from 5%,

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which will be 0.05, but if you're now were to add this guy over here, you'll go beyond 0.05.
