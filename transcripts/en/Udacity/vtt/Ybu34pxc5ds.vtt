00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.814
The flight for Las Vegas won't change and the flight to New York City won't

00:00:03.814 --> 00:00:08.794
change, but the flight to Chicago will be less this time. When we write the

00:00:08.794 --> 00:00:13.247
condition this way, the original price 100 will not be less than 100, so it

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:19.826
will go into the L's and subtract 20. Whereas before, it went into the L's and

00:00:19.826 --> 00:00:25.350
subtracted only 10. For the threshold value, it matters whether we say original

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.394
price is greater than 100 or original price is less than 100. Even if we switch

00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:36.512
the if and else clauses because it changes which group 100 falls in.
