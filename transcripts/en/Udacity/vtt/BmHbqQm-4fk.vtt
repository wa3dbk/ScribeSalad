00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.460
Okay, back to the rendering
process of a single frame.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.550
Once the browser knows which
rules apply to an element,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.810
it can begin calculate layout.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.900
Or it, in other words,
how much space elements take up and

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.380
where they are on the screen.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.470
So, here's all the CSS
that we want to apply.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.840
And layout turns this into
a collection of boxes like this.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.730
In the tooling,
you'll see this as layout.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.880
The web's layout model means that
one element can affect others.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.080
So, for example, the width of body

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.910
typically affects the children's widths
and so on, all the way down the tree.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.100
So the process can be quite involved for
the browser.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.550
Sometimes, you may hear
layout called reflow.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.130
It's the same thing.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.970
The next step in the process is
to talk about vector to raster.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.030
For example, the boxes we had before
were vectors like this, just shapes.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.830
But now what we need to do is fill
in individual pixels, like this.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.630
And that's what a rasterizer is for.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.150
So, this is the layout we had before,
and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.262
these are the draw calls that
the rasterizer will make to fill it in.

00:01:06.262 --> 00:01:09.012
When done, it will look like this.

00:01:09.012 --> 00:01:12.032
But that's a little too quick,
so let's step through and

00:01:12.032 --> 00:01:14.012
see it build up the picture bit by bit.

00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:18.010
So you can see, these rectangles
start to appear, then some text.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.740
And we get a shadow, a white line,
a picture, and finally it tightens up.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.929
The tooling is going to
show you this as paint.

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.382
You may have noticed in that previous
list that one of the calls was called

00:01:33.382 --> 00:01:34.262
draw bitmap.

00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:38.461
What we normally do is we
send things like JPEGs, or

00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:41.595
PNGs or GIFs down the wire to our page.

00:01:41.595 --> 00:01:46.179
But what the browser has to do is
decode these into memory, like this.

00:01:50.804 --> 00:01:53.870
In the tooling,
you'll see it as image decode.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.900
Potentially, we're doing something
like responsive web design.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.580
And so the image may also need resizing.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.040
Painting, as you may have noticed just
now, was done into a single surface.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.288
However, sometimes browsers make
multiple surfaces called layers or

00:02:09.288 --> 00:02:12.820
compositor layers and
it can paint into those individually.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.970
So here I have a site and
this masthead has its own layer.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.595
That means we can paint
the concept behind.

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:21.929
And we can paint the masthead itself.

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:25.222
The process of handling these
layers is shown in the tooling as

00:02:25.222 --> 00:02:26.830
composite layers.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.140
This masthead is a layer, but
because we have buttons for

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.585
next and previous on top of it they
are also turned into layers as well.

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:39.095
In this course, we're going to
talk about layer management

00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:43.295
to make sure that you don't
create extra layers by accident.

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:45.595
Now, we can put all these
layers back together.

00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:48.887
And so now we've finished painting
all the layers for our page.

00:02:48.887 --> 00:02:53.080
To be honest, painting actually happens
into a grid of tiles like this.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.470
I mentioned it for completeness, but

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.900
it's not something we get
to control as developers.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.770
All of this happened on the CPU.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.150
The layers themselves and
their tiles will be uploaded to the GPU.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.250
Again, this will be included
in composite layers.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.980
And lastly, the GPU will be instructed
to put the pictures up on the screen.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.360
And that, in brief,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.530
is how we get from a single request all
the way through to pixels on screen.
