00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.555
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The vertex in this case is the lowest point since our parabola opens upward.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:13.551
That lowest point or the minimum is at 1,-9. The x-intercepts are at 4,0 and

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:20.045
-2,0. As we can see from where the graph intersects the x axis and the curve

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:26.508
hits the y axis at the point 0. Negative 8, so that is the y intercept.
