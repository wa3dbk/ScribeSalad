There's one other feature of cameras that I'm going to mention in passing here.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.764
Depth of field. This is the idea of simulating a real camera, where you can

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:10.695
focus the lens to be at a particular distance. In depth of field algorithms,

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:13.401
you control the focal distance and also how blurry objects will appear when not

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:18.401
in focus. This type of algorithm is often done as a post-process. In other

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:21.239
words, data is collected by rendering the scene, then image processing of some

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.883
sort is used on this data to produce the final depth of field image. The

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:28.384
difficult part is getting objects in the foreground to be blurry and also

00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:32.581
properly blend with the objects in focus behind them. 3JS has a demo showing a

00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.790
depth of field effect. It may show up a bit dark here. So see the additional

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.320
course materials for the link and give it a try. It avoids the problem of

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.811
blurry foreground objects by putting the focus nearby. So that only distant

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:47.596
objects are fuzzy. There are other less expensive techniques you can do to get

00:00:47.596 --> 00:00:51.080
a depth of field effect. Here's a simple tilt shift post process that gives

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.720
foreground and background blur. No scene information is used. A variable blur

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.620
is just added to the top and bottom of the final image.
