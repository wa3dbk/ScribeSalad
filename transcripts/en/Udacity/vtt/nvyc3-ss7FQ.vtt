00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.765
First graph A was shifted to the right by 1 unit. We can see that based on

00:00:05.765 --> 00:00:10.774
where the x intercepts are in graph A. They're at negative 2, negative 1, 1 and

00:00:10.774 --> 00:00:17.538
2. And then in graph B they're at negative 1, 0, 2 and 3. So they all shifted

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:21.632
over by 1 to the right. The final transformation that's happening here is the

00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:26.164
graph is reflected in the x axis. We can see that here, the ends are both

00:00:26.164 --> 00:00:29.729
pointing upward, and here they're both pointing downward.
