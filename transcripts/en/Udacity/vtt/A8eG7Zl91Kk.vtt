00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is the first choice. Alice needs to validate--sorry.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
My answer is the first choice. The bank needs to validate the hashes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It needs to know the preimage for the hash. It's enough to get just one of those.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It isn't necessary to get both of them because the bank presumably starts knowing Alice's identity.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If the bank doesn't start knowing Alice's identity,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
then anyone could create a bill that would blame Alice for double spending.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So if the banks knows Alice's identity, then the bank can compute the other part of this

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
computing xk1 by XORing this value with Alice's identity

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and they can check if both of the hashes are correct.

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If they are, that validates that each of these identity components is correct.
