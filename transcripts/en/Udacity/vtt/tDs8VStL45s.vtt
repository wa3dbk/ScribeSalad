00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.580
Enabling auto tracking on all activities
is a quick way to get started

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.440
with Google Analytics, but
it's not always the best approach.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.750
You should think about what data
you really want to track, and

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.310
code your app to track the data
that's important to you.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.610
In this lesson, we look at how to
track data about what your users do

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.180
by sending specific screen and
event hits.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.910
We'll look into tracking goals to see if
users are completing the app objectives.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.500
We'll delve into tracking
Ecommerce there to see if users

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.300
are spending money.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.790
And then we'll take a quick look
at how to send timing data, and

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.070
how to track crashes and exceptions.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.910
We'll finish the lesson with
a discussion of tracking how users

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.170
download your app.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.250
It's always good to know.
