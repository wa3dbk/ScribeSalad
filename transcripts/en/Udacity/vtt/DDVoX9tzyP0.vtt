00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.840
To produce a production ready version
of our site, we can skip the whole live

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.650
editing and watching, and include
the scripts distribution task instead.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.160
Nothing easier than that.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.390
Let's call the new task dist and include
the following tasks in that order.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.470
Copy html.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.730
Copy images.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.780
Styles.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.670
Lint.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.820
And finally scripts-dist.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.144
Try running the tasks
via gulp scripts-dist.

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:26.040
If gulp takes slightly longer, and
exists without opening the browser,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.600
you're all set, and have a production
ready distribution in your dist folder.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.420
Before we continue, one word of
advice regarding minification.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.290
Minification on its own is great,
but GZIP is even more affective.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.890
GZIP compresses the file before it
gets in, and out to the browser,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.140
and the browser deflates it.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.300
All of this happens transparently
in the background and

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.670
usually only requires a small
server configuration change.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.350
