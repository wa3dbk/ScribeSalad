00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's now apply what we just learned in the context of computing an actual confidence interval.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Suppose I care about 90% confidence and from my coin flips,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I get a data sequence of 5 elements 11000 and let's for now assume you're going to use the T table.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This might not be the world's most accurate method but for now we do this.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now we've computed the variance many times. I'm just going to give it to you.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This 0.24 and if I knew this five takes the square root of the variance over n is about 0.219.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You compute this so many times, these are just the numbers, but I want you to give me

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
is the confidence intervals, which is the mean plus or minus the term on the right.
