00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.139
And the order of the letters that you should have is b equals a times c plus d.

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:08.246
However, you could also have a and c switched here. Of course, because of the

00:00:08.246 --> 00:00:12.706
commutative property of multiplication. Doesn't matter whether we multiply the

00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:16.541
number of nozzles by the cost to make each nozzle or the cost to make each

00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:21.252
nozzle by the number of nozzles made. Either way you have it. This equation says

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:25.875
that the total amount that Grant will spend on nozzle production depends both on

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:30.222
how much he spends on the new machinery to allow for that production, and how

00:00:30.222 --> 00:00:34.942
much he spends in buying products to make each nozzle. Please notice what we're

00:00:34.942 --> 00:00:39.468
looking for the problem in the end is the quantity d over here. The cost of new

00:00:39.468 --> 00:00:44.312
machinery to Grant. And although it's not by itself an equation yet, you can use

00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:48.994
your algebra skills to pretty easily rearrange things so that d is by itself.
