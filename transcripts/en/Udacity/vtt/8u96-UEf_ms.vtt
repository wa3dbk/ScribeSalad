00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.830
One of the most common reasons for incorrectly interpreting data

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.400
stems from the difference between correlation and causation.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.274
If we use some logical notation borrowed from math,

00:00:14.274 --> 00:00:20.720
a correlation can simply be stated as both A and B either go up or down.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.861
You could also have an anti-correlation, where when A goes up, B goes down.

00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:32.980
The difference with causation is typically one event happens before the other.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.396
In this case, if A, then B.

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:40.994
In this case, causation is often a much

00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:46.454
stronger assumption in effect than merely a correlation.

00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:50.690
To make this a little bit more concrete, I want to go through a simple example.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.190
Let's say that as the number of movies produced in a year increases,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.790
the observed incidence of cancer in a population increases as well.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.640
Now, you might be able to say that as the number of movies produced increases,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.110
people go to the movies more often and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.100
thus exercise less, increasing cancer incidence in the population.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.330
And while that may be true, an analyst might

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.920
conclude a stronger relation between the number of movies produced and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.040
cancer incidence in a population to be a causation instead,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.660
perhaps leading to some serious actions being taken erroneously.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.320
If the relation between movies produced and cancer is completely spurious, and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.500
the true cause of the cancer incidence increase is due to

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.470
some completely separate event.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.800
If the results that the analyst found are presented either on potentially wrong

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.720
media, let's say an academic paper, rather than simply on their personal blog or

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.740
maybe in an article, some serious consequences might be

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.810
taken based off of, again, the spurious correlation.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.280
Let's say the doctor sees a paper published based on this connection in relation

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.500
that some analyst found, and then decides to recommend to all of his patients to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.080
stop watching all movies and TV because it increases cancer incidence.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.580
By misinterpreting a correlation to, in fact,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.240
be causation could lead to many misleading conclusions, and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.070
thus, serious consequences that others might take based on those conclusions.
