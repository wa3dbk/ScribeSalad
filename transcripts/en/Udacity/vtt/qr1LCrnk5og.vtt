00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
With this homework we're back to Scrabble, and we're tackling the problem of blank tiles.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You probably thought this was coming.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We talked about blank tiles as we were trying to design the program.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If you remember back to playing poker, I threw the problem of Jokers at you.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Blank tiles are similar to Jokers.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
They can be played, and any letter can take the place of the blank tile.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You get to choose which letter you want to replace this with.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But we can't use exactly the approach that we used with Jokers

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of saying well let's just try all 26 possibilities one at a time without changing the code

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and then just take the maximum play over the those, say,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because the scoring rules are different.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Suppose we wanted to play the word SWAY.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We could use the blank tile to form a Y,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but if we had a real Y tile, that would worth 4 points, whereas if we have a blank Y tile

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that's worth zero points in terms of the letter score.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We can't just replace it as-is. We have to keep track of the scoring.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We have a question of how we're going to represent the blanks.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now, I'm going make some of that choice for you.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'm going to say that in the hand, which is the string of seven characters,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the blank tile is going to be represented by an underscore.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
On the board, when you finally decide what you're going to play--

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
let's say you decide that the blank is going to be represented by a Y--

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we're going to go ahead and represent that as a capital letter Y,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
because once it's played, it fully takes on the affect of the letter it replaces.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So somewhere from going to the hand to going to the board,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the blank changes from an underscore to a capitalized letter,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but in between it's up to you.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now, as the program progresses, we call best_play, which calls all_plays,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and at some point we're going to call calculate_score.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It's up to you to decide what format and what type of data you want to pass to each of those functions.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
One possibility is you can maintain the underscore as representation for a blank.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
At some point you might want to swap over and use the capital letter that you've chosen

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to replace it with.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You also have the option of using a lowercase letter,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and that has the advantage of, one, it tells you what letter I've chosen,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but also it distinguishes the lowercase letter, which represents a blank and would score zero

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
from the uppercase letter which does not represent a blank and would score 4.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You decide which combinations of these you want

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and which functions you have to modify in order to successfully make the best play,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the best choice for using a blank or not using it if the best play is to not use

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
a blank in your hand to score the maximum number of points.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Here are some examples. Here's the directions for what you should do.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Assume that all the code is loaded,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and just write the functions and maybe updates to variables that you need.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Then make sure you can pass at least these tests,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
but you probably should try out some additional tests of your own.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Make sure that you haven't broken best_play() and that it still gets the same result

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
for the test that we did before.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
When one letter is a blank you actually score a little bit less,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Because the A scores no letter points.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Now, I've chosen to show here the lowercase letter to indicate where the blank is played,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
but your function that returns best_played doesn't necessarily have to return

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
a representation like that. It could have returned a blank character there or something.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
As long as we know that the score is correct and the best play is correct.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
When there are two blanks, we could have continues to create BANKBENCH

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
with two blanks in it, but it turns out that another play--

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
making KiCk and taking advantage of some triple bonuses scores higher.
