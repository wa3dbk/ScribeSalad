00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All right--so why is that--so it turns out that this little plastic ring thing, you can think of it as a graph

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
where each of the little plastic connectors is actually an edge between nodes

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and the place that they intersect is a node.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We've got a node here and a node here--they're connected.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Node here and node here--they're connected, connected. This is a node and they're connected.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Mark all the intersection points as nodes and put all the pieces of plastic in that connect them as edges.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You can now just focus on that graph. So here's our graph.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It has a total of 26 nodes and 39 edges and what we're looking for in this graph--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we're going cut edges, we're going to remove edges to make a tree.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Right--the tree is going to be connected and have no turtle catchers

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which we in graph theory call cycles.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
How many edges are in a tree where 26 nodes, 25. How many do we have--39.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Well, we're going to have to kill 14 edges to turn this into a tree.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I first discovered this trick quite by accident that I actually was cutting up the little ring things

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that saved the turtles and a surprise, that no matter how I did, I always seem to

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to come out with the same number and then I realize it was just a graph theory problem.
