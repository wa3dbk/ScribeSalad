00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.610
So here are the expressions we get when we combine our functions, f of x and g

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:11.055
of x, in these different ways. G minus f of x, gives us x squared minus 2x. F

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:16.713
plus g of x, gives us x squared. Fg of x, which remember, is the same thing as

00:00:16.713 --> 00:00:23.588
f times g of x, gives us, x cubed, minus x squared. And, last but not least, g,

00:00:23.588 --> 00:00:26.933
over f of x, gives x minus 1.
