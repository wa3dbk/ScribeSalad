00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.470
Here's the third constraint, having to do with the displaying of the document.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.060
In this case it's an invariant, it's an indirect, indirect guarantee.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:17.380
And it's relating the contents that are visible in the viewport to the data

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.310
that's provided by the file manager, as far as it's document is concerned.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.770
And it's saying in, in, in effect that the sequence of lines

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.880
that we see are determined by the handle position of the scroll, scrollbar,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.920
that is the top line we see is determined by the handle position of

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.390
the scrollbar, and we're going to see subsequent lines that and

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.160
the number of them is the, is the height minus 1.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.180
That is the number of additional lines plus the top line, that gives us height,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.680
which is what we would expect.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.670
What this says is that what we will see in the view contents percept is that

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.520
subsequence of lines that the document, from the document starting with

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.110
the line indicated by the scrollbar's handle position and continuing for

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.050
height minus one additional lines.
