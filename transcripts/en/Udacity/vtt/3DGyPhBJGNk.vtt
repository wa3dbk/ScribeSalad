00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.790
We'll be experimenting with D3 on the Udacity course page for this class.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.570
Since D3 is a client side JavaScript library you can load it onto any web

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.150
page that you're on and start playing around with the elements of HTML or

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.230
SVG contained on that page.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.240
If you're on any of the web pages of the data visualization class.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.010
D3 should already be loaded.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.080
But if you're on a web page that does not have D3 loaded,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.870
you can simply copy the D3 source and paste it in the web console.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.110
I will be using the Google Chrome browser throughout this course.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.680
But, any modern browser should have all of the same functionality of

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.980
a JavaScript console and an HTML inspector.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.660
To open the JavaScript console, we can go to the Tool bar of Chrome accessed

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.410
from the upper right corner of the browser window, scroll down to the sub menu

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.000
of Tools, and from Tools you can see here that we can view source,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.320
access the Developer Tools or go into the JavaScript Console.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.440
As you notice here it pops up a window on the bottom of

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.780
my browser that let's me enter and execute JavaScript.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.760
Unfortunately at Zipfian Academy we do not have the engineers or

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.000
great production team that Udacity has to create such

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.330
a compelling online education platform.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.160
What we do have, however, is a knowledge of D3 and JavaScript.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.450
So instead of building our own platform, let's usurp Udacity and

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.340
pretend that we have their own platform as well.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.600
We can do this by changing the branding of Udacity's logo,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.990
maybe some elements with the course, and

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.490
actually change anything else on the webpage that we may want to.
