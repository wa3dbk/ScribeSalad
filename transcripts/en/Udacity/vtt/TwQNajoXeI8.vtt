00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right, so I've got an interesting collection of names here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I had to include Michael because it is a relevant name to me,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but in fact, in 1995, it was the most popular name given in the US,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
more popular than any of the names given to any of the women and in fact,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Matthew is the second highest male name,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but I didn't ask for male names, I asked for female names.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The most popular female name given was Jessica,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I think that was actually most popular for a good solid decade or two.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That's been very popular for a very long time

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
as had Michael been in decades and decades and decades.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This is no longer the most popular given name, but it was for a long time.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The second most popular female name is Ashley.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Well, Zuzana was among the least popular, and Taylor was pretty popular

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and pretty distinctive to that year but not the second most popular in that year.
