00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.700
There's one last optimization that I want to mention, and

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.420
this is a hardware one. One might expect that the CPU

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.700
had to execute all of the store instructions, needed to move

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.830
data along the bus from memory to disk, and vice versa.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.300
This would work, but it would be very slow. Instead, streaming

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.690
devices, like a disk, have their own controller that is capable

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.180
of sending along the bus itself. Through the bus, the CPU

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.390
tells it the length of the chunk it's supposed to copy,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.910
the device address on the disk, the memory address, the

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.730
command, whether it's a read or a write, and then

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.530
tells it to go. The CPU then goes on about

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.200
its business while the device controller uses the memory bus

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.780
to either read or write the data. Now the CPU

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.050
and the device controller are in competition for the use

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.830
of the bus here. But because the CPU is going

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.390
to find most of its data in the cache, it's not

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.980
using the memory bus all that often, leaving it

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.120
for the device controller. This phenomenon is sometimes called

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.720
cycle stealing as the device controller is able to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.790
steal cycles on the memory bus away from the CPU.
