00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.570
For this one, x would equal positive 21. Nice work if you got this one correct.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.460
Remember we always want to isolate the radical on one side of the equal sign.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.538
So we'll need to add 3 to both sides here in order to get the square root

00:00:12.538 --> 00:00:17.542
alone. So, with our square root on the left and positive 8 on the right, we're

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:23.522
ready to square both sides to undo this square root. Squaring this side gives

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:28.985
us 3x plus 1 and squaring this side gives us positive 64. Next we just solve

00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:33.572
for x. We subtract 1 from both sides and then divide the equation by 3. So 1x

00:00:33.572 --> 00:00:40.090
equals 21. We check our answer by plugging 21 into the original equation for X.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.430
When we check, we get the true statement 5 equals 5. So here is our solution.
