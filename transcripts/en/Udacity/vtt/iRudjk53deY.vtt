00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.758
You saw that we denoted this corrected standard deviation by lower case s. When

00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:11.006
we have a sample, this is what we use to approximate the true population

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:18.360
standard deviation sigma. We call this the sample standard deviation. But don't

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.157
get confused with the actual standard deviation of a small data set. For

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:29.234
example, let's say we have this data set where n equals 5. To find the standard

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:34.662
deviation of this, we would find the mean, which is 3, take each squared

00:00:34.662 --> 00:00:43.575
deviation from the mean. Add up the square deviations, which if also called the

00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:50.287
sum of squares, and divide by 5 or n. That's the standard deviation of these

00:00:50.287 --> 00:00:56.006
five values. But if we're using this to approximate a larger population that

00:00:56.006 --> 00:01:03.196
this sample came from, then we would divide by n minus 1. So, then this would

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:08.060
be 4 in the denominator if we're trying to estimate the standard deviation of

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.001
the population. So, don't get confused between these two. But it is kind of

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:18.390
confusing because this, when we use this formula with n minus 1 in the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.318
denominator, it's called the sample standard deviation and it's denoted by

00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:29.715
lower case s. So, just remember if you're given a sample and you need to

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:34.070
estimate the population standard deviation, you use this formula with n minus 1

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.832
in the denominator. Making the whole standard deviation slightly bigger. That's

00:01:40.832 --> 00:01:46.075
a better estimate then of the true population standard deviation sigma. But if

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:50.284
you have a data set and you need to find the standard deviation of that data

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:56.724
set, not approximate a population standard deviation, then you divide by n.
