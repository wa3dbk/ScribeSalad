00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
So, is showing the NP completeness of a problem always so involved with playing around

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.900
with strange constructions such as weird networks?

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.340
Well, the answer is in a way yes.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.620
Showing NP completeness can often involve playing around a lot

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.020
and some gory details in the proofs.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.690
So, even today, there are still scientific papers being published that

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.930
basically just show the NP completeness of a certain problem or set of problems.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.310
So, it is not an easy task, but luckily,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.980
there is a whole arsenal of known NP complete problems

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.970
out there which I'm now going to show you.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.950
If you go on Wikipedia, for example,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.480
there is a whole list of NP complete problems

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.080
from graph theory,  network design, sets and partitions, and so on and so on.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.010
So, for most practical problems that you will encounter

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.410
either they have already been shown to be NP complete

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.980
or although likely be very similar to one or more of these problems

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.050
for which we already know that they are NP  complete.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.310
In this case, similarity is a good thing because similarity means that a reduction will,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.980
in most cases, be either much easier than what we have just seen with shortest tour or,

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.180
at least, if you then look at the NP completeness proofs for those problems,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.150
then I give you techniques and ideas for performing the reduction that you are looking for.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.500
The foundation for this library was laid by a computer scientist called Richard Karp who,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.250
in 1972, showed 21 different problems to be NP complete,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.510
and that was basically the starting point for this huge list of thousands of NP complete problems.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.010
Now, let's see if you already have an intuition which NP complete problems

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.460
would be most useful to show the NP completeness of other problems.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.380
So, let's say you encounter  a number of problems.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.110
One problem will deal with clustering or finding large groups of related objects

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.530
or you would encounter a problem that deals with covering a set of object as efficiently as possible.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.170
So, you have to select a few objects that is some way observed or--

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.480
no, covering is a good term other objects in the set

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.310
or you could encounter problem that in some way deals with optimizing pathways.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.240
So, getting from one point to another point

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.370
but there are few constraints up here that you have to meet.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.810
Here, you are trying to find clustered groups of related objects.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.440
Finally, you could deal with a problem that is about diversification.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.300
So, large groups of independent objects don't have anything to do with each other.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.250
And finally, something else.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.490
Now, you already know the five NP complete problems.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.730
You know the shortest tour, you know vertex cover, you know SAT,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.840
independent set, and clique.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.560
Now, what I would like to know from you is if you encounter a problem

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.730
that basically arises in one of these five situations here

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.920
which of these problems here for which we know that they are NP complete

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.670
would be your best bet for proving

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.650
a problem that falls into one of these categories here is NP complete.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.540
So, basically using this as a basis for a reduction.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.820
So, these are numbered and you can enter your numbers

00:02:58.820 --> 99:59:59.000
for the ones that you think match best in these circles here.
