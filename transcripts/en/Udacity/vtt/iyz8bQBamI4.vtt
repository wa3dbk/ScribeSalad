00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.020
Now let's look at some frequent problems that come up

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.370
when writing multi-threaded applications.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.710
First, make sure to keep track of the mutex and

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.930
condition variables that are specifically used with a given shared resource.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.520
What that means, for instance,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.260
is that when defining these variables make sure to write immediately a comment,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.150
which shared resource, which operation, which other piece of shared state,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.790
do you want this synchronization variable to be used with.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.860
For instance, you're creating a mutex m1 and

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.710
you want to use it to protect the state of a file, file 1.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.750
Next, make sure that if a variable or

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.130
a piece of code is protected with a mutex in one portion of your code,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.180
that you're always consistently protecting that same variable, or

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.530
that same type of operation with the same mutex everywhere else in your count.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.160
Basically, a common mistake is that sometimes we

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.300
simply forget to use the lock/unlock construct.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.580
And therefore, sometimes access the variable in a safe way.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.410
And if we don't use the lock and

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.980
unlock, then it won't be accessed in a safe way period.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.150
Some compilers will sometimes generate warnings or, or

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.250
even errors, to tell us that there is a potentially dangerous situation, where

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.720
shared variable is and isn't used with a mutex in different places in the code.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.750
Or, maybe they will generate a warning to tell us that there is

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.110
a lock construct that's not followed by the appropriate unlock construct.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.530
So certainly you can rely on compilers and tools to help avoid mistakes but

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.470
it's just easier not to make them in the first place.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.740
Another common mistakes that's just as bad as not locking a resource,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.670
is to use different mutexes for a single resource.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.580
So, some threads read the same file by locking mutex m1,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.940
and other threads write to the same file by locking mutex m2.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.320
At the same time, different threads can hold different mutexes and

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.890
they can perform concurrently operations on this file,

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.690
which is not what we want to be happening.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.630
So this scenario can lead to these undesirable situation, actually

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.980
dangerous situations where different types of accesses happen concurrently.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.740
Also it's important to make sure that when you're using a signal or

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.090
a broadcast you're actually signaling the correct condition.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.520
That's the only way that you can make sure that the correct set of

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.190
threads are potentially going to be notified.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.650
Again, using comments when you are declaring these conditions can be helpful.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.850
Also make sure that you're not using signal when you

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.140
actually need to use broadcast.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.390
Note that the opposite is actually safe.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.750
If you need to use signal but use broadcast, that's fine.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.190
You will still end up waking up one thread or more.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.500
And you will not affect the correctness of the program.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.870
You may just end up affecting its performance.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.630
But that's not as dangerous.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.080
Remember that with a signal only one thread will be woken up to proceed.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.950
And if, when the condition occurred we had

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.870
more than one thread waiting on the condition.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.220
The remaining threads will continue to wait.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.680
And in fact they may continue to wait possibly indefinitely.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.960
Using a signal instead of a broadcast can also possibly cause deadlocks.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.610
And we'll talk about that shortly.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.130
You also have to remember that the use of signal or broadcast or

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.680
rather, the order of signal or broadcast.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.390
Doesn't do anything about making any kind of

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.970
priority guarantees as far as which one of the threads will execute next.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.810
As we explained in the previous example,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.740
the execution of the threads is not directly controlled by

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.050
the order in which we issue signals to a condition variables.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.950
Two other common pitfalls spurious wake ups and dead locks,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.560
deserve special attention and we will discuss these two in more detail next.
