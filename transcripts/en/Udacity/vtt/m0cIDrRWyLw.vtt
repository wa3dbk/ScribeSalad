00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.490
This program is broken in to a series
of milestones, or a series of projects,

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.280
that are built to introduce you to
the major paradigms, major ideas,

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.020
in machine learning.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.545
We're going to start
with the big picture.

00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:12.010
We're going to start with some materials
that cover the entire landscape

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.558
of machine learning and
artificial intelligence.

00:00:14.558 --> 00:00:17.220
Then we'll get into model building and
validation.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.110
Machine learning is really about
building models that describe data and

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.860
then validating them
against some metrics or

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.990
comparing them against one another.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.850
Then we'll get into the nuts and
bolts of machine learning.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.990
We'll cover supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.480
reinforcement learning.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.090
These are different tools in your
toolbox that can be used to address

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.840
different kinds of problems.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.460
And that's important, because machine
learning isn't just about being able to

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.050
use a certain algorithm or
do a certain technique.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.470
It's about knowing when to do it and
how to evaluate the results.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.470
Those are the real learning goals
we want you to come away with this.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.778
We want you to know how to do certain
machine learning techniques, but

00:00:48.778 --> 00:00:51.392
we also really want you to
understand when to use them.

00:00:51.392 --> 00:00:53.600
And towards that end,
at the end of the nanodegree program,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.170
you're going to take
on your own project.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.670
You're going to take on your own
problem that you want to address

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.860
using some of the techniques
that you've learned.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.250
You're going to decide what is
appropriate for this kind of problem?

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.990
What is appropriate for this question?

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.295
What techniques should I apply?

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:08.370
And how do I evaluate the results
that I get out of it?

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.321
Because you're choosing that project
yourself as well, you'll come

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:14.518
away from this nanodegree program with
something that no one else can claim,

00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:16.337
a contribution that no
one has made before,

00:01:16.337 --> 00:01:18.620
a real testament to your
mastery of machine learning.
