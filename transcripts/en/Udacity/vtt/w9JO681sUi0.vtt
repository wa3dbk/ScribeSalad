00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.481
We'll use this knowledge of downstream and upstream to help us solve a motion

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:08.182
problem with the current. We know that if we travel downstream we'll end up be

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:12.920
travelling faster since we'll be going with the current. But if we travel

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.876
upstream we'll have to be going slower since we're going against it. Let's see

00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:20.880
if we can solve this first motion problem together. You take a boat upstream

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.334
for ten miles, and then back down for 15 miles. If the speed of the current in

00:00:25.334 --> 00:00:28.394
the river is five miles per hour, and you make the entire trip in one hour,

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:33.503
let's see if you can find the speed of the boat in still water. Just like all

00:00:33.503 --> 00:00:36.736
the motion problems we've encountered up until this point, we want to use a

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:41.609
table to help us organize all this information. So here's my table and we'll

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.263
have the distance for the boat upstream, its rate and its time, and the

00:00:45.263 --> 00:00:49.358
distance of the boat downstream with that rate and that corresponding time as

00:00:49.358 --> 00:00:55.924
well. We want to find the speed of the boat in still water. So, let's make that

00:00:55.924 --> 00:01:00.290
be our variable. X is going to be the speed of our boat and in miles per hour.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.134
So now that we have a variable what expression can you write for the rate, or

00:01:04.134 --> 00:01:07.792
the speed of the boat, moving upstream, and the speed of the boat moving

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:10.335
downstream.
