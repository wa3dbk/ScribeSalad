00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.850
You should recall that Marla has
had diabetes for 15 years and

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.290
is now showing early signs of lung
disease because of her smoking.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.030
Today she's visiting Doctor Johnson

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.760
the endocrinologist who
manages her diabetes.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.530
Doctor Johnson examines her and

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.380
checks her hemoglobin A1c level and
her blood sugar.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.050
He reports that her diabetes
is well controlled.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.270
So I'm always happy about that.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.210
But, when listening to her lungs,
he's concerned and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.870
tells Marla he wants to send her to
a pulmonary specialist, Doctor Jones,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.970
for a more careful evaluation.
