00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.390
Now, let's imagine that this program needed an object that

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.640
bears a resemblance to this gold one that we already made.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.420
To achieve this, perhaps we could start by building a new object and

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.100
giving it all the same values stored at all the same keys.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.490
We'll make a new object called blue and we'll start making it

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.840
look exactly like the gold object by copying the properties over one at a time.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.460
Incidentally, there are helper functions out there that can help you copy all of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.730
the properties from one object onto another.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.200
It doesn't come with the language, but

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.299
you could imagine doing the exact same thing with a simple foreloop.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.170
This arrow represents the process of copying over each of

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.190
the properties from the gold object to the blue object.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.270
Now, although the effect of this copy operation on

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.040
the blue object will last indefinitely.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.880
It's important to remember that the copying happens just at

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.560
one moment during the program's execution.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.230
It is not an ongoing copying back and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.550
forth behavior that keeps the two objects in sync.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.010
In this case, there's only one property in our gold object, so

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.050
the copying process is quite simple.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.280
The copying process is now complete and won't be repeated.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.790
So if our program later goes on to modify gold or blue, we'd probably only

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.870
expect them to have the a property in common after those modifications.
