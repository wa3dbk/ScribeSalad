00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this homework we're going to show the power of functions as tools by computing

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
inverse functions and doing the work just once, rather than having to do it for each function.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What do I mean by that? The square function for squaring numbers is easy, right?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We just return x times x.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But if we wanted to define the square root function, that's a lot harder.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Assuming we didn't have the exponentiation operator built in,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
if we wanted to define it in terms of elementary arithmetic, that's a lot of work.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Isaac Newton came up with a way to do it, but he's Newton.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
For those of us who aren't, wouldn't it be great if instead of having to write all this code

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to define the square root, we could just say "sqrt" is the inverse of square and be done with it?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Well, in this homework we're going to do just that.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We're going to do it in a slightly restricted sense.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We're only going to deal with functions that are defined on the non-negative numbers

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and are monotonically increasing. They have to keep on going up.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That way they have a defined inverse.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Functions that are non monotonic don't have a single inverse,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
because there's a two-to-one mapping.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Here's my definition of inverse.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm going to give you a simple version and then ask you to write a more efficient one.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
What does inverse do? It takes a function f and returns a function f_1.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The way it figures out what to do is it says let's start at zero,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
because we said this is the function defined on the non-negative numbers,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and ask is this f(x) greater than the y that's being passed to f_1.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If it is, let's increment x by a little bit--a little bit being delta,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
which here I've defined as 1/128, but you can define it as what you want

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
when you're asking for the inverse.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Keep on going until we find an f(x) which is not less than y.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Now x is too big. It's greater than or equal to y, and y minus delta is too small.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It's less than y. We're somewhere in between the two, and we want to pick the closest one.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
That's what this expression does.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It says we know the result is somewhere in there, and we want to choose which one is closer.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
How does that work? Well, we can define square. We can ask for the square root of 100.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I guess I missed a step in here where I have to say that sqrt is equal to inverse(square).

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now when we ask for the square root of 100

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
we get exactly 10.0. That's the right answer.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
When we ask for the square root of 99, we get 9.95-something.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
That's pretty close, although there are more accurate representations

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that the computer could come up with.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
When we ask for the square root of 100 million, we get 10,000 exactly,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
which is exactly the right answer.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
But it took a little bit too long. It took almost a second to come up with this result.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'd like it to go much faster.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So that's what I'm going to ask you to do.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I want you to modify inverse so that it has a run time closer to the logarithm of the input to f_1

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
rather than to linear in the input to f_1.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I'll give you two hints of things to consider.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
One is binary search, and the other Newton's method.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So do some research on those, and then modify the definition of inverse

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
so that when we say sqrt = inverse(square) the whole function runs faster.
