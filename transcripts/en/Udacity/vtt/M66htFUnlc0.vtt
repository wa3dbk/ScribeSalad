So the essence of Chomsky's view on language, is that the human mind learns

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:09.680
language naturally and easily. In fact, actually, learning is not even the best

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.936
word. We discover language, much the same way we discover walking. It just

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:18.206
happens to us. In fact, think about how easy it was for you learning your first

00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:23.282
native language. You didn't really learn it, it just happened. So, it's not at

00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:28.841
all like math or reading or history, you just do it. This is Chomsky's view on

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:30.455
language acquisition.
