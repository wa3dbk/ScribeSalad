00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.986
We're not controlling for differences in memory capabilities due to gender in

00:00:04.998 --> 00:00:09.717
this particular test. To do this, we could divide the group into males and

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:14.565
females, and then see how sleep influences memory in both groups. We want the

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:20.052
amount of sleep to vary amongst individuals, so that we can see how their memory

00:00:20.064 --> 00:00:25.433
is related to that. We are controlling for variation in people's individual

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:30.735
memory capabilities,, because by using this same person twice, we're doing

00:00:30.747 --> 00:00:36.324
what's called a within-subject design. That way we can see how sleep influences

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:41.780
memory for this same person. And by using this same person twice, we're keeping

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:46.795
a lot of other things constant, including this variation in people's individual

00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:51.555
memory capabilities. We're also not controlling for the time of day in this

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:56.440
study, but this would be a good thing to add on to the within-subject study. We

00:00:56.452 --> 00:01:01.205
could tell our subjects to sleep a lot, then take the memory test at the same

00:01:01.217 --> 00:01:06.292
time the next day as everyone else, like 3 o'clock. Then again, we can tell

00:01:06.304 --> 00:01:11.530
people to sleep a little, and then take the memory test at the same time of day,

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:12.871
again at 3 o'clock.
