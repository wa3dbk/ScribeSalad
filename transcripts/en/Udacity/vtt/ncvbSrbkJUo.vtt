00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.434
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So here we have two numbers that multiply together, to equal a positive

00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:07.276
number, but add together to equal a negative number. So, in the general case,

00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:10.934
not just this specific one we're looking at, if we have any two numbers that

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:14.710
multiply to equal a positive number, but that add to equal a negative number,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.612
what can we say about those two numbers? Are they both positive, are they both

00:00:18.612 --> 00:00:22.832
negative, is one positive and the other negative? Is one zero, or are both of

00:00:22.832 --> 00:00:26.178
them zero? Pick which of them you think is the best choice.
