00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.609
Here's my answer.

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.460
The first thing I did,
was to fill in the diagonals.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.310
These should all be 0 unless
there's a negative cycle.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.490
Thankfully, there's only one
negative path found so far, and

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.550
I can easily check that it
doesn't create a negative cycle.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.260
When we use 4 as an intermediate vertex,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.080
I could go from 3 to 4,
that would cost -3.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.007
But going back from 4 to 3 would cost 6,
and so

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:29.030
then the overall cost would
be 3 which is greater than 0.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.350
0 is better.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.418
Next, I filled in the values where 4
was either a source or a destination,

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:41.580
since vertex 4 can't help as an
intermediate vertex in those situations.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.670
Now for the remaining entries.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.481
The choices for going from 1 to 3
are either to use the old path,

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.347
which costs 4, or to go from 1 to 4.

00:00:51.347 --> 00:00:54.990
And then from 4 to 3, that costs 7.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.410
So, the old path is better.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.360
How about going 2 to 1?

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.860
Well, there is no old path.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.470
But there is a path through 4.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.790
I could go from 2 to 4,
that would cost 1.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.540
And then from 4 to 1, which would
cost 2 more, for a total of 3.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.140
That's good.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.921
Going from 2 to 3 was impossible before,
but

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:23.955
using vertex 4,
I can go 2 to 4 for a cost of 1.

00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:28.600
And then 4 to 2 for
a cost of 6 more for a total of 7.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.460
3 to 1 is another path that's
impossible without going through 4.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.623
But if I do go through 4,
then going 3 to 4 costs -3.

00:01:37.623 --> 00:01:41.750
And going 4 to 1 costs 2,
for a total of -1.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.574
Lastly, we have that going from
3 to 2 used to cost 2, but

00:01:46.574 --> 00:01:51.794
we can improve on that,
by going to 4 first, which costs -3.

00:01:51.794 --> 00:01:56.856
And then going form 4 to 2,
which costs 1, for a total of -2.

00:01:56.856 --> 00:01:58.300
And that completes the answer.
