Great work. Thumbs up. The data has landed safely on

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.065
our phones. But I was thinking about it, and actually

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:10.057
instead of hard coding our post code in, we'd really

00:00:10.057 --> 00:00:12.515
[SOUND] like our sun train app user, to be able

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:15.726
to change their location in the settings. So let's make

00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:19.183
the FetchWeatherTask more flexible by having it take as input

00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:22.890
a postal code parameter. While we're doing that, we should

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.340
also take this opportunity to do a little bit of refactoring.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.600
Instead of concatenating the strings for the server query

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.369
URL, we should use a UriBuilder Class to build

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.580
up he URL. We can declare a base URL

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.120
and then append each pair of query PARAM and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.100
PARAM values onto it. This includes PARAM's for post

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.890
code. JSON format, metric units, and date count. This'll

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.080
make it easier in the future if we ever

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.610
have to make these options configurable by the user.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.950
If you want to verify that the URL is built up properly. After

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.110
you do these tasks, you can use verbose logging to print it out.
