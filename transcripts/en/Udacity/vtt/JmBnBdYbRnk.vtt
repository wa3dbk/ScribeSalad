00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.800
This probably seems like
a whole lot of magic.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.980
How did Gradle know where
to find your sources?

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.610
And how did Gradle know what
compiler options to use?

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.610
Or what directory to
put your build outputs?

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.790
Gradle uses the philosophy of
convention over configuration, or

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.080
as I prefer to think about it, Gradle
has sensible, opinionated defaults.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.200
You can lay out a Java project
however you please, but by default,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.940
Gradle will assume your
sources in source, main, java.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.660
And your test in source, test, java.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.140
And your outputs in the build directory.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.300
Gradle is married to that idea however,
and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.080
you can easily tell gradle that
your sources live somewhere else.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.580
There is a big upside to falling
into gradle defaults though.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.280
It means you can pick up any
other Gradle Java project and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.580
be pretty confident that you already
know how the project is laid out.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.120
It also means that if the project
deviates from the defaults,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.940
that configuration is
obvious in the build script.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.470
Gradle also does its best to
separate capabilities from opinions.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.290
The Java plugin actually first
applies the Java base plugin.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.930
The Java base plugin is what provides
the ability to compile Java, and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.300
adds the concept of source
sets to the project.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.130
However it doesn't add any
source sets in particular.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.720
The opinionated conventions
are applied by the Java plugin.
