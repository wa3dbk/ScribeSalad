00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.730
Now I will argue that these
enhanced Multitape Turing machines

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.820
have the same computational power
as regular Turing machines.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.320
Multitape machines certainly
don't have less power.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.510
By ignoring all but the input tape,
we obtain a regular Turing machine.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.680
Let's see why Multitape Turing
machines don't have any more power

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.480
than regular machines.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.760
On the left, we have a Multitape Turing
machine in some configuration.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.000
And on the right, we have created
a corresponding configuration for

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.810
a single tape Turing machine.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.720
On the single tape, we have
the contents of the multiple tapes

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.060
with each tape's contents
separated by a hash.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.820
So here's the first tape, here's
the second tape, here's the third tape.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.790
Also note these dots here.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.150
We're using a trick that
we haven't used before,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.640
expanding the size of the alphabet.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.790
For every symbol in the tape
alphabet of the multitape machine,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.370
we have two symbols on
the single tape machine.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.800
One with a dot, and one without.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.650
We use the mark symbols to indicate
that the head of the multitape machine

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.910
would be over this position on the tape.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.530
So the 1 is marked here, the 1 is
marked here, and the 0 is marked here.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.530
Simulating a step of the multitape
machine with the single tape version

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.840
happens in two phases, one for
reading and one for writing.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.390
First, the single tape machine simulates

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.960
the simultaneous reading of
the heads of the multitape machine.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.510
By scanning over the input and
noting which symbols have marks on them.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.090
So here it would first note that one
is under the head of the first tape,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.980
then that another one is under
the head of the second tape.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.540
And then that a 0 is under
the head of the third tape.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.870
That completes the first phase
where we read the symbols.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.310
Now I need to update
the tape contents and

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.560
the head positions or
markers as part of the writing phase.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.740
Let's say that the multitape
machine changes this 0 to a 1 and

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.930
moves the head to the left, like so.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.410
Then on the single tape machine,
we need to change this 0 dot to a 1 and

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.920
change this 0 to a 0 dot.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.870
Note that it's possible that one of
these strings will need to increase its

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.060
length when the multitape writes to
a position it hasn't reached before.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.600
In that case, we just right shift
the tape contents to allow room for

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.530
the new symbol to be written.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.020
Once all that work is done,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.180
we return the head back to the beginning
to prepare for the next path, like so.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.230
And notice that I updated
the tape contents appropriately.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.570
So all the information about
the configuration of a multitape machine

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.010
can be captured in a single tape.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.480
And it's not too hard to convince
yourself that all the logic needed

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.240
to read from multiple places and
remember all that contents.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.830
In order to figure out
the right writing response,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.200
can also be implemented with
a state transition logic.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.760
It's a good exercise to work that
out if it's not obvious to you.
