00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.630
&gt;From the high level description of what happens on page faults and how it is

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.140
handled, you can see that the behavior of

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.090
this GMS global memory management, is as follows.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.570
So overtime, you can see that if there is an idle node in the land, then

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.460
that idle node, its working set is continuously

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.810
going to decrease as it accommodates more and

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.290
more of its peers pages that are swapped out to fit in its global cache. And

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.430
eventually a completely idle node, becomes a memory

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.600
server, for peers on the network. So that's the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.890
expected behavior of this logarithm. And the key

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.700
attribute of the logarithm is the fact, that

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.800
the split between Local and Global is not

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.980
static, but is dynamic, depending on what is happening

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.350
at a particular node. For instance, even the

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.400
same node, if it was serving as a memory

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.340
server for my peers, because I had gone

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.330
out to lunch, I come back, and start actively

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.760
using my workstation. In that case, I'm going to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.270
go back, and the community service part of my

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.145
machine is going to start decreasing. So the Local

00:01:12.145 --> 00:01:15.990
Global split is not static, but it shifts depending

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.640
on what local memory pressure exist at that node.
