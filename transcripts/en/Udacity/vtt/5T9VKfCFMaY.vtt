00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.870
As you may have noticed from the graph, this graph is symmetric about the

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.238
y-axis, and is therefore an even function. As a review, if the function was

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:15.300
symmetric about the origin, it would be an odd function. An example of an odd

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.712
function would be f of x equals x cubed. Here is what the graph looks like.

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:23.844
This graph is symmetric about the origin.
