00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.180
Handling your own orthographic
camera is often necessary, but

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.683
there's quite a lot of fuss involved
with getting the aspect ratio right and

00:00:07.683 --> 00:00:10.010
in positioning your world on the screen.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.210
If you don't need to move your
camera around in your game world,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.595
it's often easier to use
a viewport to manage your camera.

00:00:16.595 --> 00:00:19.975
We've set up a little demo project
to show off the various viewports.

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:23.585
What we're doing is, we're drawing a
little checkerboard that's 16 units wide

00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:28.505
by 9 units tall, which is intentionally
not the same size as the window we're

00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:30.610
going to use to display this world.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.970
So here in create we've made
an orthographic camera, and

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.202
the first viewport we're going to
explore is the ScreenViewport.

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:40.330
The ScreenViewport doesn't care
about the size of the world.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.770
It just sets the camera up for
pixel for pixel drawing.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.010
This is great if you need
that in particular, but

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.860
it's not super useful for most games.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.710
Let's check out what it does.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.300
So our checkerboard is down here on the
bottom left and it's 9 pixels tall and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.770
16 pixels wide, and
you can hardly see it all.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.540
Let's try another viewport that
might be better for this task.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.734
Here we've switched over
to a stretch viewport.

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:06.930
StretchViewport makes the world
exactly fit the screen, but

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.470
it doesn't respect the aspect
ratio of the world, so

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.290
things might look stretched,
either horizontally or vertically.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.170
Since our world is 16 units wide by 9
units tall, and the aspect ratio of this

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.460
is squarer than that, that means our
world gets stretched vertically or

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.490
squashed horizontally,
depends how you want to think about it.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.000
Now we've switched
over to a FillViewport.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.510
FillViewport does respect
the aspect ratio of the world, but

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.640
it might clip some parts of the world
in order to make that true.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.960
For instance, this world is now
only 12 by 9, instead of 16 by 9.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.450
The extra is offscreen to the left and
right.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.170
A FitViewport makes sure that
the entire world is visible and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.260
at the correct aspect ratio.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.800
However, it does this by adding black
bars at the top and bottom or left and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.310
right to pad out the rest of the window.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.960
This is also called Letter Boxing.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.040
It's what happens when you watch
wide screen movies on old TVs.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.110
This is a great choice when the exact
size of the game world is essential,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.880
but it can look bad on devices that
have very different aspect ratios from

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.160
what you intend.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.272
The last viewport type
is the ExtendViewport.

00:02:12.272 --> 00:02:15.645
The ExtendViewport also ensures that
the entire game world is visible and

00:02:15.645 --> 00:02:17.390
at the correct aspect ratio.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.650
It just makes the game world
bigger in the smaller dimension

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.240
in order to fill up
the rest of the space.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.150
So if you remember from
the ScreenViewport,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.660
we had this green apron all around.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.450
You can see it in this version because
we're actually allowed to draw up here.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.180
Back when we were using the FitViewport,
those black bars,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.950
we weren't allowed to draw
anything out there at all.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.180
When it comes to making games that
work across a whole range of devices

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.475
with different aspect ratios,

00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:45.918
ExtendViewport is almost always the best
choice, when you can get away with it.

00:02:45.918 --> 00:02:48.740
Remember, the ScreenViewport
makes the size of the world

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.850
match the size of the screen,
pixel for pixel.

00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:55.470
StretchViewport makes the world fill
the screen, regardless of aspect ratio.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.060
FillViewport also makes
the world fill the screen,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.285
maintaining the aspect ratio but
cutting off bits of the world.

00:03:03.285 --> 00:03:06.070
FitViewport fits the world
inside the screen,

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.558
adding black bars to pad out the extra
space to maintain the aspect ratio.

00:03:10.558 --> 00:03:14.470
And finally, ExtendViewport makes the
short axis of the world larger to fill

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.360
the screen,
maintaining the aspect ratio.
