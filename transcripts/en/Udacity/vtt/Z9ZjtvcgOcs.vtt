00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.340
Now, we're going to talk about
a very different kind of an attack.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.550
This is called inference attacks and
that can be performed or

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.810
mounted against databases.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.340
So the definition of an inference attack
is actually fairly straight-forward.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.420
Inference attacks occur when
somebody's able to use queries

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.040
that they're authorized for, they're
allowed to execute those queries.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.020
But by executing those queries, they're
able to gain access to information for

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.190
which they're not authorized.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.150
They're not allowed to access
that information directly.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.220
So the way they gain access
to that information is by

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.180
executing a set of queries that are
authorized, and then making an inference

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.690
based on the results that
are returned by those queries.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.250
So a concrete example here, since
we're talking to students in a course,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.850
is let's say a database that
contains all your grades.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.405
So schema, maybe we have an attribute,
that is the studentid,

00:00:55.405 --> 00:01:00.625
maybe the student_standing, whether
a junior or senior and then scores.

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.120
These might be numerical
values between zero and 100,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.030
let's say, on exam1, exam2 and
then the final_grade.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.860
The tuple, if you look at it, it's
going to have a studentid, either junior

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.520
or senior, their standing, the two
exams, course and the final_grade.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.150
So if we consider this database, where
we have a tuple for each student in

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.210
the class, tuple as we just discussed,
what kind of query can you allow on it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.360
which any user should be allowed to
submit and get the result from it?
