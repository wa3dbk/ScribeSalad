00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.710
let's take a couple of examples. So with speech you

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.200
might take 8000 samples per second, and you might have

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.850
8 bits per sample. So what is the sampling rate

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.200
in this case? Please give your answer in kilobits per second.
