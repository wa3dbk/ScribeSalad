00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is 1 + square root of 5 over 2,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
otherwise known as the Golden Ratio.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Golden Ratio I knew was actually the ratio of success of elements

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
of the Fibonacci sequence--the sequence 1,1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
converges to that ratio.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But I didn't know that the number of calls in the implementation also converges to that ratio.

00:00:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So that's something new.
