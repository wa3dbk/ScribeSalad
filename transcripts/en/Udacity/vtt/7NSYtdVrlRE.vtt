00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.000
Now one thing that looks a little
funny about this data is that every

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.660
value is a string.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.370
But days to cancel looks like
logically it could be an integer.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.530
Cancel date is clearly a date and

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.895
is cancelled looks like a boolean,
but they are representative strings.

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:19.585
That's because the CSV library doesn't
try to detect what type each column has.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.525
It's up to me to convert
these data types if I want.

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:25.857
I could wait and convert them
later when I really need to.

00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:29.367
For example, every time I need to
check weather is cancelled is true,

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:34.167
I could use the code, if is cancelled
is equal to the string true,

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:38.767
rather than the simpler if is canceled
that I could use if I had a boolean.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.407
However, I prefer to update
all my data types upfront

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:44.777
because otherwise I tend to forget that
they're not the type I expect, and

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.847
then I waste time debugging later.

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:50.000
I've written some code for you which
you can find in your starter notebook

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.400
which updates a bunch of the types.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.410
Here you can see the main

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.350
loop that's updating the types
of the enrollments data.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.870
I didn't update the type of account key,
because even though the account key

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.680
looked like an integer, I'm never
going to do arithmetic with it.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.790
I'm not going to add up
two account keys, for

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.390
example, so,
the types might as well remain a string.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.580
I did convert the cancel date to
a python date time object, and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.840
I wrote this function to do that for me.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.740
First I check whether the date
is actually the empty string,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.470
in which case I return None.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.070
For example,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.770
the cancel date could be an empty string
if the student hadn't cancelled yet.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.950
Otherwise, I use the strptime function
to parse the string as a date time.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.770
Don't worry if you've never
seen the strptime function.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.520
I'm going to take care of the date
time handling in this lesson.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.550
Similarly, for
the days to cancel function,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.330
I've written a function
called parse maybe int.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.610
This function takes something that
might be an integer but might not be.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.180
For days to cancel,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.590
it might not be an integer if
the student hasn't cancelled yet.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.750
If the argument is the empty string,
this function will return None and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.940
otherwise it will cast
the argument to an integer.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.970
Then, for the is_canceled column,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.048
I check if the value is
equal to the string true.

00:02:03.048 --> 00:02:05.690
So this comparison will
return the boolean true

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.720
if the field is equal to the string
true and false otherwise.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.060
The rest of the conversions are similar.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.090
The only other thing that's a bit
strange is in the daily engagement table

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.350
where you can see that a few times
I've cast the number to a float first

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.480
and then an int.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.020
To see why, I'm going to scroll up and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.200
see what the lesson's
completed value looked like.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.765
The first value for
lessons completed was zero point zero.

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:31.015
Because of the decimal point,

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:33.865
directly converting the string
to an integer would fail.

00:02:33.865 --> 00:02:37.515
But, logically, I know lessons completed
should be an integer since if you only

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:42.115
complete half a lesson, you'll be marked
as completing zero lessons, not 0.5.

00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:45.245
So, once I've converted the value
to a floating point number,

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:47.375
I then convert it to an integer.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:51.495
I've done the same thing for number of
courses visited and projects completed.

00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:54.200
This code is included in
the starter notebook.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.850
Once you have everything set up locally,

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.110
you should make sure you
run each of these cells.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.830
That way you'll have the correct types
throughout the rest of the lesson.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.510
In general, make sure you run all
the provided starter code, or

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.460
some later code may not work correctly.
