00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.920
To help you learn new material, we created a unique

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.720
concept map for each lesson. Here's an incomplete map for lesson

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.120
1 that you can also download from the instructor's notes.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.420
Print it out or just keep it handy, and see if

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.090
you can fill in the empty blanks. As you go

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.110
along. At the end of the lesson there will be an

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.280
opportunity for you to fill in the missing words to see

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.520
a complete version. If you prefer to have the complete version

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.930
as you go through the lesson just skip to the end of this lesson and

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.200
look in the instructor's notes for the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.120
complete concept map of Lesson One. I highly

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.750
encourage you to try using the incomplete

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.350
version now though. Filling in your own notes

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.360
as the lesson progresses and then checking out

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.640
the completed map at the end after finishing.
