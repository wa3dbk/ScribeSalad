00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.893
You know,

00:00:00.893 --> 00:00:04.589
there are other ways to predict
what your users will want to type.

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.689
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for instance, if you already
have your users relevant data,

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.240
why not just prefill the form for them?

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.609
It's easy enough.

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:16.580
&gt;&gt; Even if your users aren't logged in,
you can still help them out.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.209
For example, you could guess their
location using location services.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.360
Check the instructor notes for
more details.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.130
In the end, this is all in the pursuit
of the most important principles to take

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.630
out from this lesson.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.330
Speed equals conversions.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.580
&gt;&gt; This lesson got you thinking
about fast, efficient inputs, but

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.420
you are just getting started.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.456
In the next lesson, you'll dive
into other time-saving tricks,

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.239
like creating inputs that
support autofill and validation.

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.830
&gt;&gt; Awesome, see you there.
