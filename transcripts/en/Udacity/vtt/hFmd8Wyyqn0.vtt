00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.730
Well the answer is, we want to call this Car function in

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.520
the same context as the new Van instance that's been created right there.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.300
Since that's being stored in the parameter this, we can just pass this along and

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.420
run the Car function in the same context as the Van function is being called.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.260
We can get rid of this pretend line of code because it was only there

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.320
to remind us what was going to take place as a result of using the keyword new.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.540
This is exactly how we want to call the Car function from within the Van

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.330
function such that it operates on the right context.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.080
But people seem to find this line of code extremely confusing.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.560
So let's take a look at it for a moment.
