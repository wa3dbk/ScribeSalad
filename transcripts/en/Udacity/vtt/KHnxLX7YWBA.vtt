00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to call my procedure sublists.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We saw before when I drew it out that we wanted 2 arguments:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the big list of people that I'm going to invite to my party

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and the people that I've selected so far.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
As we make recursive calls to sublists,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the big list of people I've yet to invite will shrink,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and then selected so far--the people who have showed up to my party--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
may or may not grow. They may show up or not.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So this is a recursive procedure, and every recursive procedure needs a base case

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or a stopping condition.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If there's no one left to invite, then I'll just print out the people we've selected so far.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Remember when I drew the tree at the bottom there were 8 answers?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
When I get down to the end, I want to print out each of those 8 answers.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If the big list is not empty, then it has at least 1 element--

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the current element, I'll call it--and then here I've just put the rest of the list,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
which is everything after the current element.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
May be empty; may have more things.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In this recursive procedure, we're going to call ourselves 2 times.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
There's 1 case where the current person responds to our dinner invitation

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and ends up being one of the people we select,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and there's another case where they do not. And that's actually it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Here's a test program.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
My dinner guests are Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and I'm going to call sublists, and the big list of people is dinner guests,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and the people I've chosen so far is nothing.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Let's see if this works.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And in fact, we got just the answer we wanted.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
There's 1 world where everyone shows up,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
1 world where no one shows up, 3 worlds with just 1 person,

00:01:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and 3 worlds with 2 people each, for a total of 8.
