00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So now we're going to see a representation of Boolean formulas

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in Python that we're going to be using

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to then write a function is satisfied

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that checks whether a given Boolean formula

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and a given assignment of true false values

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to that Boolean formula or rather to the variables

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in that Boolean formula satisfies it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So first, we have a variable num&lt;u&gt;variables,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which is simply the number of variables that are in the Boolean formula,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the number of distinct variables that is.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The Boolean formula itself is represented

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
as a list of lists where each inner list is a clause.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
For example, this inner list is the clause X1 or X2 or not X3,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and you can see that the variables that are negated are negative.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This clause would be X2 or not X4.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And this clause is not X1 or X3 or X4.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And then of course each individual clause would be anded together.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Assignment is a list of true false assignments to the individual variables.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Note that assignment has one more element in it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
than the number of variables.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The first one is actually just a place holder.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It doesn't do anything.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We're only concerned with the second element through the end of the list.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now if we have these individual assignments to the variables

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and then we print is satisfied of these,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
we can see that it returns true.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is a satisfied Boolean formula

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
or rather this Boolean formula is satisfied by this assignment

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
where X1 is true, X2 is true, X3 is true, and X4 true.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And if you run C through this and check,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
you'll see that that is in fact the case.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Now if we change assignment to true, false, true, true,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
then we can see that this assignment does not satisfy

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
the Boolean formula and returns false.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So your job is to write the is satisfied function

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to fill in the body of the function so that it correctly

00:02:06.000 --> 99:59:59.000
interprets whether a Boolean formula is satisfied by a given assignment.
