00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.090
The true power of docker is the ability
to not only build images, but

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.710
share them with others.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.090
To do that we'll need to host our images
on a remote container image registry

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.050
such as the Docker Hub.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.120
Review the output of
the docker images command and

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.850
notice the name of our
monolith container.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.420
By default all doc images
go to the Docker Hub

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.260
which assume that you
own that repository.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.350
So what we're going to do is use our own
name space which is our Docker username.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.830
So what we'll have to do is add
our user name to our Docker image

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.350
using the Docker tag command command.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.290
&gt;From the help output,
you can see that we take an existing

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.540
image tag combination and
we add a user name and a repository.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.720
The repository would be important if we
were pushed into a different repository

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.650
other than the in the default
docker hub like GCR or QUAY.IO.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.610
But since we're not,
we'll just add a username.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.890
Let's add the username using
the docker tag command.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.730
Now if we use the Docker image command,
you can see we have our tag.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.110
&gt;From this output you can see that
the Kelsey Hightower Monolith image name

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.920
has the same image ID
as a monolith image.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.290
Now we are ready to push our current
tenor image to the docker hub.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.220
Used the Docker push command to push
our image up to the Docker hub.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.640
So that didn't work.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.470
That's because we need to log in
before we can push to the registry.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.580
We can use the docker
login command to do that.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.920
Now let's try to push
our Docker image again.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.330
It worked this time, and

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.980
now we have a hosted image
that we can share with others.
