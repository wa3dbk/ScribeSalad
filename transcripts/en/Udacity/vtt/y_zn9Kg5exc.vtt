00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.241
We know that in the last example we were working with, we didn't have a

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:07.822
horizontal asymptote. But do we have something else instead? Well, we're going

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:13.246
to check out a slightly simpler example right now to get some ideas about that.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:19.686
Let's consider f of x equals 2x squared plus 3x minus 7 Over X minus 2. What do

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:23.994
we get if we use long division to divide the numerator by the denominator?
