00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.954
So now you've experimented with the die applet. And you've seen how the sampling

00:00:04.954 --> 00:00:10.621
distribution changes when we have larger sample sizes. But try one more applet.

00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:16.254
This time we have an actual population distribution. Rather than just the values

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:22.252
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Like we did with the dice. So this time, you can start

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:27.522
with a parent population being normally distributed. Or you can start with a

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:33.485
uniform distribution for the population, or skewed, or custom. You can draw a

00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:42.110
bimodal distribution, and then you simulate taking for example, five values from

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:49.306
this population, finding the mean. And graphing it. So I clicked animated here,

00:00:49.306 --> 00:00:54.390
and it found five random values from this population, and then plotted the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.550
sample mean. Let's do that same thing 1,000 times. So here's the distribution of

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.110
sample means, and you can even calculate the standard deviation of this

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.681
distribution, because here we have the population parameters. So the standard

00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:19.381
deviation of this distribution should be 7.88, the population standard deviation

00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:27.486
divided by the square root of 5. Try it out, do you get 3.54? You probably get

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:32.296
something pretty close, and that might be because this standard deviation is

00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:37.224
treating this as a sample, so it's using Bessel's correction. That means that

00:01:37.224 --> 00:01:42.729
this standard deviation would be slightly bigger than if we were calculating it.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.754
Treating this as a population. But that's besides the point. Play around with

00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:51.826
this. This will really help you get to know sampling distributions. And we're

00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:56.040
going to use sampling distributions throughout the rest of the course. The

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.000
important thing to take away here is that you can have any population of any

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.476
shape. And then, if you plot the distribution of sample means, you'll get a

00:02:05.476 --> 00:02:11.103
normal distribution. And it will be more an more normal as n increases. Remember

00:02:11.103 --> 00:02:16.323
though if n is 1 then the distribution of means is just going to look like the

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:21.778
population distribution. We don't just need to use computer applet's to

00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:27.805
demonstrate the central limit theorem we can use real materials, too. Professors

00:02:27.805 --> 00:02:32.883
Laraway and Rogers prepared the following example for you. Check it out.
