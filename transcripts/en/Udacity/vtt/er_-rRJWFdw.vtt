00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.148
Both of the functions we have here output real numbers for y, for any number of

00:00:04.148 --> 00:00:09.861
x that we could plug in. So the domain of each is all real numbers. In other

00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:13.738
words, negative infinity to infinity. The ranges of both of the functions are

00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:18.295
the same as one another, as well. They are both 0 to infinity, not including

00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:23.505
either of those endpoints. Now we can see this happening on either graph, but

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:28.270
why is it happening? Here is an instance where our equations can lend a hand.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.750
No matter how small a number you plug in for x in our exponential growth

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.124
function, 2 to the x will never reach 0. The numbers will get closer and closer

00:00:37.124 --> 00:00:41.655
to 0, but they'll never actually equal it. For the exponential decay equation,

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:45.010
if we look way out to the right side of the graph as x approaches infinity, y

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.475
will approach but never touch 0, since the same thing will be happening with

00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:51.390
this equation.
