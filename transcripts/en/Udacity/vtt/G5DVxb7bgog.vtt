00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.265
And the answer is 12,960,000 because you have to compare every single pixel in

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:12.558
one image with every single pixel in the other. So it's 72 times 72 times 50

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:18.178
times 50. This is clearly insane, now we only have two objects and we're all

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:24.034
ready doing way, way too much work. So, instead of computing the intersection

00:00:24.034 --> 00:00:27.692
between every single pixel and every other pixel in the world, we'll use an

00:00:27.692 --> 00:00:33.548
approximation of our pixel shape, which simplifies our collision calculations.

00:00:33.548 --> 00:00:37.940
And we'll do this by representing each object as a box and this is called an

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.460
access aligned bounding box or AABB for short.
