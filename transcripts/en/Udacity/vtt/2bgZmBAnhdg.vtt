00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.260
So, more than half a century ago, Eugene Wigner wrote

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.110
about, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.029
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.440
&gt;&gt; And, and, indeed one man can sit in one's living room and

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.330
do Duncan experiments and, maybe you know what that word means? I don't.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.410
&gt;&gt; Duncan means thought.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.560
&gt;&gt; Okay, thought experiments.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.110
&gt;&gt; Thought experiments.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.175
&gt;&gt; You can do these thought experiments and come up with something like the

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:22.990
gene-, General Theory of Relativity. You discover

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.910
black holes and the curvature of space-time.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.080
And why is that so? Could it be that we only perceive what we

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.140
can describe, without mathematics. And vice versa?

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.470
Because mathematics is co-evolved with our brain.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.550
&gt;&gt; Look, Eugene Wigman made a big problem for every generation

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.270
that came after him. To answer that question, why mathematics works.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.440
Why does mathematics? And sometimes I think

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.960
to myself, what, how could it not work?

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.050
The world has some coherence to it.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.896
Things don't just randomly happen. How do you

00:00:57.896 --> 00:01:00.151
describe things that don't randomly happen? If

00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:03.310
they don't randomly happen, you have to have

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.522
some kind of quantitative framework for explaining what

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:10.989
happens. So I can't imagine, on the one

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:17.517
hand I can't imagine a world that didn't work according to some kind of laws

00:01:17.517 --> 00:01:22.530
and those laws being written mathematically. On the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.040
other hand, I also can't quite understand why

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.080
mathematics works. So Eugene asked a very difficult

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.510
question. And he didn't know the answer. And

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.300
I think I, I, I don't know the answer, either. But here's what I would say.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.120
Here's what I would say. Not, why does mathematics work, but why do we need

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.260
mathematics to explain physics, why is it

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.680
so hard to explain physics in the English language? And the reason

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.658
is, because, yeah, we may have evolved as a species

00:01:56.658 --> 00:02:02.280
on mathematical abilities, but we evolved them, in the context,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.930
of rather ordinary things. The ordinary things would be,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.030
how stones move when you throw them. When it comes

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.590
to waves, we have some perspective about what a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.930
wave is because we see water making waves and so

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.380
forth. We have a good concept of what a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.580
force is because if I give you a good shove,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.900
you'll say, oh, don't force me. We know what

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.358
force means. But every time we enter into a new

00:02:27.358 --> 00:02:35.700
range of parameters We make things smaller than anything that

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.050
we were, than we grew up with. Other words, we go to the quantum world. Or we go

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.950
to the world of very, very heavy things and dense things. In other worlds,

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.800
we go to the world of black holes. We suddenly find that the intuitions and

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.770
the concepts that we evolved with are not sufficient

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.360
to understand. An example, we use higher dimensional spaces all

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.950
the time. We think we sometimes think for example, that

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.299
the that space itself may be more than three dimensions.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.020
You evolve. You and I evolved in a world of three dimensions. We can't visualize

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.770
more dimensions. And we can't because our

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.620
it, it's not that we're not smart enough.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.220
It's that the neural architecture, the architecture

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.950
of the brain itself. Was purposefully built, well

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.610
it wasn't purposely built, but it evolved

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.950
in the world of three dimensions. The architecture

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.160
is appropriate for three dimensions and it's

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.510
not appropriate for four, five, six, seven

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.200
dimensions. If we think that we're interested

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.700
in a space with seven dimensions or whatever,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.960
how would we describe it if we can't visualize it. We describe it by pure

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:04.180
mathematics. We say a three dimensional world is described by a bunch of points

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.940
that are labeled by X, Y, and Z

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.471
that's an abstraction. I can visualize three-dimensions on

00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:17.800
my head, but I use x, y, an z to describe them mathematically. Now I go

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.810
to four dimensions, or five dimensions. I can't

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.250
visualize it anymore. I can't visualize it anymore.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.290
I can't close my eyes an see a, a five-dimensional world. But I can add two

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.160
more letters to the alphabet. I can add the x, y, and z, w, and

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.760
v. And now I have a five dimensional space. How do I work with it? I work with

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.030
it using algebra. I work with it using

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.370
using abstract mathematics. And I don't try to see

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.260
it in my head. In trying to explain

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.820
it to people who don't have the mathematical background,

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.789
we get stuck. I can't say, now close your eyes and view in your head five

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.002
dimensions, because I can't do it either. What I, all I can do is say, take

00:05:05.002 --> 00:05:09.940
x, y, and z and add v and w. Eventually if, eventually a

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.220
person with this kind of mathematical background begins

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.340
to develop mathematical intuitions for things.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.370
They don't need the same kind of visualization. So, we are stuck. We're stuck

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:34.870
needing mathematics because evolution didn't equip us to be able to

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.950
visualize quantum mechanics. It didn't visualize us to be able to, there

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:47.368
sorry, it didn't equip us to be able to visualize 11 dimensional space-time.

00:05:47.368 --> 00:05:51.530
And tha, that's the reason. Evolution did it to us.
