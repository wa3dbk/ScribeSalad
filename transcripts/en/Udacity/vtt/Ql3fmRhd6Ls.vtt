00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, after all that, I think you're finally ready--you're mature enough--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to learn the whole truth about how for statements actually work.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You've been using them all along, but you may not have known the inner details,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the gory truth, about what's inside the for statement.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, when I saw for x in items, print x,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you probably have a model that looks something like this:

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
assuming items is a list or a tuple or a string,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you think of this code probably as something like i equals 0

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
while i is less than the length of the items, x equals items at i,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and then print x.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That's a good model as long as items is one of these sequence types like lists.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But items can also be other things, as we've seen.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It can be a generator expression, for example.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Overall, Python calls the thing that can be iterated over in a for loop an iterable.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Strings and lists are examples of iterables, and so are generators.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What actually happens when we implement this piece of code,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
it's as if we had written this code.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
First we take the items and we make an iterator from them

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
by calling the built-in function "iter." I'm going to call that "it."

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Then we're going to have a while loop that goes forever.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Its loop control says while True

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we're going to assign x to be the next item off of the iterator,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
then do whatever was in the body of the for loop, in this case print x.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We're going to keep on doing this sequence as long as we can get an x value.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But when next stops then we'll have an exception, which is a stop iteration exception,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and we don't need to do anything more. We're done.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
That's what a for loop really means in Python.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We take the items, we create an iterator over them,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we call that iterator until we're done, and then we pass through to the next statement.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We're finally ready to define this c, this counting function.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What it does is it takes a sequence, it says this is the first time I've been called.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm going to initialize my starts to one.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Then I'm going to enter into a loop and this means that c is a generator function.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The generator function will be returned, and as part of the for protocol,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
we'll call that generator function each time we want the next item in the sequence

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and each time we do that, our count of items will be incremented.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
When we're done, when the for loop doesn't want any more, we'll stop incrementing.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We don't necessarily go through every item in the sequence.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We'll just have just the right number of counts for item.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
This will give us the right number of starts and the right number of items.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We can do that because we control the time of execution,

00:02:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
because this is a generator function and not a regular function.
