00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.620
As you go through this course, you might encounter commands that

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.080
you've never seen before. And we don't expect you to know everything,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.970
but we do want you to keep the following in mind

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.910
when you encounter any sort of challenges or difficulties. First, take an

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.800
active role in problem solving and be aware of the resources

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.600
at your disposal. You can type a question mark and the name

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.690
of any function to bring up help documentation in R. So

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.590
for example I can look up the documentation for the function mean.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.590
Here it will tell me any parameters that mean takes. And

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.549
it will give me examples usually at the bottom of the documentation.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.330
I can copy and paste these into the console. And press

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.800
enter to see what the function does. Here, I created something called

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.470
x, and then if I hit x into the console, I

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.598
can see what this is. This is just the vector of numbers

00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:47.520
zero to ten, and then the number 50. I can take

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.600
the mean of x, and print it out. And finally, I have

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.870
some sort of trim parameter. Maybe you can figure

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.260
out what this does. Now, if you can't solve your

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.940
problem using the documentation I would suggest Googling it.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.840
StackOverflow is also another great site to browser for help.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.260
I've linked to some of the most useful websites

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.550
in the instructor notes, and you can also find these

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.970
in the course materials under Our Resources. One of my

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.110
personal favorites when I learned R was Quick-R, or statmethods.net.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.550
This site has excellent examples and short pieces of code that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.510
can refresh your memory and get you going on any data analysis.
