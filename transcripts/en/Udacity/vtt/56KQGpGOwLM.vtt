00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Dave:] I'm here with Dave Herman who works at Mozilla and directs research here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Tell us how you go involved in Mozilla and open-source projects.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
[David Herman:] I was actually a graduate at the time that I first got involved.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I was interested in JavaScript, and I was doing research in programming languages.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I was spending some time learning about JavaScript, and I wrote web pages about.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Out of the blue, Brendan Ike, the CTO at Mozilla and inventor of JavaScript,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
found the web pages that I had written and sent me an email and said

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that he was interested in talking to me about some of the things that I

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
had learned and was doing.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That experience alone was incredibly eye-opening to me.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It showed me that the assumptions that I had had about the boundaries

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
between research and industry, the boundaries between academia and industry.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The boundaries between just a person on the internet and the movers and shakers in industry

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
were a lot more porous than I realized, and it showed that the web is this place

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that brings people together who might otherwise not have had any way of getting to know each other.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That was very exciting, and I started talking with Brendan and talking with Mozilla

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and got involved with the ECMAScript Standards committee,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
which is the standards committee that standardizes the JavaScript programming language.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I was doing that while I was in grad school, and when I finished grad school

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I came to Mozilla full time.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
[Dave:] A lot of the students in our class have only been programming for about 7 weeks.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Can they still get involved in opensource projects or do they need a lot more experience than that?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
[Dave Herman:] There are all sorts of ways of getting involved in open source projects.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You don't have to be a computer science wizard to contribute.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
One of our largest sources of community volunteer work is localization,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
which is basically translation.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Firfox is developed in English and our official release is in English,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but we actually have close to 100 localized versions of Firefox in countries all over the world.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We have volunteers in communities that could be as large as many countries

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or could be as small as a small community in one country

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
where anybody can simply provide translations of the menu items

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and the windows and dialogue boxes--all of the stuff where we have to present

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
something to the user we do in English, and then you can translate it.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now you can have contributed to your native languages version of Firefox.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Another project that we started is a project called universal subtitles

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
where you can take YouTube videos that were recorded in one language,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and you can provide translation and the software will automatically create subtitles

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
based on the translation that you provided.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
There are all sorts of ways that people contribute to Mozilla software

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and to opensource software in general, and it doesn't always have to be technical.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It can be code, and sometimes we end up hiring people who started out contributing code

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and ended up working on some of the most advanced parts of our projects.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
But it also can be as simple as editing documentation or providing translations.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
[Dave:] We have a real wide range of different types of people in our class.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Can you tell us is it possible for anyone to get involved in opensource software?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
[Asa Dotzler:] One of the things that really appeals to me about opensource software

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
is the opportunity for a whole variety of people with backgrounds and different experiences

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and different interests to get involved with the project.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
A good example of this is if you look back to the Mozilla Project in 2002 and 2003,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
we were sort of struggling along with this next general Netscape communicator browser suite.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And one day a young 15-year-old high school student showed up in one of our IRC channels

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
where we all get together as engineers and testers and the people

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
working all across the project and talk about the work we're doing,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and he came in and said, "I don't like the way this particular button behaves in Mozilla."

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
"Can someone fix that?"

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I reached out to him, and I said, "That button is actually powered by some simple JavaScript."

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
"You could look at the source code and maybe you could fix it yourself."

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
He said, "Well, I've put together a couple of web pages. I know some simple JavaScript."

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And before you know it he was a dedicated member of the team.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Only a few short months later, he was one of the founding members

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
of the new Firefox project that would go on to reach 500 million users today.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
This is a 15-year-old high school student with no background in computer sciences.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
He got involved. He had mentors who helped him learn the pieces he didn't know.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
He went and read books, and before you knew it

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
he was building one of the world's most successful software products.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We also have a number of students who come here, either for weekend work

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
as something to compliment their education.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We have people who are in the industry and have been developing software

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
for as far back as the Fortran and COBOL days

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
who are looking for something that's fresh and exciting and want to renew their skillset

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and see participating in opensource software as a way

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to work with some of the younger people on some of the newer technologies

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and to refresh and get revitalized with their computer software skillset and interests.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.000
We have people who are part-time Mozilla contributors working on it

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
because they're interested in a particular feature set.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
We have retirees and people who have part-time jobs trying to fill the rest of their day

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and who happen to know something about what we're doing somewhere on the Mozilla project.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Sometimes that's writing client software code in C++,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
but other times that's manning our volunteer support desk and helping Firefox users

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
fix problems with their browsing experience.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So opensource really does, and many opensource projects really do, have

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000
multiple points where one can attach themselves to that project and find support and mentorship.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Some of the places you attach yourself can be very simple.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
We'll often put some of our most valuable programming resources

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
on very challenging projects and leave some of the easier or simpler features

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.000
or smaller bug fixing unowned, as it were, by a full-time staff member

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
with the idea that that staff member can instead mentor a volunteer or a student or a retiree

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
to go finish off that piece of the work.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
This is a great learning experience and an opportunity to develop a set of skills

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
that you can advance and go and become more deeply with the project over time.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Ultimately, this young 15-year-old, Blake Ross who helped launch the Firefox project

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000
moved from fixing a couple of style issues using some JavaScript and CSS on toolbar buttons

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
to being the authority on a bunch of the C++ code that made up Firefox.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
That was probably in a short time period, maybe less than 2 years

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that he was able to make that progression almost exclusively through

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
opensource mentoring relationships on the Mozilla project.
