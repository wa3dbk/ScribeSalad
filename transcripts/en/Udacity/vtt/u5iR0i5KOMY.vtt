00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now that you've solved that devious quiz,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
let's go ahead and add our text area.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're going to call this name equals art,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and remember text area is

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
not a void element like input,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
it has a closing tag, and the default text of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the text area would appear between those 2 texts.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's close this label.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Save this file and give it a test.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Okay, here we are on the browser, we reload.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Okay, now we have space for some title.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I've got this big box where we can enter in

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
our ASCII art, and all is well.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Cool.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The next thing we need to do is add the form handling.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We need to add the POST method in our application.
