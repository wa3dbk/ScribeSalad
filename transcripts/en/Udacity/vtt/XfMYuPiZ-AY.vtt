00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
So this sounds great. Partner sound wonderful but what could go wrong with this?

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.460
Let's look at partnership risks.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.520
Now everybody talks about all the great things they have in partnerships

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.040
and large companies partner all the time.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.390
Let me start with the large company partnership risks.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.390
One of the greatest partnership disasters probably ever.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.410
Now, I am in the 21st Century probably including the 20th was when Boeing was building the 787,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.580
the new jet airplane made out of carbon fiber and not only was it a unique technology advanced

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.080
but at the same time, they've decided to do something

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.120
that no other airline manufacture had ever were done.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.660
What they decide to do was instead of Boeing now building all the parts,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.820
they were going to outsource all the manufacturing risks to a series of partners,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.750
spread around the world, and while Boeing's unions and machinists argued,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.690
no they missed 50 years expertise on how to build these components.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.910
Boeing because of other pressures, both financial and union

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.980
decided that it would be a much smarter strategic move to have people building

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.170
the center fuselage in Italy and the tail fin somewhere else,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.040
and the stabilizers somewhere else, and the forward fuselage by another vendor

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.140
until all of a sudden, their supply chain was scattered around the world

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.230
and at least half these parts being made by people who've never made airplane components.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.090
It will look great on paper. It was going to save them enormous manufacturing cost.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.040
It turns out to be the worse business decision of the 21st Century,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.930
because it was made by accountants and not by engineers.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.890
It turns out their partners delayed the program by about three or four years,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.510
because there was a tremendous amount of rework--

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.790
parts didn't fit, parts didn't work, and this wasn't your living room furniture.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.940
These weren't devices that we're going to carry hundreds of people on the earth

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.850
and there was no margin for error.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.950
It turns out Boeing actually had to go buy back a good number of these manufacturers

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.080
and bring back their expertise and oversight, which they assume wouldn't be necessary.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.300
So, I just used this as an example not to bash Boeing,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.810
but to understand that even the smartest companies

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.220
sometimes made partnership decisions that look good on a spreadsheet,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.420
but at the end of the day, partnerships are not driven by spreadsheets.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.570
They are drive by technical competence customer needs,

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.880
and the ability to let her final finished quality product.
