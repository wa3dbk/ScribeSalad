enough? How can you really relive a memory from your past? Well, now, there's

sometimes, a single whiff of a long forgotten smell is enough to take you back

00:00:17.285 --> 00:00:22.448
to where you'd experienced that smell before. You might ask, how can Sniff Book

00:00:22.448 --> 00:00:26.944
make me remember these times in my life. Well, when a particle enters your

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:31.900
nose. Chemical energy gets transduced to neural energy. The neural impulses has

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.020
travel directly to the olfactory bulbs in the temporal lobes. And some of the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.162
nerve fibers of the olfactory bulb go directly to the amygdala. It is here that

00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:44.954
the magic happens. The amygdala is involved in emotion. And this is one reason

00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:49.866
why smells can sometimes bring back such clear, strong emotions. The Sniff Book
