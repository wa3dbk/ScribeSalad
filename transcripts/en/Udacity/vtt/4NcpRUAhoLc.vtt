00:00:00.072 --> 00:00:04.785
One really handy feature of Xcode is
that Alt+clicking on a class can take

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:07.150
you directly to its documentation.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.674
Let's take a closer look
at the documentation for

00:00:09.674 --> 00:00:11.244
the UIViewController class.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:15.493
Let's see what we can find in
the Interacting with Storyboard section.

00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:18.229
You're already familiar with
the storyboard property,

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:22.060
which we used to get a reference
to the dice view controller.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.370
We've also seen prepareForSegue and
performSegueWithIdentifier.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.146
It's good to become comfortable
with these methods and

00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:35.220
properties now, because they'll all come
into play again soon as we begin to work

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.831
with navigation controllers.

00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:39.615
Let's go ahead an implement
prepareForSegue in our

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:41.139
RollViewController file.

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:44.055
I want you to pay close attention
to this segue argument,

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:47.292
because it has some information
that we really need right now.

00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:51.841
In particular, the segue has this
destinationViewController property,

00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:55.360
which in this case is
the DiceViewController.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.760
And now that we have a reference
to the DiceViewController,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.070
we can set the dice values.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.340
And now let's try running it.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.180
Sweet!

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.209
We've got dice!
