00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.109
Since e taken to a power and natural log are inverses, e to the natural log of

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:11.328
x should just give us x. We can visualize this again like we did earlier. We

00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:16.746
plug in x to natural log, we end up with natural log of x. If we make the

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:21.554
exponent of e natural log of x, then we get x again. This also works if we

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:23.019
reverse the cycle.
