00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.960
Now that we've seen how file systems work, we turn

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.250
to several optimizations that help make it fast, since most storage

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.230
devices tend to be slow. We'll first discuss some software

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.760
optimizations and then turn to hardware. If you're first reaction is,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.490
let's use a cache, then you're on the right track.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.260
Indeed most operating systems do use free portions of main memory

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.260
as a cache for the much slower mass storage device. Statistics

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.100
vary on this sort of thing over time as technologies changes,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.720
but by most measurements, memory is as much as 100,000

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.360
times faster than disk for random access. Would use the

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.560
portion of memory used as a cache for disc, the

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.040
unified buffer cache, a name it earned for some obscure historical

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.260
reasons. The terminology here can be a little confusing. So

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.410
I'm going to emphasize that we're talking about in memory caching of

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.840
the contents of the disc, not the RAM on the

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.260
disc controller that the device controller here might use. When data

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.960
is read from disc, is stored in this unified buffer

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.070
cache so that subsequent reads can find it there. Instead

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.320
of having to bother the disk again, because disk access

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.160
is often sequential. It is common also to read ahead in

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.080
a file, loading up subsequent blocks to main memory so

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.020
that is there when the application needs it. Writing to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.200
disk is usually done with the write back policy. The

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.640
change is made only in the unified buffer cache at first.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.070
And the page is marked as dirty. The slower operation

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.180
of writing the data to the disk is postponed until

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.930
some more opportune time. New files can also be created

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.830
and stored in the unified buffer cache. If a file has

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.410
a very short life span, writing to the disk might

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.580
not be necessary at all. The existence of the end memory

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.740
cache. Means that a call to write isn't a guarantee

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.130
that the data is changed on the disk and will persist.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.940
The changes are only reflected in memory. The advantage is

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.290
that the program gets to resume faster and get on with

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.630
its work. The downside is that if the system crashes

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.890
before the write has been made to disk then changes will

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.690
be lost. If you really do want to make sure that

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.090
changes are reflected on disk, need to call fsync or msync

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.420
to flush out the unified buffer cache. The write-back policy of

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.130
the buffer cache is also the reason that operating systems will

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.490
warn you not to move storage devices without

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.530
ejecting it first. It needs a chance to

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.990
flush the buffer cache and any dirty pages

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.990
so that changes will be reflected on the device.
