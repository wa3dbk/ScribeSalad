00:00:00.138 --> 00:00:03.510
So, this is the general equation for any circle.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.555
The number on the end is "r" squared,

00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:08.828
and so the square root of this number is the radius.

00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:12.548
And then if there's a number next to the "x", and a number next to the "k",

00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:15.587
these are the numbers that form our center.

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:19.385
We take their opposite sign from the one that's in parenthesis.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:25.029
So, for example, if this is negative and this is negative, then both "h" and "k" will be positive.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.092
Whereas if there were positive signs inside of our equations,

00:00:28.092 --> 00:00:31.206
that means that these two values would be negative.

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:34.208
Let's check out a few examples to see this in action.

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:38.346
Here's a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 5.

00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:42.526
Notice that this equation is really the same as this one.

00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:49.127
If we subtracted or added zero to the "x" and "y" value, we'd still be at a center of (0,0).

00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:52.402
This is our "h" and this is our "k".

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:57.627
I'm gonna switch between these graphs. Right now I only have this one being shown as graphed.

00:00:57.627 --> 00:01:03.933
When I turn this one off, and turn this one on, I notice that I get the same exact graph as before.

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:08.643
And that should make sense because if we subtract zero from anything, it doesn't change the value.

00:01:08.643 --> 00:01:13.330
Here's another circle and this one has a center at (3,3).

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.186
We took our old circle and shifted it three units to the right and three units up, vertically.

00:01:19.186 --> 00:01:22.925
We can even see that if we examine two of the points on the circle.

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:29.964
This one, at (0,5) for this circle, has now been moved to (3,8), for this circle.

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:34.465
We moved it three units right for the "x", from 0 to 3,

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:38.072
and three units vertically from 5 to 8.

00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:42.176
And it turns out that this is true for all the points on this circle.

00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:47.769
We can examine another point and see that it was moved three units right and then three units up.

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:50.044
And here's a different circle.

00:01:50.044 --> 00:01:55.873
This one's been shifted four units to the left, and then one unit up, vertically.

00:01:55.873 --> 00:02:01.294
And notice, too, that the center of this new circle is at (-4,1).

00:02:01.294 --> 00:02:07.712
This is the "h" value and it's opposite in sign of the equation, and this is the "k" value

00:02:07.712 --> 00:02:10.340
which is opposite of this number in the equation.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.279
Here's one final graph.

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:16.421
For this one, it's been shifted two units left and two units down.

00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:20.316
And if we examine its center, it's at (-2,-2).

00:02:20.316 --> 00:02:24.221
Notice that these two signs are opposite than the ones in the equation.

00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:28.147
Here's our "h" value, and its opposite which is -2,

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:31.531
and here's our "k" value, which is opposite, so -2.

00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:35.091
Now that you've seen the general equation for any circle,

00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:40.164
I want you to try and figure out what are the centers and radiuses for each of these circles?

00:02:40.164 --> 00:02:45.117
Work carefully, and don't forget to pay attention to the minus and addition signs.

00:02:45.117 --> 00:02:46.633
Good luck!
