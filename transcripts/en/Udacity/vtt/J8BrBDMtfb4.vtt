00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.676
The code itself is pretty straightforward. We set the vertex positions then

00:00:03.676 --> 00:00:07.420
make a triangle face. Nothing fancy there. We then create the three colors red,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.907
green and blue. Finally an array of these three colors is assigned to the face

00:00:10.907 --> 00:00:14.452
itself. One thing worth noting is that these vertex colors are actually

00:00:14.452 --> 00:00:18.212
multiplied by the materials color when displayed. Since the material color is

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:21.116
by default a solid white it doesn't have a noticeable effect in this particular

00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:22.279
case.
