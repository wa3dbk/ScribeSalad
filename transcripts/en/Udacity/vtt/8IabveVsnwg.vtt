00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's check the variables that are read by B.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is the variable C and the variable quote.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
let's first check C. Where is C being written?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
C is being assigned here in this for statement.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Therefore, this statement indeed is what B is dependent upon.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Next one down here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here we have C and quote again, but they are only being read and not written.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Therefore, these do not influence the data at B.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Down here we have quote equals not quote. This is obvious.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Quote is being set, and therefore we have a data dependency.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Finally here, we have out equals out plus C.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Here the out variable is being written, but nothing in here reads the out variable.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Therefore, there is no data dependency.
