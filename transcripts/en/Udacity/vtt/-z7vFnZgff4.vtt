00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.170
The security of a device
should be established

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.760
when the device is turned on initially.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.480
IOS uses trusted bootchain
to achieve this goal.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.658
When an iOS is turned on,
each application processor immediately

00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:18.090
executes code from boot only
memory known as the bootrom.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.150
This immutable code known as
the hardware root of trust,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.400
is laid down during chip fabrication and
is implicitly trusted.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.990
In other words,
this code is brunt into the hardware.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.350
The bootrom code contains
the Apple root CA public key,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.860
which is used to verify
that the low level loader,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.060
LLB is signed by Apple properly
before allowing it to load.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.590
This is the first step in the chain
of trust where each step ensures that

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.130
the next is signed by Apple properly.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.430
When the LLB finishes its tasks,
it verifies and

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.740
runs the next stage below the iBoot.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.920
Which in turn verifies and
runs the iOS kernel.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.870
This secure bootchain helps ensure that

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.170
the lowest levels of software
are not tampered with.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.950
And allows iOS to run only
on validated Apple devices.
