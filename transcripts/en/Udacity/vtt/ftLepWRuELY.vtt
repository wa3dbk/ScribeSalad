00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.139
So remember that we only fetch each source object once,

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.539
but we have to distribute that information across all P threads,

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:10.935
and for each destination object, again we're going to fetch that information once,

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:15.370
but then we have to distribute that information across all P source threads.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.782
It would be nicer if we didn't have to do this because we can store that information in shared memory once,

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:22.947
but then we have to read out of shared memory,

00:00:22.947 --> 00:00:27.150
which is slower, or we have to replicate that information in each thread's local storage,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.551
which wastes space and limits the number of threads we can have resident in a single thread block.

00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:35.838
The second downside is that we have to communicate between threads to sum up the forces.

00:00:35.838 --> 00:00:40.562
So we've individually computed each separate force on separate threads,

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:45.634
and then we have to communicate between all these threads to sum up the force for this particular tile.

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:49.634
We'd prefer not to have to do that either, so instead we'll look at another way to compute a tile.
