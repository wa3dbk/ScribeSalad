00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.545
This last example actually gives us a clue as to how to find the horizontal

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:09.568
asymptote of a rational function. We started off with f of x equals 4 over x

00:00:09.568 --> 00:00:15.000
minus 1 plus 1. And as x gets bigger, this fraction is going to get smaller and

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.560
smaller. Eventually we're going to end up with f of x equals 1 plus something

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.112
that's almost zero. This means, as we saw from the graph, that our horizontal

00:00:25.112 --> 00:00:30.451
asymptote will be at y equals 1. So how can we reverse the process that we went

00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:35.465
through of combining two fractions? In other words, if we started out with x

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:42.510
plus 3 over x minus 1, how can we get back to 1 plus 4 over X minus 1? Should

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.120
we divide the numerator by the denominator? Should we divide the denominator by

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.700
the numerator? Should we subtract the denominator from numerator? Or should we

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.910
subtract the numerator from the denominator?
