00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.115
The final answer we get when multiplying these complex numbers together is

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:10.116
negative 7 plus 22i. So how do we get this? Well, as before, we need to make

00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:15.446
sure each term in the first set of parenthesis is multiplied by each term in the

00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:20.706
second set of parenthesis. So we start with 4 and multiply it by 2. And then

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:24.931
also by 3i. And then we take 5i and multiply it by 2 and then by 3i as well.

00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:29.417
Then we just need to simplify it within each of these terms over here, combine

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:33.914
like terms and come up with our final answer. I think the trickiest thing here

00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:38.489
is thinking about these middle terms and thinking about the final term. We can

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.782
see here that multiplication involving imaginary numbers Works in pretty much

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:49.147
the same that working with real numbers and variables does. We have 4 times 3i,

00:00:49.147 --> 00:00:54.314
the 4 multiplies the 3 to make 12. And then the i is still a factor,so it's

00:00:54.314 --> 00:00:59.819
multiplied in as well. 5i times 3i is just 5 times 3 times i times i or 15 times

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.180
i squared, which is negative 1.
