00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay. Another difference is, in this class, we've been talking about SQL

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and in the app store, we've got something a little different.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's called "G-quel"--GQL

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and it's basically a simplified version of SQL

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that works only in the Datastore.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And the main difference is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
all queries begin with SELECT*

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so there's no way to select individual columns--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So this actually simplifies a lot of queries we can do.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For example, we can't do joins,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which is why I didn't want to spend a whole lot of

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
time on joins earlier.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Even if I were working in a SQL database,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I probably wouldn't be doing a whole lot of joins

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and in the App Engine Datastore,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
we won't be doing any joins whatsoever because it's not possible.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
When we're using GQL--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
actually, we don't even have to use GQL at all.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The Datastore has a kind of procedural language you could use as well.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But since we've spent all this time practicing SQL

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and you'll probably use it elsewhere in your career,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we're going to use GQL for this example.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So we can at least have some consistency there.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Another difference is in a kind of generic

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
SQL database, as we've been talking about.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You can run arbitrary queries--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
no matter how slow, with or without indices.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And in App Engine, all queries must be indexed.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This is important, right--because

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
when you're running your own database, you can do whatever you want.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But Google--it's very nice of them to give us this whole system for free--

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
at least for small-use cases--

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but we can't beat their machines to death.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
All the queries must be indexed.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It's actually not just so we don't beat them to death

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but it's just the way the whole system is built.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
As you get more familiar with it, it'll kind of make sense--

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
why things are designed the way they are.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So for the most part, in this example

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that I'm going to build and your homework,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
you won't actually have to build any indices yourself.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Google App Engine will actually build the indices for you,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which is really handy.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
If you wanted control over what indices they build--

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
yes, you can do that yourself.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Sometimes, it might build, not the most efficient index,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and you can define your own--so that's pretty cool as well.
