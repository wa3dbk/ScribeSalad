00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this question you're asked to modify the compute ranks code

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in order to take into consideration whether links are reciprocal or not.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What we want to know is is a - c a reciprocal link?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's a reciprocal link if there is a path from c back to a of at most length k

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
where k is a number that's given to us.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If there is a path back then we won't include a in the calculation for c's rank.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm going to look at values of k-- k = 0.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm going to ask is a - c reciprocal?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Then from that I'll be able to tell whether to include a or not in the calculation of c's rank.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is the link we're looking at.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If k = 0 the only links that are excluded are the self links--link to the page itself.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So a - c is not reciprocal in this case, and we should include a in c's calculation.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If k = 1, we're looking to see if there is a direct link back from c to a, and there isn't.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So a - c is not reciprocal and we should include a.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If k = 2, we need to see if there's a path of length 2 from c to a.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If we start at c, then we can only get to d.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That's just one of the two links we're allowed to click on to get back to a.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
What we want to know now is can we click on one link from d to get back to a?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The answer is no. We can't, which means that a - c is not reciprocal. We should include a.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If k = 3, we're going to do the same again. We start at c.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We go to d, using up one link.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Then we want to know if by using two clicks we can get back from d to a.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Let's have a look at that. From d we can get to b.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Then that uses up one link, and then can we get to a with one more link?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Yes, we can, because there is a direct link from b to a,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
which means that a - c is reciprocal and we should not include a.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
If k &gt;= 3, then there is definitely a path of length at least three in there,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
which means we should not include a for any values of k &gt;= 3.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Now we're going to code that.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We're going to code a procedure to check whether a - c is reciprocal,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and then we're going to edit the code and compute ranks to take that into consideration.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
This is the supplied code.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I'm going to change it to include a second input k.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Then we want to know whether we have that reciprocal link or not. We include the page.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
If we don't have a reciprocal link in the graph,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000
we're going to include node in the calculation if the link node to page is not reciprocal.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I just need to adjust the spacing here, and that's all the change that we need to do to compute ranks.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
To code it's reciprocal link, I'm going to use recursion.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
If k is 0--that was the first case we looked at in the example--

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
then we have a reciprocal link whenever the destination and the source are the same.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
In that case, I'll return true and otherwise we return false.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
If k is not equal to 0, then it's at least 1, which means if there is a direct link

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
from the destination to the source, then there is most definitely a reciprocal link.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000
If that's not the case, we're going to look at every node that is linked to from destination.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.000
We're going to check if there is a path of links from that node to the source of length k - 1.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
We're already used one step going from destination to node.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
That leaves us with k - 1 steps left.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000
If there is a path--in other words, if reciprocal link graphs in the same graph--

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
we've got the same source.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We've got our new node, which is hopefully one step closer to the destination.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
If that's true, then we're going to return true.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
If there is no node for which that's true, we're going to return false.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
That completes the procedure.
