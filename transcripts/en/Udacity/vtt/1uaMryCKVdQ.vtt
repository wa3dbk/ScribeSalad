00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.680
Going back to what Rato said, frame layout, linear layout, and relative layout

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.790
are three of the most common layouts you will use in building out your UI.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.860
These all descend from the view group class, designed to contain and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.870
give order to child views. They each have their strengths and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.080
you should always try to use this simplest layout that will get the job done.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.240
Frame Layout is great for simple layouts when you only have one child to view,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.560
like a list view that fills the entire content area. Linear layout is

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.640
perfect for stacking the views vertically or horizontally, one after another,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.610
it is also the only way to break up the display proportionately. Relative layout

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.200
is powerful but a bit more complicated compared to the others. Throw a bunch of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.490
views inside a relative layout, and then you can configure each views

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.070
position relative to parent, the relative layout, or to sibling views, tons of

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.320
possibilities. We'll explore these layouts in greater detail when we build more

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.010
complex screens. For now, let's get back to building our forecast list.
