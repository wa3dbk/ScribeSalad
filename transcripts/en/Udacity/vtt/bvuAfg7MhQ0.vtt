Let's begin with the biological treatments starting with drug therapy. By this

00:00:05.048 --> 00:00:07.843
time in the course you are well versed in the importance of neurotransmitters

00:00:07.843 --> 00:00:11.915
and brain functioning. And in the last lesson, we discussed the medical model

00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:17.630
of mental illness. Here we see that drug therapy follows that medical model.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.486
That is, we can prescribe medicines that change the functioning of

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:25.530
neurotransmitters. Which in turn can alleviate the symptoms of mental illness.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.050
Now, remember these drugs are called psychotropic drugs.
