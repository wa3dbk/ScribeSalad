00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.730
As we've seen relaxing the requirement to find the best possible solutions can allow us to find

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.650
polynomial time algorithms for NP complete problems.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.650
At least some times, so approximability is something

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.860
that varies very much from problem to problem.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.490
For some problems, we know that we cannot approximate them at all, unless P=NP.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.920
Other problems such as vertex cover at least have a constant factor approximation algorithm.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.370
And then there are those very, very well-behaved problems such as

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.110
knapsack for which we know polynomial time approximation schemes.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.540
But what if still all of this doesn't help? Well, in that case, we will literally have to start poking around.

00:00:41.540 --> 99:59:59.000
We'll be talking about randomization.
