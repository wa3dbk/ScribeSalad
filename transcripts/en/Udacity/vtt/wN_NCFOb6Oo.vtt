00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.284
Let's get back to our original circle with a radius of 50 units. Here's the

00:00:05.284 --> 00:00:10.076
circle, and then this is the center of the circle, 0,0. It's at the origin.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:14.900
Now, not every single circle we encounter will be centered at the origin. Let's

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.235
try and move this one. Say we wanted to move the center 20 units to the right,

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:25.009
to this point. This means if we move the center 20 units to the right. Then

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.195
every other point on the graph must also move 20 units to the right. What would

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:35.470
be the coordinates of these four points if we move them 20 units to the right?
