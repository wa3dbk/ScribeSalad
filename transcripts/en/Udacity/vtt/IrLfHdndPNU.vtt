00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.300
Let's try a second problem on motion. This time, we have a bus traveling 10

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.864
miles per hour slower than a passenger van. If the bus can travel 200 miles in

00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:12.646
the same amount of time that the van can travel 240 miles, find the speed of

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:18.189
each vehicle. Now, we're not going to do this entire problem in one step. But

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.850
if you can, great. We're going to break this problem into steps just like we

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.268
did before. So we have a bus and we have a van. Which of these do you think

00:00:27.268 --> 00:00:29.620
would be the best choice for our variable?
