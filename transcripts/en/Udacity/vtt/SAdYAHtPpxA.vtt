00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.820
So we can get part of the idea really
simply by just replacing this equation

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.490
with something that says for
all state and

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.620
action, the value of the state is bigger
than or equal to this expression.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.800
This is essentially the q value, for
each assay this is the q value assay.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.231
So that's good and
know we have to add that min thing.

00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:20.437
So what do we minimize here?

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.017
&gt;&gt; V.

00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:24.895
&gt;&gt; So we can't just minimize V like
that, because that's a vector.

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:25.501
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:28.700
we can't just minimize V sub s
because s is unbound here [LAUGH].

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.259
Right, it's like which s
do we want to minimize?

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.254
So we kind of want to
minimize all of them somehow.

00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:38.749
So the way we're going to write that,
if this turns out to work.

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:40.560
Is minimize the sum.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.520
So that's going to put pressure on all
the individual Vs to be as small as they

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.630
can be, so

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.020
that it actually equals the maxes,
it isn't just an upper bound on the max.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.930
&gt;&gt; Right,
because if any one of them isn't,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.430
then you don't have the minimum sum.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.090
&gt;&gt; Right, then you can always
move it down a little bit.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.555
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So this actually is a linear program,

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:59.467
that is the solution to which is
equivalent to the solution to the MDP.

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:03.205
So we can just write down this linear
program and give it to a linear program

00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:06.967
solver that runs in polynomial time,
and boom, we get our values V sub s.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.010
How do we get our policy from that?

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.400
&gt;&gt; We just choose the action that always
in expectation gives you the best value,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.140
just sort of one [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.433
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we choose the greedy policy
with respect to that optimal value

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:18.011
function.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:18.569
So this is cool.

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:20.693
This is sometimes called the Primal.

00:01:20.693 --> 00:01:22.818
I guess because it
lives out in the woods.

00:01:22.818 --> 00:01:26.555
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Representation of the linear

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.740
program for solving MDPs.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.593
And this is a perfectly
reasonable [LAUGH],

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:33.440
this is actually very useful
from a theoretical perspective.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.760
I haven't seen too many people really
use Linear Programming to solve MDPs.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.470
It's got some overhead associated
with it that seems to make it

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.160
a little bit difficult to get it to run
competitively with the other algorithms.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.940
But it's okay, especially if you have a
really good Linear Programming package.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.710
And if you happen to have other kinds
of linear constraints that you need to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.490
throw in,
this is a very convenient way of solving

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.620
slightly more difficult problems, MDPs
plus a little bit of extra constraint.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.620
So, does that make sense?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.530
Are you good with that?

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm good with that.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.670
&gt;&gt; All right, I want to say one
more thing about Linear Programming

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.380
by switching away from the Primal
to what's called the dual.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.950
So, Linear Programming has this nice
property that you can actually [LAUGH].

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.360
Any linear program, you can change
the constraints into variables and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.850
the variables into constraints,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.620
and you get a new linear program
that's equivalent to the old one.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.550
So this is just true in general for
Linear Programming.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.730
It's linear programming duality.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.140
And sometimes it's a really useful
way of actually solving them and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.270
for putting bounds and
constraints on the solutions.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.720
But in the context of MDPs it actually
does something kind of cool, so

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.860
I want to show you that.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.450
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.260
Is it going to be as cool as what
happened when we did support

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.300
factor machines?

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.800
&gt;&gt; I don't remember that.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.590
&gt;&gt; We did the same thing.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.620
We wrote down a series of equations and
we solved for the dual.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.340
&gt;&gt; Nice!

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.208
So, yes, it'll be the same
amount of cool as that.

00:02:52.208 --> 00:02:52.926
&gt;&gt; Excellent, excellent.

00:02:52.926 --> 00:02:53.730
I look forward to it.
