Well hello again. Remember a while ago we had that fancy cat food, $4.35, a

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.890
jar. And then we did some computations, and there were round off errors, and I

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.264
said, oh, just convert it to pennies. I guess like this. Go ahead and give this

00:00:15.264 --> 00:00:19.895
a try. Does it work for you? Or do you get a compiler error? Or are you off by

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:23.770
one penny? Or do you get something that's almost the right answer, but off by a

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.989
few fractions of a penny? Do it yourself, and let me know.
