00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.650
So why are we working on
the recognition problem?

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.090
Well, recognition,
it's a fundamental part of perception.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.200
Whether you're talking about robots,
autonomous agents, whatever.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.140
The idea is that the ability
to know what things are and

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.916
therefore how you want to interact
with them, is it really important?

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:17.010
It, it's gives you
a way of organizing and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.420
thinking about the visual
content of the world.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.370
And perhaps even more importantly,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.200
it's a very human way of
thinking about things, right?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.830
I, I give objects labels, and
if I tell you to go pick up the cup and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.820
put it away,
you know what I'm talking about.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.400
So we want our machines and
systems to be able to do that too.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.300
So for example, autonomous agents,
and here's a pair.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.610
The one on the left is a robot.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.890
This is from Karlsruhe, and Rüdiger
Dillmann's work on, domestic robot.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.990
And this robot has to be able to go
pick up cups out of dishwashers.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.310
It has to know that
there is a dishwasher.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.804
It has to see that, oh,
I put that cup down, it didn't make it,

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:54.110
I'm going to go get it.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.890
It has to be able to be told
that the cups go over there.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.010
All right?

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.910
So if I'm going to communicate
about these things to that robot,

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.810
I'm going to use labels that
talk about these objects.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.150
Even in autonomous systems.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.960
So here, I think this was, Stanley.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.440
I think that was one of the Urban Grand
Challenge vehicles, one of the winners.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.790
It has to understand
that this is a thing and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.510
this thing we know
that it's called a car.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.560
All it needs to know is it's this thing
that it's learned a lot of things about.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.663
And that this kind of thing which
are cars do things like continue moving,

00:01:25.663 --> 00:01:29.966
might stop, have certain behaviors,
likewise that this object there might

00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:33.750
move in your way and it uses a lot
of machine learning to do that.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.130
Maybe not quite the traditional
labeling in the way.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.818
But the idea is that these autonomous
agents understand the nature of,

00:01:40.818 --> 00:01:43.510
of the world being carved up in objects.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.580
And I can communicate about them and
it can autonomously detect them.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.470
Labeling people.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.670
That's a recognition task.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.290
This is something we do all the time.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.150
You know, every time you tag folks
on Facebook, and it both finds that

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.700
it is a face, and we'll talk
about detection in a little bit.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.730
But also,
you might want to know who it is.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.750
Peter Belhumeur and folks did these
digital field guides where you'd like to

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.119
be able to like maybe take a picture
of a leaf and say you know,

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.290
what kind of leaf is that?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.508
If you're into that nature
kind of thing which I'm not.

00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:12.070
But it's this idea of being able to,
to recognize things.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.540
And maybe you've found some
really expensive stuff online and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.410
you say please find me more
shoes that look like this.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.330
For any relatives of mine that I'm
still continuing to subsidize.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.800
So, you could use computer vision to
help you find less expensive shoes.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.740
Just saying.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.860
All right.
The idea of, you know,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.800
can I find something that
looks kind of like that, so

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.080
I have to recognize that it's a shoe.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.950
Maybe it's already labeled as a shoe,
recognize the type, that kind of thing.
