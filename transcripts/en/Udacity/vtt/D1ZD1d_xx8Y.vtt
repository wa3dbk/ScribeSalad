00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.190
So, now that we know where turtle exists within Python, I

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.810
want to return back to our code. By the way, I

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.750
had to reduce the font size of the code a little

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.760
bit, so we could see all of it in the same frame.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.160
Now, what we have done thus far is, created an instance

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.100
of a class called turtle, we called it brad and brad draws

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.960
a square. If we can do that, we can make another

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.506
example or instance of the class turtle. And we can call it,

00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:33.170
let's say, angie. There it is. Now, I want angie to draw a circle.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.960
A circle of radius, let's say, 100. I also want angie's shape to be in

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.730
the form of an arrow and I want angie's color to be blue. There

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.040
it is. So, let me save and run this thing and see how it looks.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.710
Aha, it seems we have brad making a yellow square and

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.770
angie making a blue circle. It seems like we are getting somewhere.
