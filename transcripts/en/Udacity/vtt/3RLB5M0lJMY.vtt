This lesson is about the critical role
that data plays in the practice of

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.120
medicine, the benefits of introducing
digital records into that practice,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.450
and the two key challenges
in trying to do that.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.230
Efficiently and
accurately collecting high quality,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.250
comprehensive clinical
data from busy and

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.570
often computer-averse providers, and
visualizing EHR data in a way that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.000
supports the providers' mental model in
order to improve the quality of care.
