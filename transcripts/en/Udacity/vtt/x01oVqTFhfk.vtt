What's great about knowing scientific notation an the property of exponents, is

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.320
that it can make these types of calculations a lot easier. We can actually

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.105
perform this without using a calculator. First I can change each of the numbers

00:00:11.105 --> 00:00:14.696
into scientific notation and I need to make sure that I'm multiplying these

00:00:14.696 --> 00:00:18.374
together, we still have multiplication between each of the numbers. This

00:00:18.374 --> 00:00:22.406
numerator and this denominator are really just products of factors, so I can

00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:26.289
regroup things. I'm going to regroup my powers of 10 next to one another, and

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.377
put the numbers next to one another. And here's where our exponent properties

00:00:30.377 --> 00:00:34.298
come into play. I want you to simplify these powers of 10. What would be the

00:00:34.298 --> 00:00:38.438
single exponent on the power of 10, if we simplified this part of the fraction?

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.032
