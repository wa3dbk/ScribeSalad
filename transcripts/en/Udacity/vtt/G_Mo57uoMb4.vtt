00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.280
Thank you for finishing your assignments. I will

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.460
be providing feedback on the discussion forums periodically.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.142
Okay, so I now want to talk about how

00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:10.150
Python knows about this thing called the turtle.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.970
Well, inside the Python Standard Library, there is this file called

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.620
turtle. Turtle with a lowercase t, and inside that

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.870
file is something new. And that something new is called a class.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.840
A class Turtle with an upper case T. Now,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.330
this is a little different than what we have

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.700
seen thus far. What we have done thus far

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.010
is some sort of file, like web browser, dot some

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.620
sort of function, like open. But we haven't seen

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.390
this thing called a class. Which begs the question, what

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.450
is a class? For now you can think of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.040
a class as a neatly packaged box, that puts things

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.500
together really well. And it allows us to

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.850
write code like turtle.Turtle, with these strange looking

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.920
brackets. As if we were calling a function. In fact, when we do it on this piece

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.060
of code, we are in fact calling a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.670
function, a function called init which is defined inside

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.400
the class Turtle. Init stands for initialize, and

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.130
what it does is it creates space in memory

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.960
for a new instance or a new object of the class Turtle. This instance we called

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.180
brad. Brad can now access all of the rest of the methods that are inside

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.012
class Turtle. Like forward, and right. Forward makes

00:01:33.012 --> 00:01:35.824
brad turn forward, and right makes brad turn

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:38.240
to the right. Don't take my word for

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.210
it, let's look for them in the documentation.
