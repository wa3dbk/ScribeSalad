00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.883
While there's no one official
definition for DevOps,

00:00:02.883 --> 00:00:06.520
there are several different descriptions
that practitioners have come up with.

00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:10.790
One of them is that DevOps is
the practice of operations and

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.420
development engineers participating
together in the entire

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.000
service life cycle from design to
development and to production support.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.690
Another definition coined by the folks
at Chef Defines Devops as a cultural and

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.810
professional movement, focused on how
we build and operate high velocity

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.620
organizations, born from
the experiences of its practitioners.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.120
Now, we should be clear that
development roles here don't

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.920
just include people who's title is
developer or software engineer.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.510
It's everybody who's involved in making
the software before it hits production,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.640
like product managers and QA testers.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.450
And operations roles likewise include
everyone who's involved in running and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.420
maintaining production, systems
engineers, DBAs, network engineers,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.670
security folks, and so on.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.080
So, if DevOps is a practice,
how exactly do you do it?

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.100
Well the first practitioners
who started the movement,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.300
also coined the acronym CAMS.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.870
It stands for Culture, Automation,
Measurement and Sharing.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.010
We'll talk more about
each of these components.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.570
But first let's check in
on what DevOps is not.
