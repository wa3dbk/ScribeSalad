00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
Let's take a look at the first step of customer discovery.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.320
You're going to be living this for the next couple of weeks

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.950
if you're doing this for real.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.260
Phase 1 is you state your hypotheses and you draw the business model canvas.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.490
And again, you put the canvas on the wall, you and your team get around

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.590
and put up yellow stickies.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.930
But the next step is you get out of the building.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.670
You're going to test the problem.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.320
You're going to test your understanding of the customer's problem or need,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.290
and you're going to figure out how to build the prototype.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.550
The next thing is you're going to test the solution,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.710
and you're going to test the solution if you're on the Web

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.050
by building a low fidelity and then a high fidelity prototype,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.750
and you're going to again test your understanding of the customers' needs

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.080
and whether your solution matches this.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.530
And this match, again, is called product market fit.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.630
That's the holy grail for entrepreneurs.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.500
Am I building something that people can't get enough of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.150
or are just willing to open up their wallet's and empty it in front of you to get their hands on?

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.230
And the fourth phase in customer discovery is you verify your pivot.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.209
Do people agree that you're solving a high value problem or need,

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.840
and do you understand your business model enough to start test selling,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.820
which is the next step in customer validation.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.560
Now, what's really depressing to most entrepreneurs

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.300
is the answer most often the first time you go through this is, "Heck no."

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.390
And what's worse is, "Well, they kind of, sort of like..."

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.200
Well, kind of, sort of is not a startup.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.400
Kind of, sort of is people have been nice to you.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.650
The only time you know that you have something that's worth investing your time

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.370
and money in is if people are literally trying to force their money on you

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.110
or can't use your product even in its buggy, uninitialized form enough.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.780
This is what you're looking for.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.280
And if you haven't found it yet, that's why the customer development process

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.190
is an iterative circle.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.300
It assumes you will be going through this multiple times.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.550
And when you finally, finally think you do have something that matches customer needs,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.550
you get to the next step, which is customer validation.
