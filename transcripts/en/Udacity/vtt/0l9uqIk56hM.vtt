00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:14.960
The pseudocode should print 10, then 5, 16, 8, 4, 2. We start out with n is 10.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.596
And then, check if n is still greater than 1, print n, which is 10. Then, if n

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:25.335
is even, which it is, because it's 10. We update n to be half of n, and then we

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:33.536
skip the stuff in the else. We come back here, n is still greater than 1. This

00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:40.083
time, it's 5, so we print n 5. And then if n is even, which it isn't, we would

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:46.883
have done that. So we go to the else, and we update n to be 3 times 5 plus 1.

00:00:46.883 --> 00:00:52.131
So 15, 16. We come back up to the while and check again. And it's still greater

00:00:52.131 --> 00:01:00.435
than 1. 16, so we print 16, n is even. So we update n to be n over 2, so it's 8

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:06.744
now, skip the else. Check again. 8 is greater than 1, so we print 8. n is even,

00:01:06.744 --> 00:01:15.715
8 is even, so n is 8 over 2, is 4. Skip the else, come back up. 4 is greater

00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:23.770
than 1, so we print 4. If n is even, it is. So, n becomes 4 over 2, so it's 2.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.195
Skip the else. 2 is greater than 1, so we print n. Print 2. n is even so we

00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:36.775
update it. n becomes 2 over 2, so it's 1. Skip the else. Now, n is no longer

00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:41.302
greater than 1. So we drop out of the bottom, and we're done. If this still

00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:45.310
looks a little foreign, that's okay. We're going to do more practice with

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.724
pseudo code later.
