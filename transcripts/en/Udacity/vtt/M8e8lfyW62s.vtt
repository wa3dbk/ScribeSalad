00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's look at the solution
to our memory refresh quiz.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.420
We have a memory with 4096 rows and
this many columns.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.780
It needs to be refreshed
every 500 microseconds.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.810
And this is our read timing, where
these two steps and this one overlap.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.706
So basically,
it takes us 4 plus 10 plus either 11 or

00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:27.296
2 plus 4 nanoseconds before
we complete one read and

00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:29.950
can proceed with the next one.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.390
Because 2 plus 4 is 6.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.430
And 11 nanoseconds is longer.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.880
That means that, really, the timing for
our read will be to select a row.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.960
So we need to select a row,
get the values from the row, and

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.430
then write the data back.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.400
During this time,
the row needs to remain selected.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.090
So the new read really cannot
begin until 4 plus 10 plus

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.437
11 nanoseconds into it.

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:59.820
So the read takes 25 nanoseconds.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.562
And that means we could be doing 40
million reads per second if all we had

00:01:04.562 --> 00:01:06.410
to do is do reads.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.975
And this is where it becomes tricky,

00:01:08.975 --> 00:01:13.840
because during a second we need
to do a number of refreshes.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.640
The refresh period is 500 microseconds.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.720
So the number of refreshes we have
to do it 2,000 times per second.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.320
We need to do a refresh
of each of the rows.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.970
To do that,
the row needs to be selected.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.820
We need to get the bit value and
write it back, so

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.060
it takes the same time to do a refresh
of the row as it takes to do a read.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.930
Meanwhile, our memory
cannot be doing the read.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.842
So, really, we're expanding 2,000 x

00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:49.890
4,096 x 25 nanoseconds on refreshes.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.508
But because they have
the same timing as reads,

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:56.250
we can just compute how many
refreshes we have per second.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.240
And we end up with 8.192
million refreshes per second.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.690
And that means that we cannot
do all 40 million reads.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.229
Pretty much out of these really, this
was assuming that we don't do refreshes.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.729
So because we have to do eight and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.800
change million refreshes, we have
that many less reads that we can do.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.410
So the overall result here is
the difference between the two.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.027
That's how many reads do we have left
after we have spent time on eight and

00:02:26.027 --> 00:02:28.250
change million refreshes?

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.574
So the final answer here is
the difference between this

00:02:32.574 --> 00:02:37.090
which is 31,808,000 reads per second.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.910
So again, without refreshes we
would be able to do 40 million.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.140
But because refreshes need to happen.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.030
We only have this many
reads left in a second.
