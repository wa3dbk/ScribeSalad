00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.610
Now let's discuss hash based
approach to message authentication.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.550
Using hash values for message
authentication has several advantages.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.140
For example, hash functions
are very efficient to compute.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.040
And libraries of hash functions
are widely available.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.270
On the other hand, a hash function such
as SHA cannot be used directly and

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.455
by itself for message authentication
because it does not rely on a secret.

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:31.790
There have been a number of proposals
to incorporate a secret key

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.825
into an existing hash function.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:37.945
The approach that has received
the most support is HMAC, and

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:42.785
it has been adopted to other
protocols such as IPsec and TLS.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:45.709
Here's an illustration
of how HMAC works.

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:50.415
HMAC invokes a hash function and
also secret key K.

00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:55.052
The message M consists of
multiple blocks of b bits, for

00:00:55.052 --> 00:00:57.330
example, for SHA 512.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.584
Each block is 1,024 bits,
so b would be 1,024.

00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:06.210
So the key K would be
first padded to b bits.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.709
This is accomplished by simply
appending zeros to the end of K.

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:13.595
Then the padded key is XORed with ipad,

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:19.030
which is a constant designed to
eliminate any irregularities of the key.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.459
And the result is a b bit S1.

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:25.510
S1 is prepended to the original message.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.500
Then the entire message there is S1, and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.360
the original message is hashed
to produce a n bit hash value.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.126
For example, if the hash function
is SHA 512, then n will be 512.

00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:44.100
Then the n bit hash value again
will be padded to b bits.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.130
Then the padded key,
K+, is XORed with opad.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.060
Again, opad is another constant designed
to eliminate irregularities in the key.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.030
The result is a b bit value, S0.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.360
The padded hash is then appended to S0,
and the entire message is hashed.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.810
And the n bit result is HMAC of
the message with the key, K.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.090
And this is how HMAC works.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.840
To summarize,
HMAC uses an existing hash function and

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.430
includes a secret key,
K, in the processing.
