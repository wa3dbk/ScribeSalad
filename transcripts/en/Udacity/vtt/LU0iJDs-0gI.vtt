00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.794
First, to keep track of its position in the world, that's correct. All of our

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:06.112
entities in grids, need to know what position in the world they're at for a

00:00:06.112 --> 00:00:09.976
number of reasons, like physics, collision and rendering. What about this, to

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:14.450
know when it's time to die? this is actually not required. Not all entities

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.930
have a concept of time, nor have a concept of death. For instance, landmine

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.866
entities only live on the map for about 30 seconds. As such, they need to know

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:26.694
how long they're staying around in life before they explode. Other entities

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:30.580
like these spawners, which will actually generate energy canisters and health

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.214
canisters, never die. So they have no concept of life or death. They stick

00:00:35.214 --> 00:00:38.630
around until the map is unloaded. What about this one? To think or be able to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.310
do something each tick? This one is definitely a requirement. The definition as

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.334
an entity as we've discussed before, is that you have a class which contains

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:49.454
some unique logic, that makes this entity different from all the other ones in

00:00:49.454 --> 00:00:55.060
the world. The ability to think or have custom processing associated with an

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.243
entity, is critical to its definition. How about knowing what sounds to play?

00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:04.522
this is a little vague. Some entities will need the ability to know, and play

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:08.588
sounds during events. For instance, when a rocket hits the wall, we would hope

00:01:08.588 --> 00:01:09.932
that it plays its explosion sound

00:01:09.932 --> 00:01:11.153
[SOUND].

00:01:11.153 --> 00:01:13.832
The player for instance, may not need to know any sounds, because the

00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:17.653
environment is making sounds on their behalf. And finally, what about the need

00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:21.664
to post to your Google Plus Stream? this is more of wishful thinking on my

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:24.979
part, but in reality you shouldn't be coding in the ability to do HTTP requests

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.182
to each one of the entities in your game. Although, you should definitely check

00:01:30.182 --> 00:01:31.880
out this place, I hear it's cool.
