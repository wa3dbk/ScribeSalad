00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.560
This project is already split in some
virtual folders that will get us

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.330
thinking about the Model view and
Controller.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.020
The AppDelegate and the GCDBlackbox have
been place outside of this folders and

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.110
we can ignore them for now.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.140
In the Model folder, we have this
clients folder and then under Clients,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.140
we have TMDB for the movie database.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.410
This folder structure represents
the idea that we could have multiple

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.190
clients or managers that handle all the
code related to an API, but since we're

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.550
only working with the movie database,
we just have the single TMDB folder, but

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.390
you could imagine others like one for
Flickr or Facebook or so forth.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.162
Now in the TMDB folder, we have SWF
files that pertain to the main model of

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:46.014
our project, the TMDB movie as well
as the API's configs, constants and

00:00:46.014 --> 00:00:50.964
a TMBD client that will handle all
the communications with the API itself.

00:00:50.964 --> 00:00:52.804
We'll talk about this more later.

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:57.097
You'll also notice there's this
one controller-like file called

00:00:57.097 --> 00:00:58.804
TMBDOffViewController.

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:02.879
We've designated this file as part of
the model instead of the controller,

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.702
because it's used specifically for
the movie databases off-flow and

00:01:06.702 --> 00:01:07.544
nowhere else.

00:01:07.544 --> 00:01:12.348
But that was just our design decision,
it doesn't have to be this way.

00:01:12.348 --> 00:01:14.642
If we look inside the TMDBClient file,

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:17.848
we see that the client is
only partially implemented.

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:21.768
These two methods here
are still commented out.

00:01:21.768 --> 00:01:25.738
Here at the top, we've moved
the authentication state into this class

00:01:25.738 --> 00:01:29.788
instead of it being in the app delegate
like it was in my favorite movies.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:33.008
And if we scroll to the bottom,
we have some helper methods.

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:34.162
And at the very bottom,

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:37.408
we have a method that allows us to
use this client like a singleton.

00:01:37.408 --> 00:01:41.334
So, in a very similar way as to
how we use the AppDelegate in

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:42.788
My Favorite Movies.

00:01:42.788 --> 00:01:46.596
Now these two empty methods at
the top called taskForGETMethod and

00:01:46.596 --> 00:01:48.280
taskForPostMethod.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.570
The purpose of these methods is to
reduce the common code in our request

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.560
and you've probably noticed that
there's a lot of common code between

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.150
each network request
that we've been making.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.332
We also have this
TMDBConvenience.swift file,

00:02:01.332 --> 00:02:03.914
which you'll be adding code to as well.

00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:06.099
Now let's look at the View,

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:10.574
it contains a single file
called Borderdbutton.swift.

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:13.430
Now some of you may be thinking,
what gives?

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.050
Shouldn't this folder
contain our storyboards and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.240
media files since they are what
the user sees, they are the View.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.789
Well, you could do it that way and
it's really up to you, but

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.480
we've decided to keep our NBC
folder split and organization or

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.164
we're just focusing on the SWF files and
not the other associated media files.

00:02:32.164 --> 00:02:35.820
Our reasoning for this is because
most of the actual view classes

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.168
have already been built by Apple and
are packaged together inside of UIKit.

00:02:40.168 --> 00:02:44.310
And in that way, we've decided that
this View folder over here should only

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.608
contain custom code of ours
that is purely view-related.

00:02:47.608 --> 00:02:52.184
So in this case, the only custom UI code
that we have is this BorderedButton.

00:02:52.184 --> 00:02:54.464
Finally, let's talk
about the controllers.

00:02:54.464 --> 00:02:57.961
This folder contains classes that
touch a little bit of the view and

00:02:57.961 --> 00:02:59.344
a little bit of our model.

00:02:59.344 --> 00:03:01.344
I'll start with the loginViewController.

00:03:01.344 --> 00:03:04.436
This class is a prime candidate for
why our previous app,

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:07.700
My Favorite Movies was so
poorly designed.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.832
In this controller, we have four methods
for the four different steps that

00:03:11.832 --> 00:03:15.114
are require for the movie
databases authorization flow and

00:03:15.114 --> 00:03:18.457
you'll note that the log in with
token uses the new step to A,

00:03:18.457 --> 00:03:20.974
which we're going to
cover more detail later.

00:03:20.974 --> 00:03:25.514
But we have the getRequestToken,
then loginWithToken, which is step two.

00:03:25.514 --> 00:03:29.941
GetSessionID and then the user ID isn't
really part of the authorization flow,

00:03:29.941 --> 00:03:32.607
but we get the user ID ahead of time,
so that we can

00:03:32.607 --> 00:03:36.474
use it with requests like adding and
removing movies from favorites.

00:03:36.474 --> 00:03:40.234
Now each of these methods,
let me blow one of them out right here.

00:03:40.234 --> 00:03:43.018
Each of these methods has
a lot of duplicate code and

00:03:43.018 --> 00:03:46.074
they make this controller
a really big and heavy class.

00:03:46.074 --> 00:03:48.314
I think, let's see,
we're at 340 lines right now.

00:03:48.314 --> 00:03:51.434
So, it's starting to get pretty large.

00:03:51.434 --> 00:03:55.481
But what's worse is that if want to add
more complexity, this controller is

00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:59.354
just going to keep growing and growing
and become really hard to deal with.

00:03:59.354 --> 00:04:02.849
And when you have big files like
this and lots of duplicate code,

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.674
then you know you have problems.

00:04:04.674 --> 00:04:09.183
What we should be thinking about is
how we make our code light, clean and

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:12.350
reuseable not overly complex and
hard to manage?

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.310
For our apps, a great way to fix
this problem is to always keep our

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.700
view controller small by
migrating a logic like this,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.430
this networking code
away into the model.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.480
So for this application,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.530
we're going to take the code that's
in this login view controller and

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.730
move it into the model or into the movie
database client, this TMDB client.
