So, since we know that we are trying to write an equation and not just an

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.996
expression,I am going to start off by writing a equals in our box down here. So,

00:00:07.084 --> 00:00:10.608
since I know that the left side of the equation is not going to change at all.

00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:14.322
Then I can start to combine my like terms. Conveniently, our terms with w are

00:00:14.334 --> 00:00:18.330
already written next to each other and our terms with n. It was so nice that we

00:00:18.342 --> 00:00:22.905
did that for ourselves earlier. This is pretty straightforward then. Since these

00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:26.920
are like terms, I can just add their coefficients. 36 plus 51 is 87. And I

00:00:26.932 --> 00:00:31.150
multiply that by the variable w. 22 plus 50 is 72. And that gets multiplied by

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:32.894
the variable as well. Awesome.

00:00:32.897 --> 00:00:36.980
We're one step closer to helping Grant figure out how much money he's going to

00:00:36.992 --> 00:00:38.762
have after these first two batches of friends pay him.
