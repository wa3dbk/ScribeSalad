00:00:01.884 --> 00:00:04.763
Do you have an example of using
a linear layout in your app?

00:00:04.763 --> 00:00:10.611
&gt;&gt; Well, even here, this cluster
of three cards is a horizontal

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:16.463
linear layout where we just add
child views like three cards.

00:00:16.463 --> 00:00:23.810
And then we set layout width to
zero dp and layout weight to one.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.569
And essentially, it instructs
the linear layout to take however much

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:35.523
weight it has at run time and distribute
it evenly based on other relative

00:00:35.523 --> 00:00:42.100
weights are distributed evenly between
all the child views in that group.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.160
So that's one example.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.420
And another example would be over here,
that you have new and updated games.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.110
And the more button which
is a cluster header,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.910
it's also a simple
horizontal linear layout.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.980
So when things are simple,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.740
you don't necessarily want to
start writing custom layouts.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.310
Don't just use relative
layout everywhere

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.980
because it's more versatile
than linear layout for example.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.700
That's just overkill for simpler things.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.748
&gt;&gt; So when a designer gives you a mock,

00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:15.660
how do you go about
starting to build that app?

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.660
&gt;&gt; So hopefully at that point, like
we talked, we have not just one mock.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.640
But rather, at least two or
three that show how

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.880
the design scales between small
screens and large screens.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.560
And then I want to
identify building blocks.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.680
So, if we talk about sometime like
a card which appears in a lot of places

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.000
in the app,
I wouldn't want necessarily to start

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.740
implementing a lot of
variants of the same card.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.240
Based on if it needs to show
a small image or a big image or

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.930
maybe show a one line title,
instead of two line titles.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.258
So I'm trying to identify these
blocks and implement them as

00:01:57.258 --> 00:02:02.580
stand-alone classes, stand-alone layouts
and then start building on top of those.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.484
So you start from text view,
image view, spinner,

00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:11.055
and whatnot to build smaller blocks.

00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:16.771
And then hopefully you're able to
keep on taking those small blocks and

00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:22.450
build larger blocks while reusing
the same basic set of blocks.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.390
And what's nice about it is even though
you spend maybe a little bit more time

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.440
up front, it becomes easier especially
if the design is consistent

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.280
in how it applies its language to
evolve the app and to add new features.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.472
If the design is consistent, then you
keep on seeing the same blocks being

00:02:41.472 --> 00:02:44.461
used in different
configurations again and again.

00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:49.789
And then that's where your initial
investment starts paying off where

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:55.430
you don't treat implementation of
a new screen as a brand new thing.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.190
But rather, maybe 50, 60, 70, however
much percent is already there, maybe

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.450
it needs a little bit tweaking with
color, so maybe typography or whatnot.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.272
But hopefully, if the design is
consistent, then the implementation is

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:14.098
also easier to move forward if
you already built for that.

00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:19.903
And it also becomes easier to apply
redesign, just on the visual level.

00:03:19.903 --> 00:03:24.099
If you want to tweak colors,
if you want to tweak typography,

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.941
if you want to add maybe like we did
in Lollipop where you have this ripple

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:31.880
effect when you press something.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.870
If you have a few pieces that you keep
on reusing, your styles, your layouts,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.250
then you do that visual
refresh in a fewer

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.030
number of places and then hopefully they
get applied consistently everywhere.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.550
So for me I want to place the focus at
the beginning on getting the data right,

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.918
especially for an app that is getting
its data from external sources.

00:03:57.918 --> 00:04:02.512
And then do closer to the pixels,
refine the pixels once you have

00:04:02.512 --> 00:04:07.532
the data to do the grid, to do
the typography, colors, animations,

00:04:07.532 --> 00:04:12.575
transitions, whatnot however much
time you have to spend on that,.

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:16.338
And I think it would be the same if you
had something like a Twitter client.

00:04:16.338 --> 00:04:21.991
You could start by pixel-perfecting
your layouts with some fake data.

00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:27.122
And then you discover that you know
nothing about fetching the data from

00:04:27.122 --> 00:04:32.920
Twitter, and it takes you the next
three months just to fetch the data.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.240
Or, just an example, so
I prefer to start from the data.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.880
I think about this as an iceberg where
you see the pretty pixels as maybe 5%,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.640
10% of above the surface, and
then there's a lot of work going

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.800
below the surface,
if you will, to support that.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.820
&gt;&gt; You mentioned the tip of
the iceberg is what people see.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.210
So what exactly is going
on below the surface?

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.620
How do you see the Google Play App?

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.940
&gt;&gt; So what happens below the surface
is first of all to get the data from

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.643
the network, so you can authenticate
to be on a server and get the data.

00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:13.969
And then maybe to cache it locally so

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.152
that the next time you go from
the stream into the details page and

00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:22.820
back into the stream, we should be
using cached data, cached images.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.616
So that we don't put too
much strain on the battery.

00:05:26.616 --> 00:05:30.284
And also the app already shows
the information that it has.

00:05:30.284 --> 00:05:33.830
Then you have support
from multiple accounts.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.660
Then you have maybe persisting a few
bits here and there in the database.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.380
Then we have the billing flows,
which is, most of that

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.840
work is done on the server to integrate
with different payment methods.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.200
And then there's the work
on the client as well.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.050
And another big part of the Play
store is downloading and

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.660
installing apps and games.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.530
We are, on the Play store side,
we are in charge of downloading,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.840
installing, updating apps.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.556
And so that's another big chunk of,
once again, pretty much all of

00:06:11.556 --> 00:06:16.052
these have their surface bits,
which are pixels on the screen.

00:06:16.052 --> 00:06:21.425
And then there's a lot of work
going below the surface to bring

00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:27.668
that information for the right account,
and to put that on the screen.

00:06:27.668 --> 00:06:32.610
&gt;&gt; It's clear that you've worked on many
different iterations of Google Play app.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.385
How do you keep up to date with
the latest news in Android?

00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:42.657
&gt;&gt; There's a lot of information
on Google+ from very active

00:06:42.657 --> 00:06:47.295
Android developers who put
out a lot of tutorials.

00:06:47.295 --> 00:06:52.322
And, Just

00:06:52.322 --> 00:06:57.575
from different blogs, and
sometimes I don't necessarily go and

00:06:57.575 --> 00:07:02.732
read deeply a certain series about
recycler view or a view page or

00:07:02.732 --> 00:07:07.430
what-not or how to configure
the tool bar and action bar.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.200
I kind of try to put it like

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.810
that I know that there's a lot
of information in there.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.340
And then when I do need that
deep level of information,

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.130
then I go to those resources.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.960
&gt;&gt; Well thank you so
much for your time, Cyril.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.110
I think our students will really
enjoy hearing your perspective on

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.010
what it's like to be
an Android app engineer.
