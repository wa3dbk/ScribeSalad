00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now the other thing is that in a resegmented market and again we use Southwest

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
as a low-cost entry or whole foods as a unique niche supplier via positioning

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and what you really want to start asking is what factors can you eliminate that your industry

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
has long competed on or what can you reduce below the industry standard

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or raise above the industry standard or what can be created that the industry has never offered?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now what's interesting is if you look at the chasm between your early adopters,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
your early evangelists and the mainstream market in a resegmented market

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
this is what Moore was kind of talking about called the chasm.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There really is a gap between what these people want and a gap between their needs.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And if you're not careful your sales curve well it would start looking like this over here

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and actually might collapse until the mainstream adopts.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So let's take a look at what a sales curve might look like in a resegmented market.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And it's a complex sales growth chart because in the first couple of years

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
you're just kind of getting the spillover of people who kind of think you're just

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
a competitor in the existing market and your sales will kind of toddle along until if you're correct

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and you were right about that niche or low-cost segmentation

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
you will start seeing an exponential increase in sales.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And if you're wrong, well you'll just kind of be one of the many competitors

00:01:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
in an existing market.
