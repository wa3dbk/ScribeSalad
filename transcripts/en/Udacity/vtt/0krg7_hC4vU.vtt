00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:04.580
Negative 2 and 5 are correct. This equation doesn't need to be rearranged. We

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.274
just want to find factors of negative 10 at sum to negative 3. Negative 5 and 2

00:00:09.274 --> 00:00:14.014
are the factor pair we need. We write our factors, set each one equal to zero

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:19.025
and solve for m. So, m could equal 5 or m could equal negative 2. And remember,

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:23.636
we can always check our answers. We can plug each answer into the original

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:29.240
equation to check. I get true statements in the end, so yes, 5 and negative 2

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.333
are correct.
