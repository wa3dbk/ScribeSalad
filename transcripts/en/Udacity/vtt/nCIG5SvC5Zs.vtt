00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.290
Now we're ready for

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.660
the matching equivalent of
the max flow min cut theorem.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.650
The Max-MAtching/ Min
Vertex Cover Theorem.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.990
Consider a bipartite graph G and
a matching M.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.350
Then the following are equivalent.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.650
M is a maximum matching.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.240
M admits no augmenting paths and

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.210
there's a vertex cover That has the same
size as the size of the matching.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.240
The proof will be very similar
to the max flow min cut theorem.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.550
First we'll show that
if M is a max-matching,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.670
then it can't admit
any augmenting paths.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.170
Well suppose not.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.750
Then there is some augmenting path,
and if we augment M by this path,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.860
we get a larger matching, meaning that
M was not a maximum as we had supposed.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.260
Next we argue that if M
admits no augmenting paths,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.720
then there exists a vertex cover
that has the same size as M.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.100
This is the most interesting
part of the proof.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.600
We'll let H be the set of vertices
reachable via an alternating path

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.630
from unmatched vertices in L.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.870
We can visualize this definition by
starting with some unmatched vertices in

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.870
L, then following its outgoing
edges to some elements in R, and

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.380
then following all the matched edges
back to matched elements of L,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.510
and back and forth and so
forth, as many times as we can.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.490
Note that because the matching
doesn't admit any augmenting paths,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.070
all of these paths must terminate in
some matched vertex on the L side.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.690
Let's draw the rest of
the graph here as well.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.860
We have some matched vertices in L, the
vertices of R that they're matched to,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.700
And possibly some unmatched
vertices in R as well.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.960
Note that H and the compliment of
H correspond to the minimum cut

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.800
that we used when discussing
the max-flow min-cut theorem.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.000
To get a min vertex cover,
we select the part of H that is in R and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.990
the part of L that is not,
and we call this set S.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.530
S contains exactly one
vertex of each edge in M.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.210
If the edge in M happens to belong to H,
then we've got its right side.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.850
And if it doesn't belong to H,
then we got its left side.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.910
So the size of S and
the size of M must be the same.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.160
Next, we need to convince ourselves
that S is really a vertex cover.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.910
Remember that there are no edges
internal to R or internal to L, so

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.280
we don't need to worry about those.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.130
The part of S that is in R covers
all the edges internal to our H

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.440
set of vertices, and
these over here in L,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.750
they cover all edges in
the not H part of the graph.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.600
So what we really need to worry about
are just edges that go across the cut.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.370
Well, from here to here,
both vertices in the edge are covered.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.690
So we really only need to worry
about the part of L that is in H

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.090
being one vertex, and the part of R
that is not in H being the other.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.490
But if there were such an edge,
crossing here.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.710
It would have been in H,
because we would have been going from

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.850
a vertex in H via
an unmatched edge to R.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.200
We conclude there are no such edges,
and hence S is a vertex cover.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.260
Finally we have to prove that
the existence of a vertex cover

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.180
that is the same size as a matching,
implies that the matching is a maximum.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.300
And this follows immediately from
our discussion that a vertex cover

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.030
is an upper bound on
the size of a matching.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.250
So if it wasn't a maximum matching, then
the whole idea of vertex cover wouldn't

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.580
be an upper bound, as we argued already.
