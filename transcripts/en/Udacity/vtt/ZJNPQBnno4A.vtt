00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.029
Now despite all of these benefits, we've yet

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:06.040
to see a significant deployment of IPv6. Here you

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.730
can see the number of routing table entries

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.630
for IPv6 routes, as well as the growth over

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.090
time from 2004. To the end of 2013. What's remarkable

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.030
is that we only see 16,000 IPv6 routes in the global routing table. This

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.840
is not that many considering that there are about 500,000

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.410
IPv4 routes in the global routing table. The problem is that IPv6 is very

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.020
hard to deploy incrementally. Remember our discussion

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.170
of the narrow waste. Everything runs over

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.930
IPv4 and IPv4 was designed to run over a variety of physical layers. This

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.520
common protocol has allowed tremendous growth, but

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.270
because. Everything depends on the narrow waste

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.630
of IPv4 and, because IPv4 is built on top of so many

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.020
other types of infrastructure, changing it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.209
becomes extremely tricky incremental deployment where part

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:09.780
of the internet is running IPv4 and other parts have been upgraded to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.960
IPv6. Results in significant incompatiability. There

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.060
are various incremental deployment options for IPv6.
