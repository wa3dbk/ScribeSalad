00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.172
We start our problem by multiplying by the reciprocal of our second fraction. We

00:00:04.172 --> 00:00:08.900
flip it over. We can factor this first numerator as 5x plus 3 times 5x minus 3,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.703
since this is the difference of two perfect squares. Our denominator is also a

00:00:13.703 --> 00:00:19.312
difference of two perfect squares. So we have 2x plus 3 times 2x minus 3. For

00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:24.196
this fraction, we can factor this numerator by finding the factors of negative

00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:29.310
18 that sum to negative 7. Those factors are negative 9 and positive 2. We use

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.790
factoring by grouping to get 3x plus 1 times 2x minus 3 for this first

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.822
numerator. And finally, for this denominator we find factors of positive 45 that

00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:44.630
sum to negative 14. Those two factors are negative 9 and negative 5. These

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.934
factors let us rewrite our middle term, and then we can use factoring by

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:53.104
grouping. We get a denominator of 5x minus 3 times 3x minus 1. Now that we have

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:57.545
all of our factors, let's cancel factors that simplify to 1. These two factors

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:02.160
would reduce to 1, and these two factors would also reduce to 1, leaving us with

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.474
these factors for our answer. You're doing amazing at dividing rational

00:01:06.474 --> 00:01:09.703
expressions and factoring if you got this one correct.
