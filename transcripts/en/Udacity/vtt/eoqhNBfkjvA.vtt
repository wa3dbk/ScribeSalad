00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.936
At this point, you should have a pretty good sense of what the various

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:06.635
transforms do. Three.js supports these basic transforms without you needing to

00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:10.170
understand what's going on inside the code. However, three.js can't provide

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.780
every possible type of transform out there. Though it tries. More importantly,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.119
you'll need to know more about how transforms are coded if you want to program

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.548
the vertex and pixel shaders in the pipeline. Here's a screenshot of the

00:00:20.548 --> 00:00:25.662
contents of the forearm object 3D from the robot arm demo. Using the debugger.

00:00:25.662 --> 00:00:29.156
You have been using the debugger in your browser, right? If not, please go look

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:32.764
at the additional course materials right now and learn more about it. If you dig

00:00:32.764 --> 00:00:37.384
inside any object 3D, you'll see a parameter called matrix. It is a Matrix4 with

00:00:37.384 --> 00:00:41.192
a bunch of numbers in it. Ultimately this matrix parameter is what holds the

00:00:41.192 --> 00:00:44.983
transform that changes the object's shape, orientation, and location. When you

00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:48.877
set the position, rotation, and scale these all affect what gets stored in this

00:00:48.877 --> 00:00:53.124
array. This matrix represents all these transforms put together in a tidy

00:00:53.124 --> 00:00:57.545
package. We can multiply a coordinate, represented by a pointer vector, by this

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:01.396
matrix and get a new coordinate. That's honestly it in a nut shell. Any object

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:05.208
we make is ultimately represented by a bunch of points. These points are in the

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:08.900
object's own sort of space. For example if we make a cube using cube geometry

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.532
it's centered around the origin. We transform the cube's points by a transfer

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:18.709
matrix to move, rotate and scale it as desired. A transform matrix is a 4 by 4

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:23.640
set of numbers. Three.js also supports a Matrix3 type which almost no one uses.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.983
In math in general a matrix can have any dimensions at all. Such as 12 by 38.

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:34.000
The 4 by 4 matrix is the size that the GPU prefers. We can multiply a coordinate

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.120
by a matrix. This is shown by putting the coordinate to the right of the matrix.

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:42.189
The new resulting coordinate is put to the left of the equals sign. The

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.130
mathematical notation is shown here. The coordinate times the matrix gives this

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.943
new coordinate. To multiply a coordinate by a matrix you take the coordinate and

00:01:52.943 --> 00:01:58.263
perform a dot product with each row of the matrix. For example the dot product

00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:03.326
of the first row and the coordinate is this, D1 equals N11 times C1 plus N21

00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:08.389
times C2 and so on the sum of these four terms is the first coordinate of the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:13.698
result. The dot product of the second row in a coordinate gives D2, the second

00:02:13.698 --> 00:02:19.573
coordinate of the result. After four dot products, you have a new coordinate.
