00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now we can handle expressions like

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
(2 + 3) or (x + 1)

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but if you think about most of the Python programs you've written,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
they've got quite a bit more going on--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
things like "if" statements or assignment statements

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that influence the state or change which parts of the program are executed.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Formally, we say that statements or program parts,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
like "if" or "while" or "return"

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
change the flow of control, and a potential

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
reasonable analogy for control flow is a river.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Here, I've written a relatively simple bit of Python code.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But we could sort of trace through it,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
noting which lines get visited.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We're definitely going to visit: x = 1.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We'll take a look at this "if"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
because (x) is 1, it's less than 5

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
so we're going to curve in here and evaluate this "print".

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But then we're going to kind of skip over

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
this whole "else" branch

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and rejoin things here--so you've got this flow

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that sometimes branches, seems to fork,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
rejoins at the end--Control Flow.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Which part of the program do we execute?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If I'm to keep my finger on the line

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that we're currently worried about, how does my finger move around?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We're going to need to handle this sort of things

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
if we're building an interpreter for JavaScript and HTML.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So things like "if", "while", and "return"

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
change the flow of control.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
These things are called "statements"

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to distinguish them from "expressions".

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Expressions are typically a bit simpler.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
They're more like noun phrases in a natural language.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
A statement is more like an entire sentence.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's going to contain a verb as well or some instruction,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
like change the value of (x)

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
or jump over here.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Statements often contain expressions

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but not the other way around.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And you can think of this as being a bit of a hierarchy.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This whole thing is a statement.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The usual abbreviation for a statement is "stmt".

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But just this little part down here is an expression--

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
just like a whole sentence may contain one or two nouns.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So let's say we have an environment that maps

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the variable, (x), to the value, 2--

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and now I've written a JavaScript program below it

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that contains an if-then-else statement--it should remind you a lot of Python.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If (x &lt; 5), the variable, (y), is going to be assigned to "don";

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
otherwise, the variable, (y), is going to be assigned "quixote".

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
In our environment, where (x) is 2,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
(x &lt; 5) will be evaluated to True.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So the flow of control will visit here

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and here, but will skip these two and rejoin us down here at the bottom.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And hopefully, at the end of the day, we'll have a new environment

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
where (x) maps to 2, and the variable (y) maps to "don".

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
"Don Quixote" is a classic novel,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
written by Miguel de Cervantes around 1605.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We get a number of expressions from it, like

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
"Tilting at windmills" , in English;

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the protagonist believes a windmill to be a mortal foe,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
perhaps a dragon, and he charges up but gets knocked down

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
by the whirling arms each time.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
These days, "tilting at windmills" means

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
trying something over and over again,

00:02:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
even though you know you're never going to succeed--an impossible task.
