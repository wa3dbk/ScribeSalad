00:00:00.018 --> 00:00:03.522
The third algorithm we'll cover today is called a histogram. Now, what's a histogram?

00:00:03.522 --> 00:00:08.508
It's a means of categorizing and usually displaying data that varies with a particular measurement.

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:12.532
In practice, to create a histogram, we take a measurement for each item in a population

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:15.484
and then place those measurements into a set of bins that we define,

00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:18.087
where each bin covers a certain range of measurements.

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:20.724
This is much easier to explain with an example.

00:00:20.724 --> 00:00:24.904
I'm recording this lecture at Udacity headquarters in Palo Alto, California.

00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:27.786
So let's say I walk out on the street in Palo Alto,

00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:32.552
and record the height of each of the next 100 adults that happen to walk by.

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:35.445
What that gets me is a list of 100 measurements.

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:37.738
Here's what that list might look like.

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:40.580
But it's difficult to draw out conclusions from such a list.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.321
Instead, what I'll do is create a histogram.

00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:50.252
I'm going to specify a number of bins, for instance, 4 bins, shorter than 150 centimeters,

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:54.383
between 150 and 165 centimeters, between 165 and 180 centimeters,

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:57.005
and taller than 180 centimeters.

00:00:57.028 --> 00:00:59.452
Then I'll place each measurement into its bin.

00:00:59.452 --> 00:01:03.057
So every time someone walks by, I place another tick mark into the bin.

00:01:03.057 --> 00:01:10.847
Here, for instance, we might end up with the measurements 12, 34, 38, 60 out of 100 people.

00:01:10.847 --> 00:01:14.261
Often in statistics you might want to plot this histogram, which might

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:17.276
give you a curve that tells you something interesting about the data.

00:01:17.283 --> 00:01:22.802
Let me introduce you to one specific operation you might want to do on a histogram of data

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:24.959
because you'll be doing this in your assignment.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:28.163
For the histogram we just showed here, we might want to compute the answer to the question

00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:32.370
"if I'm this tall, how many people are shorter than me?" for all bins in the histogram.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.345
This computation is called the cumulative distribution function on a histogram.

00:01:36.345 --> 00:01:38.743
It's also known as a definite integral.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.936
We want to compute the cumulative distribution function on this histogram.

00:01:41.957 --> 00:01:47.484
The input of the histogram is an array of values, for instance, 12, 34, 38, 16.

00:01:47.498 --> 00:01:51.263
In 1 word, or 2 words, to be a little more precise,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.108
what is the operation we need to do to this input

00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:57.011
to get the cumulative distribution function?
