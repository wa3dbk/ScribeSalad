00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So welcome back to statistics 101. Today, we're going to learn something insanely cool.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You might remember from the very beginning of this class that we had

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
data sets that involve more than one dimension.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
For example, the size of a house is relative to its price, and initially, we talked about scatter plots,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we talked about bar charts but we didn't talk about what's the holy grail of statistics,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and that is fitting a line through the data points.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
After this unit, you'll be able to fit a line to data points like those

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and you'll even be able to tell me what the residual error is in that fit, and that allows us

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
not just to understand the data but also to make predictions about points we've never seen before.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So let's dive straight in--so let's talk about lines and let's talk about the technology

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to fit lines to data called linear regression.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It has two dimensional data such as the age of a person

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and the person's income and this is obviously made up data.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Then linear regression tries to fit a line that best describes the data.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So how do we specify a line--suppose we call the horizontal x as x

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and suppose we call the vertical axis y then the lines commonly described

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
with a functional relationship between x and y of the following form y=bx+a.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So let us look at lines. Let's take this simple example y=2x.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Let's add units to the axes of coordinate system and let me draw 3 different examples of lines.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The blue line, the green line, and the red line and for this example y=2x.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Can you imagine which of the three lines would be described for this equation.

00:01:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check one of these three boxes.
