00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.592
This is how the problem was set up for you. We have an array of elements, and

00:00:03.592 --> 00:00:07.954
your job was to swap the first and the second half. I then move the j'th

00:00:07.954 --> 00:00:15.157
position to the i'th position and then take the saved value in here. If

00:00:15.157 --> 00:00:15.551
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:18.495
has reminded you how to swap two elements in an array, we've actually seen the

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:22.253
same thing with array lists before. Let's go through this really quickly so

00:00:22.253 --> 00:00:26.206
that you understand this. So we want to swap these two positions. And in the

00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:29.638
second line, it moves the j element into the i element thereby overwriting what

00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:35.038
was in here. But fortunately in the first line we had moved that into the

00:00:35.038 --> 00:00:40.564
variable saved. And then in the third line, we move it into j. Now we're ready

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:44.850
to apply the pseudo code that you've seen at the end of the previous unit.
