00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.510
Here's the equation we found. I'm going to rewrite this equation by dividing by

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:08.835
2. I'm going to just change what it looks like. Notice, if I divide both sides

00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:13.195
of the equation by 2, I need to be careful on this side. I need to take the 2

00:00:13.207 --> 00:00:17.600
and divide it into each term, both the 2l and the 2w. I get p divided by 2

00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:22.384
equals l plus w. This p divided by 2 might look funny. But we know dividing by a

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:27.161
number is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. So, I can rewrite this as p

00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:31.870
times 1 half. So, I have p times one half. This should connect to your drawing.

00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:36.221
I know if I go half way around the parameter I should only be at l plus w.

00:00:36.382 --> 00:00:40.858
Notice, it is l plus w, that's half way around the rectangle. We know the

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.761
perimeter of the rectangle is 52 feet so I am going to write that here. The

00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:50.420
length of the rectangle is 6 feet more than the width. So, I can write the

00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:55.725
length being equal to w plus 6. The length is 6 more than the width. Now, we can

00:00:55.737 --> 00:01:01.215
make a substitution. Wherever I see the letter l, I can replace it with w plus

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:06.620
6. And wherever I see the letter p, I can replace it with 52 feet. We have a

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:11.870
half times 52 equals w plus 6 plus w. We made the substitution so we could work

00:01:11.882 --> 00:01:16.944
with one equation and one variable. Now, we can actually solve for this one

00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:21.401
variable. I'm going to leave that up to you. Enter the width here and the length

00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:25.207
here. And don't worry about writing units, I've got those for you.
