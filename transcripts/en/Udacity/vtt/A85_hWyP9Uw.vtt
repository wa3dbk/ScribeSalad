00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.410
Let's do an example of direct-mapped
caches and how they're accessed.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.000
Here is a direct-mapped
cache with eight lines,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.760
each of which is 32 bytes in size.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.850
The processor produces the following
sequence of accesses, one at a time.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:23.910
3F1F hex, 3F2F hex, 3F2E hex,
and 3E1F hex, in this order.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.600
The question for

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.805
you is what is the content of
the cache after these four accesses?
