00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.118
We need multiply the first fraction by x plus 6 divided by x plus 6. We know

00:00:05.118 --> 00:00:09.712
that because this denominator is missing a factor of x plus 6. If we multiply

00:00:09.712 --> 00:00:14.327
the numerator and the denominator by x plus 6, we're multiplying by a form of 1,

00:00:14.327 --> 00:00:19.084
and we changed this denominator into our lowest common denominator. For the

00:00:19.084 --> 00:00:24.248
second fraction we need to multiply by x plus 2 divided by x plus 2. This

00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:29.345
denominator is missing our factor of x plus 2 to form the LCD. If you got these

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:31.333
correct, excellent thinking.
