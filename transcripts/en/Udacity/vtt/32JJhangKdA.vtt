00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.370
Long is, is normally an adjective of some sorts, but that doesn't mean that

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.250
every adjective is going to necessarily contribute to this list of attributes.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.640
So, it's fine to have one and then discard it as not being relevant.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.470
Okay? You had single leaf, you have leaf counter.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.530
We have this one set modify sub trees. There is another,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.340
call it a trick, another way of getting modifiers that aren't directly,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.780
that don't correctly come from adjectives, and that is if you've got

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.990
a prepositional phrase, such as parts of the tree, or count of the leaves,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.930
you could think of tree parts. Okay? And leave counts and so on. So once again,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.190
the, the, the simple rule of saying adjectives doesn't quite get you all the,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.240
all the way where you want to go. So, some of the issues that arise when you,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.370
when you try this technique. Okay? As we said, parts of the tree doesn't appear.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.280
In, in the natural language to be an adjective. However we still want to

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.520
recognize that the word part signifies an attribute of tree. Same for

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.090
count of leaves. As you indicated the use of the word long even though it's,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.560
nominally a, an adjective doesn't really contribute here in the sense of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.060
being a modifier for one of these classes. The phrase single leaf,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.360
if we think about it for a minute, has to do with the count of the leaves.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.080
This is a one, of a, of a potential different number of counts that leaves

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.690
could have. That is, there's a count attribute that has a value of one.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.290
Okay, single being, single meaning one.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.550
Similar to the phrase two sub trees can be interpreted as a count of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.460
the number of a sub trees, in the tree class. Having a value of two
