00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
And the answer here is yes; player 1 can always win this game here that I gave you.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.610
And 1 strategy for player 1 to do this, for example,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.070
is to move this piece over here to here.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.100
Now it's player 2's turn, and player 1 is now threatening to win in the next move

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.040
by moving this piece here to this piece here.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.100
Now, player 2 could try and block this vertex here,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.680
but player 2 can only do this with this piece here.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.410
If player 2 were to move his or her piece over here,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.510
then player 1, in the next move could, however, move this piece here to that vertex.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.180
So no matter what player 2 does, player 1 will win in the next move

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.640
by either moving this piece here to that vertex,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.120
or being able to move this piece here to that vertex.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.250
Player 2 could also use this piece here to block this vertex down here,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.410
but that would still keep this 1 here free,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.160
and player 2 also cannot reach any of the vertices that would let player 2 win.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.730
So for this initial configuration here, player 1 can always force a win.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.160
Now, if you figured out that quiz yourself, you should be very, very proud of yourself.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.910
Asking this question: "Can player 1 force a win?"

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.550
for a given instance of Roadblock on a graph with end vertices

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.160
is provably harder than any problem in NP.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.940
Which means that this problem requires exponential time to solve,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.510
even if P were equal to NP.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.540
So even if you showed this, or had a nondeterministic gram available

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.860
to solve this problem, you would still require exponential time.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.990
And that is why Roadblock is 1 example for a game,

00:01:34.990 --> 99:59:59.000
or asking a question about a game, that is harder to solve than anything in NP.
