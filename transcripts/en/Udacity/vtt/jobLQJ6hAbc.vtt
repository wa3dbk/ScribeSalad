Nowadays, many databases
have a web front end

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.590
to allow users to create
a database using the web.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.390
The website typically offers a web
form for entering the query and

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.620
runs a program to form
the input into SQL query and

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.130
send it to the backend database server.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.020
For example,
the web application can be a PHP and

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.490
it takes user input and
forms a SQL query.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.750
The security threat here is
that the input may be malicious

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.760
that is the SQL to the database
server is malicious and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.830
can lead to compromise of data
confidentiality and integrity.
