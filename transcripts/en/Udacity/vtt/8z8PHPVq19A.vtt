00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.400
So this was a really tough question, and I'll admit I

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.340
got it wrong twice myself in trying to answer it. But I'm

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.640
pretty sure I know the correct answer now. Which is that

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.150
none of these are actually equivalent to s.find t,i. If you didn't

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.990
get that, that's okay. Two of em are pretty close, and

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.580
the two that are pretty close are the first and the third.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.350
But none of them are exactly correct and let's go through

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.580
an example to understand why. So let's suppose we started with s

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.330
as udacity. Let's make

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.110
t city and make i three.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.857
So if we do s.find t,i, what we're going to get starting

00:00:42.857 --> 00:00:48.008
from position i which is n, s looking for city, we're going to

00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:53.056
find it right there. The output of s.find

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:57.120
t,i with these variables is going to be three. So

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.600
it, search is starting from position three, but it's still

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.700
going to give us the output where that's position three. It

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.090
gives us output in terms of the positions in the

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.190
original string, s. So the first one, si:, where i

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.940
is three, is going to be this string. So when we

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.620
do the find where that's the string, we find city

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.220
at position zero, and the result of this is zero.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.780
That's not the same as the result we expect

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.570
which is three. The second one doesn't actually make

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.180
any sense. So here s.find evaluates to a number,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.890
and then we're trying to index from a number, that

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.160
doesn't make any sense. We can only index from

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.590
a string, select a sub-sequence of characters, there's no way

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.120
to select a sub-sequence of characters from a number.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.300
So this is invalid, definitely doesn't produce the same output

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.100
as s.find t,i. The third one's the trickiest one. This is one

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.590
that I originally thought would be equal and for this particular case it is. In

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.530
this case when we do s 3 colon.find t well

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.730
that's going to produce the result zero we that

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.925
we saw before. And then when we add i to

00:02:02.925 --> 00:02:05.120
it; we're going to get the value three. So in

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.350
cases where we find the string t, in s starting

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.358
from position i; this will be equivalent. If we made t something else, so let's

00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:20.742
suppose we made t dog, well then what's going to happen is the result

00:02:20.742 --> 00:02:28.600
of s.find, t,i when t is dog, that result would be negative one. Find always

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.606
returns negative one, when the string we're searching for is not found. In this

00:02:33.606 --> 00:02:36.246
case, we'd have negative one as the result for

00:02:36.246 --> 00:02:38.710
this, add i to it. That would give us the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.570
number two. That's not the same as negative one because

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.790
this also is not equivalent. In cases where t is

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.420
found, it is equivalent, but in cases where t is

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.620
not found, it's not equivalent. The fourth one is also

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.310
not equivalent. For the fourth one we're starting from selecting

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.810
the sub-sequence of s, starting from position i. And we're

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.070
looking for the string t where we sub-sequence from t starting from position i,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.960
this won't give us the same result as s.find t,i. So this was

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.420
kind of a tricky question. You are not upset if you didn't get it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.746
right but the answer is none of these are actually equivalent to s.find t,i.
