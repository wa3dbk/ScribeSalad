00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.246
Now that we factored and found our vertical asymptote, let's use long division

00:00:03.246 --> 00:00:06.333
just like we did in the last lesson, to find the horizontal asymptote of this

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:11.251
function. First though, I'm going to need to multiply the numerator out again,

00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:16.590
so that I have something in a form that I can divide with. Okay, so now I have

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.310
that T equals 0.966x squared plus 9.66x divided by 11x plus 50. Let's use long

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.270
division to carry out this division that we see in the fraction. So here I've

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.665
written out our division in long division form. If we solve this long division

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:36.655
problem, what is the first term of our answer going to look like? Is it going

00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:42.420
to be some coefficient times x. Will it be a constant? Will it be a fraction

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.116
with a denominator of 11x plus 50? Or, will it not be anything because you

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:49.549
refuse to do anymore long division at all.
