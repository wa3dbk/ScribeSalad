00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So just as we applied memoization to Fibonacci,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we're going to apply memoization to our attempts to parse a grammar.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When we were trying to compute Fibonacci, the Nth position in the chart

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
corresponded to the Nth Fibonacci number.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's say I'm trying to parse a string made out of a big list of tokens--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
token 1, token 2, token N, all the way up to token last.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We're going to try to figure out the string 1 token at a time.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So the Nth position in the chart is going to be all the parse states we could be in

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
after seeing the first N tokens--the first N words--in the input.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This means that instead of our chart returning a single number,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
our chart is going to return a set or list, an entire collection.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Here's a much simpler grammar to try out this concept on.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
E goes to E + E or E goes to INT. We use INT like we use NUM or number.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It represents integer.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So here the language of our grammar includes things like INT + INI, INT + INT + INT.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Suppose, in fact, that the input is INT + INT.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm going to draw out a chart showing N and chart of N.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Suppose we haven't seen any of the input yet. Where could we be?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Well, conceptually my finger is going to have to be very far to the left.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I could be looking for E + E, or I could be looking for INT,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but regardless, I haven't seen any of it left.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
There's nothing in my past, and the whole world is in the future.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The reason I can't be sure yet is that I've only seen 0 tokens of the input.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So even though we, the viewers at home, the studio audience,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
know that eventually we're going to be using this top rule,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
our chart hasn't seen enough of the input yet to make that determination.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Well, after seeing only 1 token, we've seen the INT.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
One possible state I could be in is, well, I'm trying to reduce an expression to an integer.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You gave me an integer. I'm done.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
If I think the input is going to go on a little longer,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I might expect to see a + and an E coming up later.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So this is the second state that I could be in.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
If I've seen the INT and the +, then among other things, my world probably looks like this.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I've got an E and a + in my past. I'm looking for an E in my future.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
There might be a few other elements in this state, and we might continue the chart

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
a bit farther to the right, but this is the basic idea.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's just like our chart for Fibonacci, but instead of holding a single number,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
it holds a list or a sequence of parsing states, and each parsing state is a rule in our grammar

00:02:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
augmented with a single red dot somewhere on the right-hand side.
