00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To apply stimulation in real life and to apply optimization in real life,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we have to have an idea about the sources and the amounts of errors that we are introducing.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The model as such may not be good enough.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
For instance, we may be missing some vital effects in that model.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The values that we are using for the model's parameters may be wrong.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We may be using the wrong growth rate or we may be using the growth rate that's too big

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
or we may be using a maximum carrying capacity that's too large.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The initial data may be off. Do we really know the amount of fish we're starting with?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And we may have numerical issues, maybe due to round off errors

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
or maybe, which is more probable, due to finite step sizes.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We look at numerics in Units 2 and 3.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'll discuss the problems with this model at the end of these units.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What I want to consider now is how to study errors concerning the parameters and initial data.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The nice thing about these is that we can check them in the model.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We can use a computer to get an idea about the effects

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
at least of errors we are introducing here,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and the computer can help us to find out which of these parameters and initial data

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
is the most critical concerning its range of uncertainty.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If we try to get more certain data, which of these would we try to improve?

00:01:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's one of the major objectives of sensitivity analysis.
