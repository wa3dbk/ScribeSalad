00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.980
Alright, so what does this have to

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.170
do with function approximation or regression. So

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.850
how does this notion of regression of falling back toward the mean have to do

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.290
with this idea of approximating functions, mapping

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.120
inputs to outputs, it seems kind of odd.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.970
So it turns out that the relationship

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.890
is, here's the, here's the connection between them.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.460
I'm going to draw a graph and on this axis

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.550
will be the parent height. And on this axis

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.460
will be the average child height. So if we

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.470
plot these against each other, let's let me put

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.020
the mean up here. Let's say that this is

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.918
mean height for the population. And now say that

00:00:38.918 --> 00:00:40.770
you know pair, we sort of imagine that parents

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.210
of average height will have children of average height.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.580
But parents that are really tall, like that

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.750
hypothetical person from before, will have children that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.610
are taller than average but not as tall

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.470
as themselves. And similarly people that are very

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.640
let's say of smaller stature will have children

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.680
that are also you know short. And, but

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.500
not quite as short again closer to the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.460
mean. And it turns out that you have this,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.144
this very nice linear relationship between these quantities, and, there's an

00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:20.210
important aspect to this. Which is that the slope of this

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.520
line is less than one, it's two thirds. Right. If the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.650
slope of this line was one, what would that mean Charles?

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.150
&gt;&gt; That would mean that everybody's children had

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.360
the, would, the same height of their parents.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.770
&gt;&gt; Right, right, and so that's exactly right, and so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.570
but if this slope is less than one, like it is,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.920
it turns out to be in, in real populations. Then what's happening is the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.490
children are little shorter than the parents.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.786
Children of taller parents are shorter than they

00:01:43.786 --> 00:01:47.235
are. And the children of short parents are taller than they are. And that's the

00:01:47.235 --> 00:01:51.130
fact that this is less than one is what makes it regression to the mean.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.692
Now this, this was worked out in I believe in

00:01:57.692 --> 00:02:00.464
the late 1800s and it was just such a beautiful

00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:04.320
way of connecting all these different quantities together. To kind of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.570
think of them as being related in this functional way.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.508
That people said, oh this is really great. I'm going to

00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:12.430
use this idea of regression. And what they started to

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.330
mean actually was this not this idea of regression to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.410
the mean. But this idea of finding a, a mathematical

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.560
relationship based on a bunch of measurements of points. So this term ended up

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.600
getting misused. But that's the term that we have now. So regression now refers

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.470
to not this idea of collapsing back towards, towards the mean, but, the idea of

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.000
using functional form to approximate a bunch of data points. Isn't that weird.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.360
&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.850
&gt;&gt; There's another example of this sort of idea where where a reasonable

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.250
word, like, like regression which we're referring to some physical thing

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.290
in the, in the world due to experiments like psych experiments at

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.270
this point became this mathematical concept where the name doesn't really

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.490
fit anymore, like there isn't really anything regressing in what we're doing.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.331
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:59.331 --> 00:03:00.910
&gt;&gt; There's another, really important example

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.750
that we're going to get to the later

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.540
in the course. Do you, do you know what I'm thinking of Charles?

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.300
&gt;&gt; No.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.490
&gt;&gt; So reinforcement learning is my field

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.970
of study. And often your field of study.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.640
&gt;&gt; Often.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.890
&gt;&gt; Often.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.380
And it turns out that reinforcement learning doesn't mean what

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.540
the words mean anymore. That this was a concept that

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.130
the psychologist used to explain what they were observing. And

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.580
then some mathematicians, well let's call them computer scientists, took

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.970
the word themselves, started to use it and used it

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.180
wrong, but now it stuck. [LAUGH] And regression is another

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.870
example like that. They, the word is sort of being

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.750
used wrong, but it stuck and that's what we're going to use.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.950
&gt;&gt; This explains why every time I have a conversation

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.170
with a psychologist about reinforcement learning, we talk past each other.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.850
&gt;&gt; Yes, they get very confused. I tried it to tell them upfront that's not

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.290
really what I mean, but I'm going to use

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.310
the words anyway, but it still confuses them.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.810
&gt;&gt; Hmm.
