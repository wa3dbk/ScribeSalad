00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.418
You will immediately notice that there's a lot of

00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:08.006
similarity between the Tournament algorithm and the the sensor

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:12.298
verse, interversing tree algorithm and also similarity to the

00:00:12.298 --> 00:00:15.409
[UNKNOWN] algorithm. So let's talk about the difference between

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:17.940
the tree barrier and the tournament barrier first. So

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.470
the, the, the main difference is that in the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.850
tournament barrier, the spin locations are statically determined, whereas

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.730
in the tree barrier we saw that the spin locations

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.770
are dynamically determined based on who arrives

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.520
at a particular node in the barrier,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.930
in the tree in that algorithm. And what that means in the tournament barrier is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.560
that we can statically assign. The spin

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.300
location for the processes at every round

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.680
of the tournament. Another important difference between

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.800
the tournament barrier and the the tree barrier,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.080
is that there is no need for a fetch

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.290
and free operation. Because all that's happening at every

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.640
level. At every round of the tournament, there is

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.450
spinning happening. And what is spinning? Basically reading. And

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.180
there is the signaling happening, what is this? This

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.940
is just writing. So, so long as we have

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.460
atomic read and write operations in the multi-processor, that's

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.978
all we need in order to implement the tournament barrier.

00:01:15.978 --> 00:01:19.350
Whereas uh, if you recall in the tree barrier

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.470
we need fetch and free operation in order to atomically

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.410
decrement the count variable. So that doesn't exist in

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.170
the tournament barrier. That's, that's another good use. Now what

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.530
about the total amount of communication that is needed.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.630
Well, it's exactly similar because of the tree arrangement. As

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.160
you go up the tree the amount of communication that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.520
happens is going to decrease. Because the tree is getting pruned

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.870
as you go towards the root of the tree and

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.010
so the amount of communication in the tournament barrier in

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.250
terms of all the notation is exactly similar to the

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.720
tree barrier it is older, login. That's the amount of communication

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.050
that is needed. Now the other important thing that that

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.670
I should mention is that at every round of the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.690
tournament you can see that there, there's quite a bit

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.250
of communication happening. In the first round going up the tree,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.600
P1 is communicating with P0, P3 with P2 and so on. All of these red arrows. Are

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.770
parallel communications that potentially take advantage of any

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.670
inherent parallelism that exists in the interconnection network. So

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.800
that's good news. That, that all of this

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.020
communication can happen in parallel if the interconnection network

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.450
allows that kind of parallelism. That can be exploited.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.410
And the, the other important point that I want

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.830
you notice is that the tournament barrier works even

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.590
if the processor is not a shared-memory machine. Because

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.030
all that we're showing here is a message communication.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.600
So P1, P0 is waiting for a message from

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.190
P1, and so on. So all of these arrows you can think of them as messages. And so

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.740
even if the processor the multiprocessor is a cluster,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.690
well by a cluster what I mean is a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.220
set of processes in which the only way

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.380
they can communicate with one another is through

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.980
message passing. There is no shared memory, no

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.525
physical shared memory. And even in that situation the,

00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:10.410
the tournament barrier will work perfectly fine to

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.484
implement the barrier algorithm. Now let's make a comparison

00:03:14.484 --> 00:03:18.540
of tournament to to NCS. Now because this

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.290
tournament is arranged as a tournament there are only

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.940
two processes involved in this communication at any

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.050
point of time in the parallel. So it means

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.650
that it cannot exploit the spatial locality that

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.830
may be there in the caches. If you recall,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.050
one of the virtues of the NCS algorithm

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.710
is that it could exploit spatial locality. And that

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.730
is, multiple spin variables could be located in

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.590
the same cache line and, and the, the parent

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.660
for instance could spin on a spin location

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.730
to which multiple children are going to come and indicate

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.244
that they are done. That's not possible in the,

00:03:56.244 --> 00:03:58.780
the tournament barrier because it is arranged as a

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.510
tournament where there are two players playing against

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.820
each other in every match. Similar to MCS, Tournament

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.590
Barrier does not need a fetch and fee operation,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.080
so that's good. A common good property of both

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.580
MCS and Tournament. The other important thing what tournament

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.600
has an edge over MCS is the fact that tournament

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.970
barrier works even if the processors are in a

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.090
cluster. Meaning, it's not a shared memory machine and is

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.320
only a cluster machine where only message passing is

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.143
really good communicator to one another. Even in [INAUDIBLE] that

00:04:32.143 --> 00:04:35.470
situation, you can implement the tournament barrier. So that's, another

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.140
good thing. Now is a good time for me to

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.440
mention to you. I've been using the word cluster what that means is that the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.850
set of nodes in the multiprocessor they don't

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.920
physically share memory and the only way they

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.900
can communicate with one another is through

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.930
message passing. And is important for you to

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.730
know this particular terminology cluster because clusters become

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.730
the work horses for data intensive computing today.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.130
The data centers and content distribution networks we're

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.860
going to see a lot of that when we

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.840
talk about giant skin services later on in

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.660
this course, and those environments, they all use this

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.670
kind of a, a, a computation cluster. And

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.260
these computation clusters employ on the order of thousands

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.050
or 10000 nodes connected together through an interconnected

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.390
network and they can operate as a parallel machine

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.610
with only message passing as the vehicle for communication among the processes.
