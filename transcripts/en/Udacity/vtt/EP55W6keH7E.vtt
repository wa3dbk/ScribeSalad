00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.560
So here's a typical group of friends in middle

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.450
school. And some of the people are popular, some of

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.050
them might not be. The first step to deciding

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.290
who's popular, is looking at who has a lot of

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.070
friends. So let's draw in some links, that show

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.290
who's a friend. And friendship links are one directional. Just

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.020
because Alice's friends with Bob, doesn't mean that Bob

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.910
is friend with Alice. So we'll draw our links as

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.040
arrows, so this means this person, we'll call him Bob, is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.560
friends with Alice. And let's say, Alice

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.320
has many friends. And let's say Bob is also friends with

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.680
this person, they're friends with each other.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.270
We have lots of friendship links. Some

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.600
of them are bi-directional but not all of them. So, we have lots of friendships.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.680
So, is this enough to decide who's popular. So, if you

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.620
went to a school like I did, it's not. Just having a

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.730
lot of friends is not enough to make you popular, you

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.860
have to have the right friends. You have to be friends with

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.510
the popular people. So, it's not enough to have lots of

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.710
geeky friends say in high school, you've gotta have lots of friends

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.580
that are popular. So that means the definition of popular, isn't

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.690
just about having lots of friends, it's about having lots of friends,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.970
who also have lots of friends. That's what

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.800
make some one popular, so we can define

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.600
popularity of a person is the number of

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.470
people who are friends with p. This means

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.100
the number of links from someone else to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.288
that person is their popularity score. So here

00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:37.456
is Charlie, so there are one, two, three

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:41.856
links into Charlie, so Charlie's popularity score would

00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:45.030
be three. Alice also has three links, so her

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.270
popularity score would also be three. Bob only has one

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.435
arrow going to Bob, so his popularity score would be

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:53.730
one. So, this isn't a bad way to define popularity,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.480
but it's not quite right. So, the definition of popularity

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.270
doesn't just depend on the number of friends you have,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.000
it depends on, both, the number, and the popularity of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.920
your friends. So, we can change the definition. Let's instead

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.199
define the popularity score of a person p. Now

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.010
it's going to be the sum of the popularities of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.890
all of their friends. So we can write that in

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.590
a mathematical way, so using the sigma means to sum

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.830
up. We're going to take each friend, that is in

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.918
the friends of p. And we're going to sum up the

00:02:24.918 --> 00:02:28.890
popularity score of the friends. If the mathematical notation is

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.320
unfamiliar to you, we could also write this as pseudo

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.520
Python code. We're thinking of the popularity of

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.400
a person p. Let's assume we have a

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.760
function that gives us the friends. So we're

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.050
going to start with a score of zero. We're going to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.140
loop through the friends. And for each friend,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.960
we're going to add to p score, the popularity score

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.370
of the friend. And we'll return the score

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.580
as the result. So now, you've seen a mathematical

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.620
definition of popularity, you've seen the same thing as code. I'm going to ask

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.520
you a very important quiz question next. Its an easy one to get

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.620
right if you try it twice because there's only two answers, but think

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.570
about it carefully. See if you can get it right the first time.
