00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.954
To determine if these statements are true
or false, it's somewhat easier to look at

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:09.735
the diagram we previously discussed. So,
if we look at the first statement, the

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:14.029
integers are a subset of the whole
numbers. We can see that this would be

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:19.033
false because the integers is a larger set
than the set of whole numbers. The whole

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:23.839
numbers are a subset of the integers,
that's true, as is the next statement, the

00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:28.885
natural numbers are a subset of the
integers. However, the whole numbers are

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:34.478
not a subset of the natural numbers. You
can see the natural numbers are actually a

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.046
subset of the whole numbers, which makes
the last statement true as well. However,

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:45.563
if we look at the statement, the integers
are a subset of the natural numbers, this

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:51.295
is also false. Because as you can see, the
natural numbers are a subset of the

00:00:51.307 --> 00:00:57.869
integers. Overall, it's easiest to
determine if a set is a subset of another

00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:04.319
set by looking at the circles. If the
circle is entirely contained within

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:07.804
another circle, it is a subset of the set.
