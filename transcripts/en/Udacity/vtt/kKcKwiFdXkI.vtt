Well, hi and welcome back. We're now starting Unit 5.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The topic of unit 5 is weighted graphs. I'd like to start up with a little magic trick.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You may have seen this sort of plastic ring structure before.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
These are plastic rings that are use to hold six packs together and it turns out

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and I'm going to show you pictures of it, but you can find them in the Internet.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They're very sad that maybe turtles can get themselves stuck in these holes

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and then as they grow, they continue to grow but the hole doesn't,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and they can really damage themselves very badly.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It is suggested that you cut your six pack rings.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Actually introduce new cuts into this plastic structure so that is still connected.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's not a bunch of little tiny pieces, but there's no more rings left in it,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and all the cuts have to be across little pieces of plastic

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
not long plastic or cross multiple plastics at the same time,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but each little bridges of plastic cut that and what I'd like you to do, follow me, let me show you.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Earlier today, I went to the supermarket and I asked them

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
if they'd be willing to give me one of this little plastic ring things.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In particular, apparently I got a very fresh one because it's nice and flat--it just sits here.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This wasn't actually going to hurt any turtles anyway.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Better I should got one from the dump but I don't think

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
my friends in Udacity would have like trash on their nice little pad here.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Here is a ring thing and what would I do is make cuts in the structure

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
so there's no rings left, but the thing is still in one giant piece.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Okay, I did it. Now at the end of the day your little plastic ring thing,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
you should have a series of cuts on it and look there is no loops.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Any place that there's a circle that a turtle can get caught in, I cut it open,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but yet the thing is still in one piece.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Alright, so what you need to do is save the turtles.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You need to cut the bridges in this plastic structure until the plastic stays in one piece

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but there's no loops, no turtle traps.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So you can make which ever cuts where ever you want,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but when you're done write the number in the box.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Don't tell me what it is. Just put it in the box.
