00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.150
Now, let's talk through what possible values d and

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.540
c can have. You may have picked several of

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.490
these choices, but it is okay, you know, whatever

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.810
you picked, it's okay. Let's talk through these different choices,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.640
to see what are possible given this set of

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.710
instructions and the fact that. Processing speed one and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.720
speed two are executing, independently on two different processors

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.190
and, we have no way of knowing, what is going

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.600
on with the shared memory. Now the first possibility, is that, these two

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:39.280
instructions, assignment of, a B to D and C to A, they happen. In time

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.680
order, before any of these instructions executed.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.390
That's possible, because if these shared memory

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.990
accesses happen before these guys, they're responsible

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.680
that both of these instructions are executed before

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.740
any of these instructions executed. In that case, what you would get into DNC

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:05.000
are the old values of a and b, namely zero. The second possibility is that

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.240
the both these instructions that is executed on P2 they're

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.930
executed after both the instructions on P1 have completed

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.380
execution. So in this case, both a has gotten new value, b has gotten a new

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.510
value, and so when we go here and make the assignments. Then both d and c are

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.930
going to have new values that are in b and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.050
a respectively. And so, this is a possibility, right?

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.910
There is a possibility that both c and d have a value of one in them. Let's see

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.240
if the third possibility can happen. The third possibility

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.780
for it to happen, it is conceivable that we insert

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.400
these two instructions in the middle of this. Or

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.240
in other words Process P1 executed this instruction and, and

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.440
in time order, it so happens that these two

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.190
instructions got executed, and then this, this instruction got executed.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.280
And therefore, once you get into d is the old value of b, that is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.389
zero. And once you get into c is the old value of a. I'm sorry, the new value of

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.896
a. Because this instruction is executed. And therefore,

00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:15.980
you get one into c. And that's why this

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.420
possibility is also, is also perfectly valid. Now,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.750
let's look at this last choice that I have.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.330
C gets zero and D gets one. Can this

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.100
happen? C getting a zero and d getting a one.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.840
And the reason I ask you this question is because,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.750
if you look at this piece of code and this

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.005
piece of code here. If d were to get

00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:42.980
one, what that means is that, this assignment of b

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.060
gets b plus one has already happened on P1. That's

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.430
how the new value of b has gotten into d.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.040
But yet, we're saying when this process completes,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.140
c has a value of zero. What does

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.180
that mean? It means that the new value

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.170
of a hasn't come into the processor P2. How

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.850
can this happen? It can happen if messages go out of order. You have to remember

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.880
that, if you recall the picture of the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.730
shared memory machine, you've got an interconnection network that

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.500
is connecting all these processors. And a write

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.740
that happens on this processor has to go

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.560
through the interconnection network and get to this

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.760
other processor. Now it is conceivable that if message

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.060
go out of order. It is possible that

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.550
when this process executes this statement. This new

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.630
value of b has arrived, the message that

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.520
contains a new value you b has arived and

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.240
there for this assignment gets a new value of,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.530
of b, but when the process execute this statement. The

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.090
new value of a hasn't arrived yet and it

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.950
can happen if the messages go out of order and

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.550
in that case, you can end up with this

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.330
particular choice of c having a value of zero and

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.730
d having a value of one when this process

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.440
completes execution. Do you want it to happen? Now intuitively,

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.330
you would see that this is not something

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.330
you expect to happen. As a programmer, you don't

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.010
want surprises, right? And if you don't want surprises,

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.200
perhaps if it is a non-intuitive result, that's something

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.900
that should not be allowed by the model.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.730
So, when we talk about memory consistency model, we're

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.590
saying what is the contract between the programmer and

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.110
system? And what we are seeing through this example

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.410
is that, this particular outcome is counter-intuitive and

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.860
therefore the model should not allow this particular outcome

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.750
to be possible in the execution. And this

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.180
is the reason why you have memory consistency model.
