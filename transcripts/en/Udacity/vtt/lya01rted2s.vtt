00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Remember that the totient of n, where n is the product of two primes,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is the totient of those two primes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Multiplying this out, we get pq - (p + q) + 1.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Pq here is the same as n.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now we know that p + q is equal to n - Ď†(n) - 1.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now we're our goal is to show that if we know Ď†(n) we can easily find p.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If we can find p, we can easily find q.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What we want to do is find an equation for p - q that only uses n.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Then we'd be able to add these two, get rid of the q

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and be able to solve for p as the sum of these two equations divided by 2.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's our goal to get a solution for p - q that doesn't involve n.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Let's see if you can figure that out yourself.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I will give you a hint, which is to think about squaring p - q.
