When multiplying 1 by a power of 10, I can see that the decimal point moves one

00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:08.675
place to the right, it goes here. When I multiply by another power of 10, the

00:00:08.687 --> 00:00:13.006
decimal place moves again to the right, right here. So I can easily tell that

00:00:13.018 --> 00:00:15.289
the decimal point is always moving right.
