00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As I said we should be able to do all these pretty easy--constant time.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The midpoint is the smallest number plus the biggest number divided by 2

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so the average of those two. That's what? 114/2 which is 57.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The median is the number in the middle of the sorted list which let's see--51.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We've got one, two, three, four, five smaller and one, two, three, four, five bigger--so good.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And now we want the mean of these two number, which is 108/2 or 54.
