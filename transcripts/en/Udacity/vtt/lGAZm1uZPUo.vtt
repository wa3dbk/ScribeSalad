00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.790
Now let's take a look at
the Phase I of another protocol.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.510
The purpose of this phase is to
establish a security association, so

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.710
that it can be used
to establish multiple

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.320
IP security associations in Phase II.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.300
In Phase I, both sides negotiate
the protection to be used.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.840
For example, Or ESP.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.940
And agree on the crypto
algorithms to use.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.990
For example, AES and HMAC with SHA1.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.680
Then they establish a shared secret key.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.547
For example,
they can use the Diffie-Hellman key

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:37.213
exchange protocol to prevent
man-in-the-middle attack, or

00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:40.580
generally to authenticate
the shared secret.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.005
Both sides can use either a pre-shared
key or digital signatures or

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.130
public-key encryption to
authenticate the key exchange.
