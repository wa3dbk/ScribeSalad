00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.969
Okay, now let's break up the Demographic
and the Geographic segments.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.860
So the Demographic segmentation is,
you guessed it,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.550
based on your customers Demographic
characteristics, things like age,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.100
gender, occupation, education level,
income level, and much more.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.480
If you're coming from a B2B or

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.100
a business to business point of view,
this could be the size of the company,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.800
the number of employees, or
even the location of the company.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.930
Now for

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.970
the Geographic segmentation, this is
just segmented by geographic areas.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.590
such as the country, regions,
different cities, postal codes.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.410
Now, you can do a geo-cluster approach,
which combines Demographic and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.740
Geographic segmentations.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.910
You'll look at demographic
information within a certain area

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.400
To create a more specific profile.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.720
Do your graphic segmentation
is really important for

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.360
international marketing,
it's usually your first step.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.190
So an example of a Geographic
segmentation would be

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.610
warm climates versus cold.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.710
Climates.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.239
Now you're probably better off
marketing the coats you make

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.490
to a cooler climate than you
are to a warmer climate.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.610
Just as bathing suits might
not sell as as well in

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.510
Alaska as they would in Brazil or
the Caribbean.
