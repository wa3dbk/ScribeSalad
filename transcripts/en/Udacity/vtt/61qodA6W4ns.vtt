And the answer is way too frequently, 3,500 on just a

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:07.997
single day you’d be taking your boss all the time and

00:00:07.997 --> 00:00:10.720
the reason is very simple. You take the 70,000

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.824
over here and you apply a five percent internal

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:15.454
over here and if everything is normal you

00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:17.850
distribute it what you believe it is, you 
get

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.850
3,500 outliers in expectation every day.
