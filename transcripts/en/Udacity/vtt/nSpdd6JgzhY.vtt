00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.820
Let's investigate the main difference between these two techniques.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.770
That difference relates to what moment you would expect the value present on

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.340
gold to influence either of the other two objects.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.930
Is that moment a single moment of copying or

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.090
does it happen at every look up event?

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.730
Modifying the gold object,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.530
reveals an interesting difference between these 2 techniques.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.310
Here, we're adding a new Z property to the gold object.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.360
What do you think happens when we try to log that new value 3 by asking blue for

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.420
its Z property?
