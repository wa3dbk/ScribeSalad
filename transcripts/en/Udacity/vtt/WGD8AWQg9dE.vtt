00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.400
Well, remember, that if we leave the parenthesis off of a function name,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.960
it simple returns the function object rather than calling that function.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.240
Let's see what this looks like in the Chrome console.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.079
So, I need a debugger for right after our pack is created, and

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.590
I'll pause execution and inspect the path object itself.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.230
Here we are in our code.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.250
Right beneath the path object.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.310
And if we simply type path without any parentheses,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.520
we can see here that a function is actually returned and not called.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.370
And if you notice that a path is actually a function

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.230
that takes a single argument.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.780
And acts very similar to the access or

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.570
call back functions, that we've explicitly defined ourselves.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.270
In this case, it gets past the data bound to each element,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.850
and to make this a little bit more explicit.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.770
Let's pass our first GeoJSON country,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.930
in this case Afghanistan, to the path itself.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.270
As you can see here, we're passing a GeoJSON object to our path function.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.510
And what gets spit back is a jumble of strings.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.820
In this case, scrolling to the top of this string,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.330
we see a strange stream of numbers.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.570
Prefaced by the letter M, separated by commas.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.490
This is simply the SVG way to specify which path to draw and

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.800
which pixels to connect on the screen.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.440
Again, d3 being the great library that it is, makes it so

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.660
you don't have to concern yourself with any of this messiness.
