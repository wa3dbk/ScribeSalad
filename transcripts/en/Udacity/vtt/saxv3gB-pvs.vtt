Welcome to lesson three!

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.910
We've covered marketing research and

In this lesson, we'll cover

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.690
app discovered, and how to gain traction
and build your first user base.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.060
growth hacking tips, and other things
you can do with a small budget,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.060
like how to gain media attention, or
just a taste of social media efforts.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.673
