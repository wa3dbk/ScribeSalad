00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.065
So having seen the need for total order and

00:00:03.065 --> 00:00:06.990
an ambiguous decision making in the distributed system let's now

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.690
introduce Lamport's Total Order formulation. This is the notation we're

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.260
going to use for Lamport's Total Order. And so what we

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.350
are saying here is that if there are two

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.770
events A and B in the distributed system, A happens

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.850
to be an event in this case on PI And

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.740
B happens to be an event, on process PJ. If

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.850
we want to assert that, a totally is ordered

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.930
ahead of b, that is a precedes b in the total order. This

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.010
is true only under the condition that either, the time stamp

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.850
associated with A is less than B or the time stamp

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.860
happens to be the same and there is some arbitrary other

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.750
function that helps us to un ambiguously decide

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.040
which event precedes the other and for instance I might say that

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.000
the process ID that I associated with PI and PJ, that maybe

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.820
the one that I use to break the tie. In my family car example, I told

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.570
you that the seniority of the family member

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.860
makes the decision in terms of how we break

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.310
the tie. So for instance in this, in this

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.270
case if process Pi has a process ID 100

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.280
and process Pj has a process ID 200 then

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.040
we could say that the arbitrary decision making in the

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.840
case of a tie is that whichever process has

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.690
a lower process ID, that's going to be the winner. So

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.280
we might, we might decide that in this case,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.200
if time stamp happens to be the same, then since

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.240
Pi is less than Pj, I'm going to say that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.280
a preceeds b. So it's an arbitrary, well-known condition

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.570
for breaking a tie. So every process in the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.630
entire distributive system is going to use the same well-known, arbitrary

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.280
condition in order to break to tie. So that

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.100
also brings up another interesting point, and that is there

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.300
is no single total order. The single total order

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.400
comes from the choice of the arbitraty well known condition.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.150
I gave you the example of my family car,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.010
we broke the tie in the family car situation

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.640
by saying that the seniority is the winner. Tomorrow

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.060
as a family we could make the decision that the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.660
youngest person is going to win. In that case, my

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.270
daughter will have dibs over the car over everybody

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.100
else in the case of a tie. The other

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.950
important point to understand is that all of this idea

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.640
of associating logical time stamps with events, and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.530
then deriving a total order from the logical time

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.690
stamp using this kind of a, a method

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.140
of saying we going to just believe the time stamp

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.840
associated with the respective events. We going to believe

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.710
that time standard are associated with the events and

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.680
use those time stand as a way of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.790
ordering them, so that we can develop total order.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.360
And if it happens to be a tie, everybody

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.170
uses a well known arbitrary condition to break the tie

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.200
and that's how we derive a total order, and

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.540
once we have derived the total order, the time stamps

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.110
are meaningless after that. We don't care about them

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.500
anymore. The whole idea of having these logical time stamps.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.090
Creating a partial order. And from the partial order

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.760
deriving a total order using this formulation. For total ordering.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.080
Is so that we can get a particular total order.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.080
And once we get the total order, timestamps are meaningless.
