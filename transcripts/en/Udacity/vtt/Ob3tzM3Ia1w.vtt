00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.510
So, are you ready for another documentation challenge?

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.350
For this quiz, you'll be using this input box to change the name of

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.795
the Cool Articles section.

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:14.450
I've given you a helper event right here that will run

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.370
the code inside this function right here when the text in the input box changes.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.220
So, can you write code that will change the value of

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.795
this headline to what's written in this box?

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:30.484
Hint, you might want to use .text.
