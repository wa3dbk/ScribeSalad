00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. How do we work out the answer to this?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Well, the number of times that it gets divided in half before it reaches 0

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is this expression--log base 2 of a plus 1.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But notice what's happening.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Each time that we divide it in half, we're actually adding 3 to the pile.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is not quite right.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We actually need to do 3 times this, which is like this,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but then when we get to the bottom, there's going to be 1 more added into the sum.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is the answer.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In this particular instance, we got kind of lucky that we happened to have

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a recurrence relation that we could analyze using one of the formulas that we already worked out.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
One of the things we're going to do next time is look at these kinds of relationships more generally.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
How do we take a recurrence relation and turn it into a concrete formula without getting

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
bogged down in all of the details.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
One of the things we're going to try to do is ignore some of these pesky constants

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
like the 3s and the 4s and so forth,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so we can take a function like T(a) and say, well,

00:00:52.000 --> 09:59:59.000
it kind of grows in a log-like manner and not really get too worried about the details.
