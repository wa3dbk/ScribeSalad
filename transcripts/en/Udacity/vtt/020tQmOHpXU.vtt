00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's just take a look at the last piece which is why you're here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
How do we teach entrepreneurship?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well, in the past, entrepreneurial education was about execution.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're going to teach you how to write a business plan.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We're going to teach you how to put together the power point for the VC presentation.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If we're doing it really well, we'll have you lots of research.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But it really assumed it was all about execution. What we now know that's just simply not the case.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Entrepreneurial education, the reason why you're taking this class

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is about the search for the business model and we're going to teach you how to search.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And so what that means about entrepreneurial education is that eventually

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we do need you to know everything an MBA knows.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Eventually if your success in growing your startup into a large company,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
you're going to need to know about accounting and HR

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and organizational behavior and global leadership and etc.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But at first, you need a different set of skills that just never existed before,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and so welcome to the first class of its type that's going to put search first and that's a radical change.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's not just one more methodology.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This class is going to teach you all the skills about strategy and process and organization

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and eventually if you build a successful company, we'll then allow you to write the plans

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and operating documents and financial spreadsheets to actually execute the company.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Hold on to your seats, we're about to get started and let's jump in

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to business models and customer development.
