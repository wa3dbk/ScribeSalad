00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.616
Let's start with our vertical line and just pick 2 random points along it. So,

00:00:04.628 --> 00:00:09.282
here's a point, and here's a point. The coordinates of this line point are 2,7.

00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:13.719
And this is the point 2, negative 3. The coordinate these 2 points on the

00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:19.159
vertical line share is the x-coordinate. So I guess, all points on a vertical

00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:24.474
line have the same x-coordinate. Let's do the same thing for a horizontal line.

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:28.498
We have the point negative 8, negative 5, and another point 5, negative 5. These

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.408
two points, along the horizontal line, share their y value. So, I guess, all

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.952
points along horizontal lines have the same y value.
