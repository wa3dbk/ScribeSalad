00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.760
The second distinguishing aspect of RUP is that it

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.290
is architecture-centric. As we saw in the first lesson

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.340
of this mini-course, a software architecture is a view

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.740
of the entire system that represents all high level

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.710
principal design decisions. Another way to see this is

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.640
by saying that use cases define the function of

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.220
the system, where as architecture defines the form of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.260
the system. Use cases give the functionality, architecture tells

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.670
you how the system should be structured to provide the functionality.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.000
So how do we define a software architecture in the rational

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.730
unified process. Also in this case this happens through

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.340
a sort of a iterative process. We start by creating a rough

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.070
outline of the system. And in this case we do it

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.260
independently from the functionality. So this is just the general structure

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.770
of the system. For example, we model aspects such as the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.840
platform on which the system will run, the overall style. For example,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.780
whether it's a client server or a peer to peer

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.450
system and so on. We then use the key use cases

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.550
in our use case diagram to define the main subsystems of

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.470
my architecture. For example, in the case of a banking IT

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.150
system, one of these subsystems might be the withdrawal system. So

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.410
what will happen in that case is that we will have

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.240
some use case that refers to the withdrawal activity, and by

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.470
analyzing that use case, we'll realize that we need a subsystem

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.810
that implements that piece of functionality. So again, we use

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.680
the key use cases to identify and define the key

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.290
subsystems for my architecture. So once we have that we

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.510
keep refining the architecture by using additional use cases. So

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.030
considering more and more pieces of functionality that will help

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.430
us to refine the architecture of the system and also

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.260
leveraging our increasing understanding of the system that we're modeling.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.470
And this will continue until we are happy with the

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.550
architecture that we define.
