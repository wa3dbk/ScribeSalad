We need to put a little n next to our radical sign to show the nth root of x or

00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:09.762
x to the 1 over n power. So if we write the 5th root of x for example, that's

00:00:09.774 --> 00:00:14.664
just equal to x to the 1 5th, and similarly, for the 8th root of x. Square roots

00:00:14.676 --> 00:00:19.253
then, are the one xception to our rule. It's like there's an invisible two

00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:23.211
written next to the radical sign here, but according to convention, we just

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.102
don't write any number for square roots.
