00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.128
Our solution is 6 minus x, divided by the quantity x minus 8. Great job if you

00:00:05.128 --> 00:00:09.759
got this rational expression. We factor the numerator the same as before, but

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:15.536
this time in the denominator we want factors of -8 and positive 6. They multiply

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:21.090
to give us -48, and a sum to get us -2. I noticed that x plus 6 and 6 plus x are

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.374
really the same factors.So I can cancel those since they equal 1. This leaves me

00:00:26.374 --> 00:00:30.864
with the remaining factors, so I have 6 minus x divided by x minus 8. You might

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:34.634
have switched the order of these two terms, giving you negative x plus 6 for the

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:38.684
numerator. This would be okay. You might even have gone a step further, and

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:42.965
factored negative 1 from the numerator, and that would have been okay too. All

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:47.157
of these answers are correct. And if you even followed my advice from the first

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:50.141
time, a negative sign out in front would look like this.
