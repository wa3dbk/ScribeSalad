00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.625
The two goals of congestion control are

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:07.530
fairness; meaning every send gets their fair share

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.410
of the network resources. And efficiency meaning

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.100
that the network resources are used well. In

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.920
other words we shouldn't have a case

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.360
where there are spare capacity or resources in

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.210
the network And senders have data to send, but are not able to send it.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.570
So, we'd like the network to be used efficiently, but we'd also like it to be

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.710
shared among the senders. We can represent fairness

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.380
and efficiency in terms of a phase plot,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.580
where each axis representers a particular user or particular senders.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.320
Allocation. In this case we just have two users, one and two,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.380
and we represent their allocations with x1 and x2. If the

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.078
capacity of the network is C, then we can represent the optimal operating line.

00:00:56.078 --> 00:01:02.950
As X1 + X2 being some constant, C. Anything to the left of this

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.440
diagonal line represents under utilization of the

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.130
network, and anything to the right of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.790
the line represents overload. We can also

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.640
represent another line, X1 = X2 as some

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.450
notion of fair allocation. So the optimal point, is where the network is neither

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.730
under or over utilized, and when the allocation is fair. So being on

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.980
this diagonal line represents efficiency, and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.440
being on the green diagonal line represents

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.800
fairness. We can use the phase plot to understand why senders who use additive

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.080
increase, multiplicative decrease, converge to fairness.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.420
The senders also converge, to the efficient

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.750
operating point. Let's suppose that we start at the operating point shown in

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.090
blue. At this point both senders will additively increase their sending rates.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.590
Additive increase results in moving along a line that is parallel to x1 and x2,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.770
since both senders increase their rate by the same amount. Additive increase

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.160
will continue. Until the network becomes

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.920
overloaded. At this point the senders will

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.260
see a loss and perform multiplicative

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.620
decrease. In multiplicative decrease each sender decreases

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.990
its rate by some constant factor of its current sending rate. For example,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.060
suppose each one of these senders decreases its

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.530
sending rate by half. The resulting operating point,

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.990
is shown by this second blue dot. Note

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.790
that that new operating point, as a result

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.730
of multiplicative decrease, is on a line between

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.630
the point on the efficiency line, that the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.790
centers hit, and the origin. At this point

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.430
the sender's will again increase their sending rate

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.080
along a line that's parallel to X1 equals X2 until they hit over load again.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.290
At which point they will again retreat towards the origin. You can see that

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.480
eventually, the senders will reach this optimal

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.860
operating point through the path. That's delineated by

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.580
the blue line. To think about this a bit more you can see that every

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.480
time additive increase is applied, that increases efficiency.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.500
Every time multiplicative decrease is applied that improves

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.450
fairness because every time. We apply multiplicative decrease,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.250
we get closer to this x1 equals x2 line.
