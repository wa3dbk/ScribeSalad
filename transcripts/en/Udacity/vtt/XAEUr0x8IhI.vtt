00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.754
There are even more problems with simply sorting objects and drawing them

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:07.992
roughly back to front. For example, notice that the back faces are not shown for

00:00:07.992 --> 00:00:12.570
any transparent objects. If you turn back faces on, you'll start to get strange

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.045
rendering art effects. Some back faces will be drawn before front faces blend

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:22.430
with them, some won't, giving this patchy look. For example, here's a view of a

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.370
block from the side, along with an order that the phases are drawn. Since phase

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.159
1 is drawn first, phase 2 blends with it. Phase 3 is drawn filling the z-buffer

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:38.466
and also blends with phase 1. Phase 4 is behind phase 3, so is invisible when

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:44.206
rendered. Of the two back faces, in this case only phase 1 has had an effect on

00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:48.856
the image generated. Even with back face calling on, and a good sort order, you

00:00:48.856 --> 00:00:53.600
can still have problems with different sized objects. Say a ground plane and a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.056
red object resting in it are both transparent. The middle of the ground plane is

00:00:58.056 --> 00:01:03.431
closer to the camera. So by sort order, it will be drawn after the red object.

00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:08.647
This will make the ground plane appear to be above the red object. Here's one

00:01:08.647 --> 00:01:13.284
more problem with transparency. Complex objects can have two or more surfaces

00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:17.630
overlapping a single pixel. Again it depends on draw order as to what appears on

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.465
the screen. If the fragment on the left is drawn first, then the fragment on the

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:26.376
right will en-properly blend with it at this pixel. There's even research about

00:01:26.376 --> 00:01:29.722
the ordering of triangles in the mesh itself to avoid these problems. But this

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:34.710
type of technique can be costly to apply. At this point you might have given up

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.980
all hope for transparency always working right. The z-buffer was meant to store

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.945
only one object at a time and unless you can guarantee the order of objects

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:46.916
covering the pixels, there's little else you can do. There are some further

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:50.372
tricks you can do by only reading and not writing to the z-buffer, but there's

00:01:50.372 --> 00:01:54.666
no perfect solution. If you desperately want to get the right answer, there is

00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:59.394
one technique that works fairly well called Depth-Peeling. The idea is to peel

00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:03.796
away each transparent layer until all layers are processed, by storing an

00:02:03.796 --> 00:02:08.978
additional minimum z-depth for each pixel. So for example, the first layer is

00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:14.584
all the transparent surfaces closes to the camera. The second layer is all the

00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:19.266
second closes surfaces. The third and fourth layers are processed and turned

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:23.365
until the whole object is rendered. That's conceptually the key idea, see the

00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:27.425
additional course materials for more about this algorithm. The draw back is that

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:31.760
each peel operation needs to have all the transparent objects rendered again.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.674
Many passes may be needed before all the layers are found and processed.

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:39.940
Ultimately what would solve the transparency problem is storing a list of all

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.532
the transparent fragments in each pixel, along with their depths. This approach

00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:48.450
is known as the A-Buffer. Once we have all this information, we can then combine

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.280
these fragments in the right order. This type of storage is possible in newer

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.372
GPU's for the desktop, but can use a considerable amount of memory. What's

00:02:57.372 --> 00:03:01.928
interesting is that mobile devices usually use a different architecture called

00:03:01.928 --> 00:03:06.130
Tile Based that can more easily keep such fragment lists around. Yet another

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.842
approach is called Stochastic Transparency. Which uses Screen-Door Transparency

00:03:10.842 --> 00:03:14.685
width in the pixel itself, along with some randomness to get it a reasonable

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:18.924
average result. This brings us full circle back to the original transparency

00:03:18.924 --> 00:03:22.644
algorithm I presented. There's no simple answer on the GPU.
