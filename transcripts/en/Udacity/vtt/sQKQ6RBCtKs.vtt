00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
That was a highlighted summary of a lot of the key concepts in the course,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
especially if you're taking notes at home.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And now we're going to do a bunch of review questions.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Many of them should seem very easy. That's intentional.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We just want to go over the material and get it fresh in your mind,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and the expectation is that you'll do harder studying on your own.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Mastering the material involves personal responsibility.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You're going to have to put extra time into it at the end.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
All right. First quiz: regular expressions.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I have written a Python format regular expression here at the top of the slide,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and what I'd like you to do is indicate which of the strings listed here match it exactly.

00:00:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Multiple multiple choice. List all that are correct.
