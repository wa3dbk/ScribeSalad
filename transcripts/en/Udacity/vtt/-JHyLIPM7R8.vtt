00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The trick is to add these two lines to the diagram.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We know the slope of this line, which is -1 over the time constant for the heat loss.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We know the length of this line, which is the jump, and the rate of change of the temperature.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The heating value times the burning rate.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This term makes the difference between burning and not burning,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and now we can use the slope to express the ratio of this leg to this leg.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
1 over the time constant for the heat loss equals the ratio of the vertical length to the horizontal length.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The vertical length, the green line, is h times the burn rate and the burn rate is the wood's density

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
over the time constant of burning, and the horizontal length is 1,200 K minus the ambient temperature.

00:00:51.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You solve this equation for h, plug in these numbers, and then you get 135 K/kg/m².
