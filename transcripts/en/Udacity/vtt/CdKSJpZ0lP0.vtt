00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.936
For floating point, each color channel is defined as values from 0 to 1. 0, 0, 0

00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:11.110
is black, 1, 1, 1 is white. Setting just the red channel gives red, green to

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.198
green and blue to blue. Where things go off the tracks for some people is when

00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:21.228
we set a color as follows, RGB of 1, 1 and 0. This is to make a color using the

00:00:21.228 --> 00:00:25.460
red and green channels at their maximum and with no blue. If I take red paint

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.456
and green paint and mix them together, I get at best a murky brown. This happens

00:00:30.456 --> 00:00:34.287
because paint colors are formed by absorption of various wave lengths of light.

00:00:34.288 --> 00:00:38.401
The color model for mixing paints and inks is called subtractive color. The

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:43.406
three primary colors used in printing are cyan Magenta and yellow, with black

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:47.832
added as its own dark ink. This printing system is called CMYK with K standing

00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:52.031
for key and essentially meaning black. As different colors are mixed, the

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:56.472
pigments become darker over all. In computer graphics a monitor, such as this

00:00:56.472 --> 00:01:00.978
one, emits light of different labelings. Our eyes see light in wavelengths

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:06.370
between 390 and 750 manometers. Longer wavelength light is red, shorter is blue

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.337
with the rainbow in between. If we specify some red and some green light then

00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:14.478
these contributions are added together giving a brighter color overall. This

00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:18.277
color model is called additive color. See the additional course material for

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:22.218
more articles about this area. If you want a particular color, the additive

00:01:22.218 --> 00:01:26.464
color RGB values are what you will need to determine. To get familiar with this

00:01:26.464 --> 00:01:29.223
way of mixing colors try out the demo that follows.
