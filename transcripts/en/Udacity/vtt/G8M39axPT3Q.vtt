00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.591
Here's an abstract specification
of a knowledge-based AI method for

00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:06.390
doing configuration design.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.828
The process starts with
some specifications.

00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:12.899
These might be the specifications of all
the constraints on this configuration

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.170
problem, for example the constraints
on David's basement.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.050
The output is an arrangement model,
a model of the arrangement of

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.090
all the components with the components
already known, for example,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.470
the arrangement of David's basement.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.510
In this matter, for
some configuration design,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.540
we begin with some very abstract,
and perhaps partial solutions.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.310
This abstract and

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.650
partial solution may be represented
in the form of a design plan.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.350
So, an abstract and journal plan for
basements of houses.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.160
Each plan specifies a subset
of all the variables.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.430
We assign values to
the variables in that plan.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.300
The plan is now complete.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.138
A completed plan can now be refined and
expanded.

00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:58.689
At the next lower level,
the plan specifies more variables.

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:00.965
We assign values to those variables.

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:03.554
Now that plan at the next
level is complete, and

00:01:03.554 --> 00:01:07.977
we continue this iterative process until
we have a complete arrangement model.

00:01:07.977 --> 00:01:11.133
As an example, if somebody was
building a residential home,

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:15.080
like David is doing right now, then the
abstract plan may deal with the number

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.988
of stories that the house will have.

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:21.190
Once we assign to the variable
number of stories,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.580
then we get a more expanded and
refined plan where we have a plan for

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.410
each of the stories
including the basement.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.000
For example, for the main floor,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.480
there might be a plan which specifies
something about a kitchen area,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.740
something about a living area,
something about a bedroom area.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.880
As we assign values to the variables
that define the living area, and

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.260
the kitchen area, and the bedroom area,
this plan gets completed.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.640
And now we might refine it further, a
more detailed plan for the living area,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.840
for example.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.536
This abstraction hierarchy is
a diagrammatic representation of this

00:01:51.536 --> 00:01:54.380
plan's arrangement
from those abstraction.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.427
I begin with the most abstract plan,
then I refine them and

00:01:57.427 --> 00:01:59.630
expand them as I go down.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.930
As I said earlier in
configuration design,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.310
all the components are already known.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.860
Nevertheless, in some cases it might
be able to also select the components.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.520
So for example, I might not only
be able to reconfigure the TV,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.290
I might also be able to
pick a specific kind of TV.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.780
So this might be a TV in general and
a more specific kind of TV and

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.340
more specific kind of TV and so on.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.170
Note that the arrows coming
here are two way arrows.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.682
This is intentional.

00:02:27.682 --> 00:02:31.130
In particular, let us look at the two
way arrows between the arrangement model

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.400
and the process of configuration and
the specifications and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.140
the configuration process.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.880
Once this process has
yielded an arrangement model,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.410
then we can assess the arrangement model
and if needed go back to the process.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.100
As an example,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.420
the configuration process says that
the TV is 12 feet away from the couch.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.440
And we assess it, and we decide
the couch is too close to the TV.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.040
Then we can go back to the process and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.390
say, make the couch more than
12 feet away from the TV.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.530
That then becomes an additional
specification here.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.090
And this is the meaning
of the two way arrow.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.043
It is not just that we start with
specifications and the configuration

00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:12.666
process works to satisfy them, but also,
as the configuration process works and

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:15.958
results in solutions,
we can evaluate those solutions.

00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.164
And the specifications may change.

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.671
This is a very common
property of all design.

00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:22.888
One of the major differences
between design and

00:03:22.888 --> 00:03:24.995
problem solving is that
in problem solving,

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:28.990
the problem typically remains fixed
when we come up with a solution.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.460
In contrast in design, the problem
evolves as the solution evolves.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.660
The problem and the solution co-evolve.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.580
So we start with a problem of satisfying
certain constraints, but as the solution

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.000
evolves, the evolution of the solution
results in the evolution of a problem.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.710
As an example,
let us suppose that the configuration

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.850
problem is to configure the parts
of a computer processor so

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.700
that the processor can work
at a particular speed.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.240
To do so, you come up with
an arrangement model, but

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.800
when you evaluate it,
you find that the processor overheats.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.900
In that case, you may change
the specification and say that

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.480
the specification is not only that
the processor should be fast enough, but

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.460
also that it should not overheat.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.800
This is an example of problem
evolution and solution evolution.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.150
Now that the problem has evolved,
you may come up with a new solution for

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.937
the processor design.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.160
This now is an example of problem
evolution and solution evolution.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.310
&gt;&gt; So for an example that might hit
a little bit closer to home for

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.030
many of you, as you've been
designing your agents that can solve

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.240
the Raven's test, you've done
a process somewhat like this.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.390
You started with some specifications,
general specifications, that your agent

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.876
must be able to solve as many problems
on the Raven's test as possible.

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:38.860
You then start with an abstract solution
of just a general problem solving

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.680
process that you may have then refined
to be more specific about the particular

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.050
transformations to look for or

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.350
the particular problem
solving methods to use.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.940
That got you to your final result.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.780
But when you ran your file result, you
may have found something like it would

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.880
work but it would take a very,
very long time to run, weeks or months.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.220
So that then causes you to
revise your specifications.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.430
You not only need an agent that can
solve as many problems as possible, but

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.310
you also need one that can
solve it in minutes or

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.900
seconds instead of weeks or months.
