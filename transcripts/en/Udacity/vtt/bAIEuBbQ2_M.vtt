00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.205
We're going to use our knowledge of radicals and factoring to solve quadratic

00:00:03.205 --> 00:00:06.896
equations. We'll use three different strategies in this unit, and we'll learn

00:00:06.896 --> 00:00:11.190
them one by one. The three methods are the square root method, completing the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.040
square and the quadratic formula. First, we'll learn each of the methods, and

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.695
then you'll have a chance to pick which method you think is best to use in

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:22.506
different cases. For this lesson let's start by focusing on the square root

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:23.410
method.
