00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.660
Most marketing plans will start with
a lot of what we learned in lesson one,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.030
like who's your audience?

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.480
Who are the personas, or
what segments are you going to focus on?

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.870
You'll consider your competitive
analysis and your value proposition.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.480
So now we've identified
our marketing goals,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.150
we can focus on creating
our distribution plan.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.870
The distribution plan
will focus on how and

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.980
where we're going to reach
our potential customers.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.660
Now of course, we're not trying to
make a full marketing plan that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.690
the chief marketing officer at
a Fortune 500 company might make.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.200
But we try to focus on the most
effective parts of the plan, that

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.080
will help you figure out your action
plan to take your product to market.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.500
But first, we need to do some research.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.220
There are a few tools and

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.110
different options we'll go over to
help you conduct market research.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.510
The goal is to look for insights that'll
allow us to select some starting points,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.510
not to come up with
a super elaborate plan.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.430
Remember marketing is all about making
a hypothesis, testing the market, and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.740
then adjusting.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.964
Be sure to write down your
hypothesis and results, so

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.500
you that you learn what worked and
what didn't work.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.250
Now we're going to go ahead and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.770
use Ebarknet as our research example
when we talk about different tools.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.410
