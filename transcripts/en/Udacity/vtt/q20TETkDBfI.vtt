00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.768
Enough talk,
let's see this app in action.

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:07.503
I'll open up the Pirate Fleet Xcode
project, and then I'll launch the app.

00:00:07.503 --> 00:00:10.513
And as soon as the game launches,
we begin in the guessing phase,

00:00:10.513 --> 00:00:13.031
as opposed to when we actually
get to place our ships and

00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:16.550
our mines, and
that's something you'll do in code.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.620
Now we've kept the UI pretty simple.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.970
Here at the top we have the opponent's
grid, and at the bottom we have

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.890
our grid with our ships and
our mines that have already been placed.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.820
Now as I start guessing, I want you
to think about what objects and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.018
relationships may exist
between the scenes.

00:00:32.018 --> 00:00:34.828
So I'm going to start guessing and
I have a little strategy in mind.

00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:38.773
I'll try to guess every two spaces
because I feel like that will give me

00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:43.608
a pretty good shot at hitting a ship,
being that the smallest ship's size two.

00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:44.888
So I hit a mine.

00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:47.872
Hopefully I won't fall
too far behind here.

00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:49.160
Got one ship.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.920
And it looks like they're doing some
work on my big ships right now.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.660
Yes, here we go.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.014
All right,
I got the two big ships out of the way.

00:01:03.014 --> 00:01:05.200
There we go.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.520
Uh-oh, I think they might
all be lined up here.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.780
So if I have enough time,
I may be able to get all of them.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.580
There we go!
