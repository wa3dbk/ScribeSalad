00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Evans] So rather than speculate on why that is, this brings us to the end of Unit 2.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Our main focus for Unit 2 was how to use symmetric encryption to solve problems.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For the first part we focused on this key,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the need to generate a random key, which is a very hard problem,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and we saw that we could use physical randomness

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
if we had enough available to do this,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but there's no way mechanically to produce a perfectly random key.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But we could use a pseudo-random number generator built using encryption

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to take a small amount of random data and amplify that

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to produce more pseudo-random data.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We saw how to use a symmetric cipher to take a small amount of random data

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and produce a sequence of values that appear to be pseudo-random.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We also looked at the problem of how to encrypt a large file or a large message,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and that brought us to look at modes of operation for using symmetric ciphers.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We talked about the cipher block chaining mode,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the counter mode, and the cipher feedback mode,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
all of which have different advantages and disadvantages.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We also looked at how to do fair coin tosses remotely,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and that led us to the need for cryptographic hash functions.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We saw how to use those to check user passwords

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in a way that doesn't require us to keep any secrets on the server,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and we also saw how to use hash chains to make it

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
so those passwords never needed to be reused.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The big problem we haven't addressed yet is how to establish a shared key.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If we want to use a symmetric cipher to allow 2 parties to communicate,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
they have to agree upon the shared key beforehand.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If you think about most ways we want to communicate today, that's very difficult.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If you visit a secure website, you don't have a shared secret with them to begin with,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
but you want to start communicating securely with them despite not having a shared secret.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And for most uses of cryptography today this is a really big problem.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We can't assume that we have a shared secret with every website that we want to use.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We need some way to establish a shared secret without having one to begin with.

00:02:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's the main topic of Unit 3. I hope to see you there.
