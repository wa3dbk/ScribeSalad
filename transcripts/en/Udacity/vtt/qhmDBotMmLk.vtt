00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.070
Caseless reasoning has a very strong connection with human cognition as well.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.100
Analogical reasoning in general is considered to be a core process of cognition.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.880
But analogical reasoning depends upon a spectrum of similarity. At oned

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.150
end of this spectrum are problems which are identical to previously encountered

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.420
problems. In that case, we simply have to retrieve the previous solution and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.200
apply it. At the other end of the spectrum, are problems with just

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.220
semantically very dissimilar from previously encountered problems. We'll discuss

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.540
those problems later in the class. In the middle of the spectrum are problems.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.910
Which are similar, but not identical, to previously encountered parts. So now,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.090
we need to retrieve the past solutions, tweak them, and apply them.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.550
It is this middle of the spectrum, which is most common in human cognition.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.030
Again, going back over cognitive architecture, which had 3 components.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.080
Reasoning, learning, and memory. Learning by recording cases shifted

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.930
the balance from reasoning to learning and memory. Case we can contrast unifies

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.750
the three of them. It says learning is important because we need to acquire and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.200
store experiences. Memory is important because we need to be able to retrieve

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.340
those experiences when needed. And reasoning is important because we need to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.710
be able to tweak those experiences to encounter the needs of new problems.
