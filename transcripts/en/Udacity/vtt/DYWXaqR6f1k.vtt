00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.212
To get x by itself, and come up with our solutions, we need to get rid of our

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:08.701
exponent. So, we need to take the square root of both sides. Taking the square

00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:12.841
root of x squared just gives us x, and on the right side, we need to take the

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:17.183
positive and negative versions of the square root of negative 9. Now, let's

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:21.483
think about what to do with this radical and the number underneath it. We can

00:00:21.483 --> 00:00:25.761
rewrite negative 9 as negative 1 times 9 and as we learned before, if we have

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:30.246
two factors both written under a radical sign, we can apply the radical to both

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:34.833
of them individually, just like we can with exponents. So now, we have plus or

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:39.285
minus the square root of negative 1 times the square root of 9. Now, the square

00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:43.622
root of negative 1 is just i, and the square root of 9 is just 3. So, our answer

00:00:43.622 --> 00:00:48.799
is plus or minus 3i. Remember, that this means that if we substitutes in either

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:53.020
3i or negative 3i in place of x, it will satisfy our equation.
