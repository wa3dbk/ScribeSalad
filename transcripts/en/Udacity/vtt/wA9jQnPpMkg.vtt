00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.717
I started to show you over the past few videos, how we can begin with an

00:00:03.717 --> 00:00:08.007
equation in the standard form for a parabola, and then transform it so that it's

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.972
written in a form where we can read off the coordinates of the vertex right

00:00:11.972 --> 00:00:16.312
away. This is a really powerful tool. Since we've learned now how to recognize

00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:20.216
the vertex of a parabola from it's graph and also the role that, that vertex

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:24.502
plays in characterizing the equation of the parabola. As we delve more deeply

00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:27.922
into how to get equations in this form, we're going to be more and more

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:30.760
successful about recognizing and graphing parabolas.
