00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.980
But let's presume you really need a raster image

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.590
because some things just can't be represented well by a

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.250
vector drawing. This is a 21 megapixel photo of my

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.870
cat. Obviously, you probably really don't need that resolution pushed

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.239
down to a mobile device if I'm just writing

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.760
a blog post about my cat. This is a 4

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.440
megabyte image after all. So what should we do with

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.670
this image to deliver it to different devices? Your first

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.480
option is to kind of cheat. You can always

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.509
deliver a high resolution but low quality encoding

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.970
everywhere. That is, give this same image to

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.940
all devices. That's a higher resolution, a 2x

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.960
image for example. But lower the quality in

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.600
the jpeg encoder to 20 rather than 90.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.100
This typically can result in a 2X image

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.950
that will look better than an uncompressed 1X image.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.170
And you'll notice at the same time, it actually has

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.660
a smaller file size. Using this technique will work well

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.700
in many cases. But it does come at a cost.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.910
The browser also needs to spend some time decompressing the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.940
image, and on a 1x device, it needs to scale

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.870
the image by 50% to fit it into the available

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.731
pixels. You can also start to see some color [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:16.090
and some gradients using this approach. Sure, lower pixel count

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.410
devices will get a bigger image than they need But not too much more data since

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.200
it's low quality. In higher pixel count devices,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.480
we'll get the right size. Although they will get

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.410
a slightly lower quality image than they would

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.140
normally want. This option isn't great, but it's definitely

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.140
better than only serving low pixel count art.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.990
Or serving only high pixel count to all devices.
