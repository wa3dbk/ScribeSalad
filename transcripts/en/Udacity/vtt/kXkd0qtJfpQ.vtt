00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We want to do even more with regular expressions,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
such as matching a word or a number.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
To do this, we're going to introduce a visual representation for regular expressions

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that actually shows exactly what's going on behind the scenes,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then we're going to follow along in Python.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Suppose we have the regular expression [0 - 9] + % sign.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Any character like this that just appears on its own is matched directly,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
so this catches strings like 30%, 99%, 2% and various other things we might find

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
describing sales or the fat content of milk.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Here I've drawn a finite state machine, a visual representation of this regular expression.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Often there's an arrow coming out of nowhere on the left that's not connected

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to the rest of the picture.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That indicates where we start.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
These 3 circles are states.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
They represent what we're up to when we're matching a string

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
against the regular expression--

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
what configuration we're in, what our current state of mind is, what we've seen so far.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I've labeled my states 1, 2, and 3.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
These other arrows are called edges or transitions.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They tell us when to move from 1 state to another.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I start in state 1, and if I see a 0 - 9, I move over to state 2.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This 0 - 9 is the label associated with this edge.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Finally, you'll notice that 1 of my states has a double circle.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That's an accepting state.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
If we end up in an accepting state at the end of the input,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
this finite state machine matches the given string.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Let's trace through what happens on input 23%.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We start in the start state, and the character we see is a 2,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
so we follow this edge to state 2.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now the next thing we see is a 3, so we follow this edge back to state 2.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
These are sometimes called self-loops.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's a loop that takes me back to right where I started.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now we see the % sign, and we end up in state 3, which is an accepting state,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
so our finite state machine accepts this string '23%' just like our regular expression would.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Let's try just the string '2'.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We start in the start state. We see a 2, so we move over here, and then we're done.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We ran out of input, but we're not in an accepting state.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Our finite state machine rejects this just like our regular expression would.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Finally, let's consider the string '2x'.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We start here in state 1. We see a 2, so we go over to state 2.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Then we see an x, and there's no outgoing edge from state 2 on an x,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
so we fall off the finite state machine and die.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This is very sad, and when this happens our finite state machine does not accept the string,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.123
just like the regular expression would not.
