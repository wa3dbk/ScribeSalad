00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.974
Here are some factor pairs for negative 24. I made the first factor negative in

00:00:04.974 --> 00:00:08.825
each of the pairs. I know that none of these pairs could sum to negative 5 since

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:12.341
the greater number is in the right hand column. All these sums would be

00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:16.270
positive. If I make the second factor negative, I can see that the sum of each

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.306
of these factor pairs would end up being negative. So, the factor pair of

00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:26.564
negative 8 and 3 sum to negative 5. We can rewrite our negative 5x and negative

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:30.999
8x and positive 3x using these two factors. When our factor pairs are negative

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.574
and positive, it's generally easier to list the negative term first. This makes

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:39.115
our factoring by grouping a little bit easier. We can factor our 4x from the

00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:43.690
first two terms, and a positive 1 from the second two terms, since the only

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.974
factor that these two terms share is 1. I used brackets around this part of the

00:00:47.974 --> 00:00:53.040
factoring because I have parentheses inside. For this inside bracket portion, we

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.566
have common factors of 3x minus 2, so we can factor that out, leaving us with

00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.793
our final complete factored form.
