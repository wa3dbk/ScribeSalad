00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.905
Let's try our hand at another unfrosted cake problem. If 1/6 of a cake is

00:00:03.917 --> 00:00:08.083
frosted with strawberry icing and 3/8 is frosted with blueberry icing, what

00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:12.278
fraction of cake is not frosted? To set up this problem, let's give ourselves a

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.382
picture of what's going on. Here are two rectangular cakes and I have 1/6 of it

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:20.773
frosted in strawberry icing. For this other cake, I'm going to frost 3/8 of it

00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:25.102
in blueberry icing. Notice I've split up the cake into 8 equal parts and I have

00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:29.334
3 of those 8 frosted or 3/8. I'm not working with two cakes though, I'm working

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:33.114
with one cake. So, let's visualize these two cakes on one. I'm going to show

00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:37.554
that here. So, notice I have 1/6 of the cake frosted in strawberry icing and 3/8

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:41.764
of it frosted in blueberry icing. And we're trying to figure out what fraction

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:45.895
is not frosted. The chocolate part. To set up this problem, we know we're going

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:50.066
to start with one whole cake. Then, I need to subtract off 1/6 of the cake and

00:00:50.078 --> 00:00:54.891
3/8 of the cake. So, I have 1 minus 1/6 minus 3/8. I can compare sixth to

00:00:54.903 --> 00:00:58.939
eighths right now, they are different size pieces so I can't just subtract these

00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:02.759
numbers. I need to get a common denominator, just like we did when adding

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:06.743
fractions. So, let's try this with a quiz and see if we can remember how to find

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:10.859
the common denominator. What do you think the common denominator would be for

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:15.430
these fractions? Remember, you can list the multiples or use the factor tree.

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:20.319
You don't have to worry about the one when finding the common denominator. This

00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:25.963
is because we can change the 1 into 2/2, 3/3, 12/12, or even a 107/107. All of

00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:29.691
these numbers are still equal to one. So, what's the common denominator for

00:01:29.703 --> 00:01:33.367
these fractions? You can put your answers in this box here. Remember, to find

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:37.380
the common demominator, you can list the multiples or use the factor tree.
