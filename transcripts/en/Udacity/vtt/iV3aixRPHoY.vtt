00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.650
What are incubators and accelerators and
how can they help your startup?

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.910
Incubators and accelerators are programs
meant to speed up the growth and

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.320
success of startups.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.490
They provide resources for
your idea and give you the focus and

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.830
direction necessary to gain some
traction for your business.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.080
Think of them basically like how
an incubator works for an egg.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.900
The egg, like your idea, already exists,
but it's the resources and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.410
careful nurturing of it that allow
it to grow into its new environment.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.510
Let's take a look at some of the
benefits of working with incubators and

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.920
accelerators.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.270
The main benefits you'll get in these
programs are networking and services.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.110
First, networking, incubators and
accelerators provide a ton of

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.620
opportunities for networking between
you, other entrepreneurs, and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.790
coaches that are part of the program.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.480
This can help you gain the foundation
you need to mature as a business.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.870
Next, services, the connections you
get often extend beyond coaches,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.580
into networks you can use to
get funding, services, and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.850
mentorship, which can be an invaluable
asset to the growth of your startup.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.750
If you don't currently have a strong
network or don't know where to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.880
get the skills you need,
this can be a great place to start.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.090
So those are some of the benefits but
what are some of the downsides.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.830
Here's two focus and equity.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.160
First while all this guidance and
networking can be an incredible

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.430
experience, this can make it difficult
to focus on your business and

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.190
give it the attention it
needs to grow effectively.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.990
Make sure to find the balance between
meeting people to talk about your

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.440
business and actually building it.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.890
Next equity, both incubators and
accelerators are meant to jumpstart your

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.900
business and
what they want in return is equity.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.610
You're likely to get a substantial
amount of equity in return for

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.130
your experience.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.950
If your business takes off,
this could become very costly later on.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.650
You'll need to be sure the value
you're getting is worth the value

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.770
you're giving up.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.760
If you have strong connections or
are growing quickly already,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.580
then these programs might not provide
the right value for you moving forward.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.770
There are tons of incubators and
accelerators to choose from and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.960
none of them are quite the same.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.660
So it's difficult to gauge how effective
they could be for your business.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.660
Explore different options and
take some time to consider if you think

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.270
incubators or accelerators could
be right for your business.
