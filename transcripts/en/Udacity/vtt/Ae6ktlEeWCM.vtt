00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.745
[MUSIC]

00:00:06.745 --> 00:00:08.888
By using the Elsa model.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:12.320
So you want to create some events
inside of your organization.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.510
This doesn't require a lot
of permission seeking.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.710
What this requires is really
an understanding for the problem.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.840
Some small scale experiments to try to
solve the problem and then some data

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.270
that you can share and so I love this
because it uses the model in the small.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.450
You create a small event you
have some language around it and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.320
you deliver that that event
back into your organization and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.470
this will start to affect the structure.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.590
I guarantee you if you lead
with the language of change.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.990
The structure will not give way.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.680
So it's very very hard to get the kind
of agency that you that need to do

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.730
the whole thing when you haven't
started with even the very basics.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.480
So oftentimes people feel when they
share this the first response is,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.950
man I've got to do something.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.430
What I really want to do is
I want to convince people.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.070
I want to get them to
change their attitude.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.690
Well, attitude changes is good,
but it's hard.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.720
And it's maybe the least effective
in terms of how we can change

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.150
how we can move behavior.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.090
So my favorite example of this is I
wanted to become a marathon runner.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.270
So I went out and I bought the shoes and
I bought the outfit and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.080
I really developed this strong
attitude that I'm going to be awesome.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.780
And then I sat on the couch and
I ate Lucky Charms and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.740
I watched a lot of marathons in my
new shoes and my new running outfit.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.450
What changed was my attitude but
what didn't change was my behavior.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.930
And so
the event helps to shape two things.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.950
It provides language
to talk about it but

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.130
it actually gives us a vision of what
good looks like and it gets us started.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.400
I think it's BJ Fogg
who talks about this,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.790
if you want to be a runner,
you need to hire a running coach.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.260
You might need shoes too, like you might
need a cool outfit, but the first thing

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.600
you do is you need someone who's
going to show up at your house.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.590
And take you running and I think the
same idea works inside the organization.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.910
Find some small area of
improvement that you can do.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.630
Do it and then share that
result with the organization.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.560
I wouldn't go big or

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.100
broad and I wouldn't spend a lot
of time trying to convince.
