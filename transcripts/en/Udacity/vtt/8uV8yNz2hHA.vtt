00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.540
Notice that the Android TV home screen
displays games on a separate row

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.068
than apps.

00:00:05.068 --> 00:00:07.980
To make your game appear here, as well
as to have it listed as an Android TV

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.410
game on the Google Play Store,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.280
there's a couple quick updates we
need to make to your manifest.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.330
First, we'll add this line to
indicate your app is a game.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.030
Next, declare support for
game controllers.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.370
And be sure to always set
the required flag to false,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.660
even if your game requires one.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.670
This might seem a bit counterintuitive.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.170
And the reason is that game
pads are accessories and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.840
they might not be connected
at the time of purchase.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.870
So if you accidentally set
the required flag to true,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.280
users might actually have trouble
installing your game from the Play Store

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.440
if their game controller
isn't connected.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.740
If you actually do require a game pad,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.510
instead just check if it's
connected when your game starts up.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.140
As a refresher, carefully check your
manifest hardware requirements.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.480
Also pay attention to implied
hardware requirements,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.840
that can come about
because of permissions.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.490
When you find a piece of hardware that's
supported on a mobile device, but

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.030
not a TV, like a sensor,
mark it as optional.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.420
Then at runtime,
check what device you're running on, or

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.510
whether your device has a certain type
of hardware, before you try and use it.
