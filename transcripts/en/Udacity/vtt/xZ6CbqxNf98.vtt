00:00:00.338 --> 00:00:05.420
So, here is a map of a small portion of Long Island, New York. Imagine there is

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.070
an automated car that can navigate the streets of this neighborhood.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.420
It comes from the factory with these six cases bootstrapped in it. A,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.540
B, C, and so on. For the time being, assume that the car navigates it's way in

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.450
this neighborhood solely by the method of learning where the car in case is.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.215
So all it can use is this cases that is knows about. Now, suppose that we

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:30.850
have a new problem. The new problem is how to go from Q to this end destination

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.490
denoted by the arrow. What route is most similar to this new problem?
