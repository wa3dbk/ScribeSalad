00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.059
In the last few examples, we saw when rational expressions had a factor in the

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:08.450
numerator and the denominator that equaled 1. This is true for the quantity m

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.363
minus 2 divided by m minus 2. We know this fraction really equals 1. But what do

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:17.656
you think about for these expressions? What do you think these would equal?

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:19.493
Write your answer in the boxes.
