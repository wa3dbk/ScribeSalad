00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.100
So what now?

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.130
Well, if you're
an IOS Developer Nanodegree student,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.939
hopefully you've submitted your app for
grading.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.800
And maybe you got feedback, or
maybe you're still waiting.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.675
Either way, you've almost graduated and
that's really exciting so

00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:15.835
congratulations.

00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:19.045
There's just a couple more things
that you need to do before doing so.

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:22.145
If you've developed an app that
you'd like to make a business out of

00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:23.705
I will bring your attention again to

00:00:23.705 --> 00:00:26.622
the Udacity Entrepreneurship
Management Nanodegree.

00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:31.082
Which will take you through the process
of making your app profitable.

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:32.772
There's a link to it in
the instructor notes below.

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:35.952
If you've posted your
app to the app store and

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:39.062
you're just interested in monitoring
feedback and making it better

00:00:39.062 --> 00:00:42.152
there's some instructions for doing so
in the reading notes that follow.

00:00:42.152 --> 00:00:45.300
Whatever your path,
this is where I leave you.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.610
And I hope that you have had as much fun
taking this class as I had making it.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.600
And I seriously cannot wait
to see what you guys build.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.170
So, until next time.
