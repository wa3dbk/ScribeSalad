00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.950
When I think about how entrepreneur
should work with investors that

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.710
basically is broken down
between before investment and

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.190
after investment,
it's two separate stages.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.800
However, there are some common things
that entrepreneur should always keep in

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.390
mind and the first thing to keep in
mind is the across the entire process,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.250
in the entire life cycle is that
the honesty, transparency, and

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.900
openness are probably your
best tool as an entrepreneur

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.540
to keep a good relationship
with your investor.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.350
At the end of the day the investor
does not sit in the company every day.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.410
And the thing that are really
trivial and really apparent for

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.320
you as to use as an entrepreneur are not
that clear to the investor that meet

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.930
you every few weeks, or
every month, or every few month.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.530
And so when you do not update or
invest, when you're not open,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.630
when you're not transparent,
it's very easy to lose the trust.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.900
It's very easy to get to the point where
the investor feels that something's been

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.830
hidden, that it's not been you know,
it's not been fully shared and

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.160
this is really bad and that's bad from
the beginning from when you want to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.260
start creating the relationship all
the way up till you exit of the company.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.946
And you've gotta understand that
the relationship with the investor

00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:08.508
is a long term relationship.

00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:11.883
The average entrepreneur is going to
either fail within an average

00:01:11.883 --> 00:01:14.571
of 24 months,
18 to 24 months, or succeed,

00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:17.320
which is going to take an average
of four to five years.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.947
And so, this is a long term journey and
if you're going to be with somebody,

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:24.634
engaged, for four to five years,
more than most relationship in the world

00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:28.616
right, if you're going to beat that,
if you're going to be successfully doing

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:31.834
that, you really have to think
how you're building a trust based

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:35.288
relationship which is based not just
on liking each other because over

00:01:35.288 --> 00:01:38.210
time you may not necessarily
become great friends.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.525
But you need to maintain
that relationship, so

00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:42.030
that the first thing is transparency and
openness.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.380
I think that when you come as an
entrepreneur to an investor, you need to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.510
think what are the thing that
the investors would really want to see.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.570
And what the investors want to see, the
investors want to see your character,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.250
so you need to bring out your
character and who you are.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.090
The next thing that the investors
want to see is that you're serious.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.040
And being serious meaning
treating yourself seriously,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.006
treating the investors seriously,
treating the investors' time seriously,

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:07.960
coming prepared,
answering questions properly.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.085
One of the things I do is that when
somebody sends me a presentation over

00:02:11.085 --> 00:02:15.660
e-mail, before I meet
them there is like a very

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.100
tenacious process of back and
forth questions that I would send.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.830
It could have come to like you know
40 emails going back and forth.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.950
Because what I want to see is not
necessarily the answers they give me but

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.450
I want to see the seriousness
in which they're taking this.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.630
So if I ask them a question,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.630
I want to see that they come
back with a reasonable answer.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.540
And I want to see how long it takes.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.060
I'll give an example, two weeks
ago somebody wrote me an e-mail.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.250
I told them, I would love to see
the market map of this thing.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.110
And they told me, okay,
sure it's going to take us two weeks.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.050
When I got back to them and
said why is it going to take two weeks?

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.750
Are you busy with something else,
is there something that I'm missing, and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.340
they said well,
we're doing lots of things.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.080
And then you think to yourself,
if it's going to take them two weeks to

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.530
create a market map, that clearly
they should have had before, but

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.620
if it's going to take them now two
weeks to update it, to recreate it then

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.450
what's going to happen when a customer's
going to tell them I need something now.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.710
And what's going to happen if they're
going to launch something and

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.710
consumers are going to basically
tell them by their behavior

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.790
that that's not what they want.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.770
Is it also going to take them
two weeks to start moving and so

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.750
that was a very short discussion right.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.060
And so through these questions and

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.980
answers I learn not necessarily
about the business itself although

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.490
a bit of that as well but mostly about
the character of the entrepreneurs and

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.600
I'm trying to see whether they're the
kind of people that I want to invest in.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.450
And the people I want to
invest in are these stars.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.520
They're the people that have fire in
their eyes, they love when they do,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.040
they wake up in the morning and
they want to conquer the world.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.128
And the speed in which they're moving
and speed is the most important thing

00:03:46.128 --> 00:03:49.610
for an entrepreneur, the speed in which
they're moving is appropriate for

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.950
the market challenges that
they're going to tackle.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.240
And people think that speed is only for
internet companies, for app companies,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.270
but it's not true.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.450
If you want to start a medical devices
company, the speed may be different in

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.100
terms of, you're not going to
have an app out in three month.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.340
But if you're not going to move fast,

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.810
somebody else is
going to eat your lunch.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.750
And so this process is something
that tells me about entrepreneurs.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.960
And I think that entrepreneurs need to
think very carefully about how they

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.680
present themselves, and how ready
they come and how fast they can move

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.680
in the interaction with the investor,
if they really want to get the money.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.880
And you know on the speed side, my
partner James likes giving what I think

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.970
is the best analogy for speed, which I
think entrepreneurs would enjoy, and

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.570
that is that when you are playing
chess against a grand master,

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.700
then you don't stand a chance, right
there you know there are geniuses, but

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.560
even I play pretty average chess,
if you let me do take two moves for

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.570
every move of the master,
I'm going to win.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.670
Because that's just the way it is, and
when you're a young company the only

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.460
thing you have as your weapons against
the large corporates is your speed.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.340
They have more people, they have more
energy, they have more money, they can

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.400
market harder, they can do whatever
they want but they are moving slow.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.730
And so as a startup if you do
not move at least twice as fast

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.910
as the large corporates
you're not going to win.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.310
So you know, that's what into
entrepreneurs need to be ready in

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.790
general for and that's what I'm looking
for and that's what they need to be able

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.250
to present to investors because all the
smart investors more than anything else,

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.470
they would look at character and
speed, these are the two things.
