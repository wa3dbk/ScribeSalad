00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.312
So, here we have our two scatter plots. It kind of looks like the older you

00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:09.556
are, the more on time you'll arrive at the party. Let's pretend that this is

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:14.554
the line that best approximates the data. Then we would guess that if you're

00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:19.775
about 70 years old, you're more likely to arrive right on time. But if you're

00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:25.030
about 20 years old, you're more likely to arrive an hour late. With age and

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.206
number of pets, it's really dfficult to see if there's a trend going on here.

00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:34.916
But it definitely looks like it's positive, maybe something like that. The

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:39.806
older you are, the more pets you tend to have. Let's use the Pearson function

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:46.613
for Google Spreadsheets to calculate R for each. What is R here and here?
