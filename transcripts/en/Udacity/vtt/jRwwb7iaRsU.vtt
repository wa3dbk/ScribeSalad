00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.520
We're almost at the end of this lesson. In the

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.520
next two lessons we're going to talk about two main families

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.800
of testing techniques, black-box testing

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.340
techniques, and white-box testing techniques. So,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.730
what I want to do before getting into the discussion of the

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.385
specific techniques in this families. I want to give you an

00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:19.440
overview of what black-box testing and white-box testing are. Black box

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.950
testing is the kind of testing in which we consider the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.570
software as a closed box. That's why it's called black box.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.770
So we don't look inside the software, we don't want to

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.131
look at the code. We just going to look at the description

00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:33.210
of the software. So this is the testing that is based

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.100
on a description of the software, which is what we normally

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.690
call the specification for the software. And what black box testing

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.040
tries to do is to cover as much specified behavior as

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.290
possible, and the main limitation black box testing and the reason

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.540
why this is complimentary to white-box testing is that it cannot reveal

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.590
errors due to implementation details. Conversely, white-box testing

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.430
is the kind of testing that looks inside the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.360
box. So looks at the code and how

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.760
the code is written and uses this information to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.300
perform the testing. So white-box testing is based

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.120
on the code, its goal is to cover as

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.210
much coded behavior in this case, as possible, and

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.100
its limitation is that unlike black-box testing, it can't

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.880
reveal errors due to missing paths. Where missing paths are

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.250
a part of a software specification that are not implemented and

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.320
the reason why you can not reveal them is because

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.790
it is focused on the code and not on the specification.
