00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.969
So we have seen in most of our
examples that we have used pages of

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.060
four kilobytes, and in the most recent
quiz we have used larger pages.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.110
So how do we choose the page size that
we're going to support in our processor?

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.970
So comparing smaller
pages to larger pages,

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.290
larger pages are good because they
will result in a smaller page table.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.590
The page table needs
to have one entry for

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.490
each page that we are using in
the case of multi-level pages.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.830
So, if pages are larger, we would
have fewer entries in our page table.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.230
Smaller pages will suffer
from large page tables.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.930
So it seems like larger pages are good,
but

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.710
we can only give memory to
applications in units of pages.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.300
So if you have a very large page,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.230
we will suffer from what is
called internal fragmentation.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.070
Internal fragmentation occurs when
the application requests some amount of

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.280
space, let's say this much, but we can
only give it space in terms of pages,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.860
so we end up giving it, for example,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.280
two pages, where this space in this page
is not really used by the application.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.010
That means that whenever this
page is actually in memory,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.670
it is going to be using actual
physical memory, although in fact

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.840
only this much of it is being
used by the application, so

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.520
this much physical memory is going to be
wasted whenever this page is in memory.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.260
When the page is on disk, this is also
wasted because we store the whole page

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.890
on disk, but
this is maybe less of a problem

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.380
because the disk is usually much
larger than the physical memory.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.750
So how do we choose the page size?

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.040
Well, obviously,
we want smaller page tables but

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.510
we don't want to suffer from too
much internal fragmentation, so,

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.710
just like with the block sizing caches,
we want to reach a compromise.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.970
And it turns out that the good
compromises are at page sizes from

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.310
a few kB to a few MB.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.810
That is why x86 processors
use a 4kB page.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.700
At the time when they were designed,
the bias was slightly more toward

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.180
the smaller pages because we were so
worried about wasting memory.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.420
Nowadays, waste of memory even
with megabyte sized pages

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.780
is relatively small compared
to the overall memory size, so

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.740
if we were designing
a processor nowadays,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.788
probably the page size would be closer
to a megabyte than to a 4kB page.
