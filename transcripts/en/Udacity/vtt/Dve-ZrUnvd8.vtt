00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.080
Cortés makes it easy to roll out updates
to your applications by modifying

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.320
the deployments and managing them.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.370
It's major update time.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.030
Let's modify the off deployment
configuration file to use Version 2.0

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.350
of the author container image.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.790
Now will apply or
update using the coup apply command.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.879
We can track the progress of our of
the plumbing using the COO CTO describe

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:24.584
deployments

00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:26.147
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:26.147 --> 00:00:27.950
Let's walk through
the output of this command.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.390
Here's our only update strategy.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.870
This ensures that the right number
of PAs are always available.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.330
Once the rolling update is complete
we can view the running pads for

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.010
the off service.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.980
Here we see the new replica
said that's being used

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.240
to ensure that we are running the latest
version of our off container.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.020
Once the rolling update is complete
we can view the running path for

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.650
the off service.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.560
Notice how long they have been running.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.650
The new version of the off Pod
have replaced the previous ones.

00:00:57.985 --> 00:01:01.845
We can verify that the off Pod
is running the new version of

00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:04.724
the off container using
the COO CTO described command.

00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:09.825
Updating deployments this way keeps us
with a clean declarative approach for

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:13.277
rolling out update Kubernetes
makes it easy to roll out changes

00:01:13.277 --> 00:01:16.027
to our applications using
a declarative approach.

00:01:16.027 --> 00:01:19.097
Whether you have 1 or
100 pause in a deployment,

00:01:19.097 --> 00:01:22.707
Kubernetes makes it easy to update
them using a few simple commands.
