00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.695
Now here's the important part, our equation started off balanced, and then we

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:10.206
changed it. We tried to complete the square, by adding an amount. And in this

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:15.827
case we didn't just add 16, we really added 2 times that, or 32. So, we need to

00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:20.462
do something in order to get this equation back and balance. Since we added 32

00:00:20.462 --> 00:00:24.474
to the right, we could also add 32 to the left, but I really don't want to do

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:28.758
this since eventually I just want to get y alone or isolated on one side of the

00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:36.464
equation. So, what operation should we perform here and the same operation here

00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:41.936
in order to make our equation balanced? As a hint think about what you would

00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:46.110
need to do in order to make this equation not change.
