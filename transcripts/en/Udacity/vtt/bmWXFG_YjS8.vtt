00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.530
In ESP the IP header
is not authenticated.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.900
So what if we want to
authenticate the entire packet?

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.560
We can use authentication header or.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.870
There are several fields
in the IP header.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.300
For example, time to live or TTL,
that may change in transmission.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.370
The values of these fields
are not included, or

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.300
zero out when the message
authentication code is computed.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.490
Does not encrypt anything, but we can
use ESP to encrypt the payload and

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.890
then apply To authenticate
the entire packet.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.020
If Is used with transport mode, the
authentication code is in the Header,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.840
which is inserted after the origin or
IP header.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.420
Other important IP set
information in the Header

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.270
includes the security parameter
index and a sequence number.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.377
And again,
we will discuss these shortly.

00:00:56.377 --> 00:01:02.150
If Is used with tunnel mode, the Header
is inserted after the new IP header.
