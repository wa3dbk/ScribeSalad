00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.167
So now I really went to art school. I

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:06.366
thank Amy for the Greece drawing. So what does it

00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.300
take to make a network like this work? So

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.470
let's suppose we wanted to send a message from Rhodes

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.440
to Sparta, and we have many points along the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.010
way where we can send smoke signals. So we'd start

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.510
by sending a smoke signal from Rhodes. This would be

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.620
visible from a few other points. And to reach Sparta,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.890
the one at Naxos would need to resend it,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.700
would need to also submit it as smoke signal

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.210
that would be visible at some other points. The

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.950
one at Melos would need to see it and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.360
resend it. And maybe that's already visible at Sparta.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.740
So we need several different things in order to

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.260
make a network like this work. The first thing

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.690
we need is a way to encode messages. We need

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.910
to be able to convert the message that we want

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.900
to send, say it's a message that says the Trojans are

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.090
arriving. We needed to be able to send that message and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.580
encode that in a smoke signal. We need a way to

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.130
do routing. We need to figure out where the message should

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.350
go. If we want to send it to Sparta, we need to

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.980
know that it should be forwarded by these nodes. The node

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.790
that sees it from Miletus does not need to resend it.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.890
Probably the way the ancient Greek network worked, all the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.290
nodes resent every message. They didn't have a way to do

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.390
routing selectively. But that's very wasteful. What we'd like is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.020
a way to only send the message to the destination it

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.580
goes to. For the kinds of messages the ancient Greeks

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.080
were sending that says things like the enemy's arriving, well, it

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.720
was okay. You wanted to send it everywhere, that's called

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.950
flooding the net. But if we want to send messages just

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.185
between two points, we've got to know which nodes should

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:48.960
resend the message or which direction to send it in. And

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.080
the final thing we need to worry about is, we need

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.950
to decide who gets to use the network. So it might

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.810
be that there are more than one enemy arriving at once

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.340
or maybe, the enemy is arriving, it might be at the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.510
same time. Achilles, say Achilles is in Melos, and he wants

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.210
to send a message back to Medea in Delphi. So maybe

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.630
Achilles wants to send a message that would go like this at

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.370
the same time as the army needing to send this important message

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.810
that's saying the Trojans are arriving. So we need to figure out

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.840
who gets to use the network and what they get to send.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.490
So, these are all things the ancient Greek network would have had

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.590
to deal with if it was sophisticated enough to worry about them.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.680
If it was just sending the message that says the troops are

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.960
arriving, well, that's one smoke signal and it didn't necessarily need that.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.700
All of these are the same things that we need to

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.480
worry about if we want to send messages on the internet. So

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.726
these are the things that we need to make any network.

00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:44.200
We need some way to take the messages that we want to

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.630
send and encode them in a way that they can be

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.446
transmitted, and interpret them when they get to that other end. For

00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:54.538
the Greeks, the message was something like, Agamemnon is arriving, get the

00:02:54.538 --> 00:02:58.080
ships to a safe place. And they needed to encode that in

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.450
a smoke signal. We need a way to route messages.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.790
We need a way for the receiver of this smoke

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.310
signal to know the next place to send it. And

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.490
for the Ancient Greek network, since smoke signals are not directional,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.870
they just go up in the air, there wasn't much

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.930
to do here. Everyone could see the message and they

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.420
wanted to send the message everywhere. If we want to send

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.430
messages just between two points, this becomes a much tougher problem.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.540
We need rules for deciding who gets to use resources.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.160
If there are two messages that want to go through the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.810
same place, well, only one of those can be sent at

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.490
a time. We need some way to decide when. For the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.220
Greeks, well, I don't know what their rules were, but let's

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.920
assume their rule was, if you're a general, your message has

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.650
priority. We needed all these same things for the Internet. Before

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.650
we talk about how they are done on the Internet, I

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.630
am going to introduce the two main ways that we measure networks.
