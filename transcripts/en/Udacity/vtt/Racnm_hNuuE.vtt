00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.400
Trojan Horses get their name from
a tale from the Trojan Wars.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.160
It is said that the Greeks wanted to
enter the well fortified city of Troy.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.550
Rather than launching a direct assault
at the city and suffering huge losses,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.700
they devised a wooden horse and they
hid their soldiers inside the horse.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.610
Then the left the horse out side
the gates of Troy as a gift.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.050
The Trojans thought the horse
as a gift to acknowledge that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.200
the Greeks had been defeated.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.500
And so they brought the horse
into the city of Troy.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.340
At night, the Greek soldiers
hidden in the horse came out.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.280
And they let their fellow
soldiers waiting outside the city

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.860
come in as well.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.230
As a result, the Greek soldiers
passed all of Troy's defenses, and

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.800
destroyed the city, and won the war.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.290
In the context of malware,
a Trojan horse is a piece

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.780
malicious code embedded in a utility
program that a user will run frequently.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.540
That is, when a user runs this
useful program, the malicious code,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.270
or the Trojan horse is also executing.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.250
An example of a Trojan Horse is a login
program that performs key logging

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.772
meaning stealing user login and
password and

00:01:09.772 --> 00:01:14.040
pass along such confidential
information to an internet server.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.110
The login program will still allow the
user to log in by calling the real login

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.290
subroutine because otherwise
the user would notice.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.960
Many malicious browser extensions or
also perform key logging and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.940
phishing, in addition to
some useful functions and

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.380
these are the latest
examples of Trojan Horses.
