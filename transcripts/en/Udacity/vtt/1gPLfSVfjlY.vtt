00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.370
In this lesson we're going to finish
our implementation of core data and

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.100
see how it works its magic.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.280
We'll also look at how our
table knows what to display.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.170
How a user can add a new note, and most
importantly how we actually save and

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.890
persist these changes.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.350
We'll also see the important role core
data plays in memory management, and

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.800
we may even hear from a few
time traveling friends.
