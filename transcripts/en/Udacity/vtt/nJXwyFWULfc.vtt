00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.352
I said we wouldn't always be working with square roots, sometimes we can work

00:00:03.352 --> 00:00:07.930
with a cube root. When we take a cube root, we're really trying to find triples

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.680
of a factor that are underneath the radical sign. In other words, we need a

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.767
factor raised to the 3rd power underneath here in order to remove it from the

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:20.426
radical symbol since it's a cube root. We can think of cube roots as a side

00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:25.372
length of cube with a given volume. For example, if this cube has a volume of

00:00:25.372 --> 00:00:29.662
8, you want to find the side lengths that multiply together three times to give

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:34.984
us 8. So, what do you think are the side lengths for each of these cubes? Keep

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:38.766
in mind that the side lengths of a cube are equal, and the volume can be found

00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:43.113
by multiplying the same number together three times.
