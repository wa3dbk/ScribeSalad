00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So let's look at just one more example.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We're going to be testing some sort of a graphical application.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So we have a GUI application that's our software under test.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And so we have to ask ourselves what's the domain and range 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of a graphical user application?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The domain--that is to say, the set of legal inputs--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is basically just going to be the set of all possible GUI actions,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so mouse clicks, keyboard events, swipes, etc.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And the range is going to be possible states of the GUI application.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So now it should go without saying that the size of the domain here--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that is to say, the size of the set of all possible GUI inputs--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is really pretty gigantic.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
There are a lot of possible combinations of inputs.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And so now I have a quiz question for you.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The question is what constitutes a set of good test inputs for a GUI application?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Answer a) is just use the application normally.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Answer b) is let a 4-year-old use the application for a while.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Answer c) is use some sort of a tool to inject a stream of fake GUI events--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that is to say, a stream of automatically generated keyboard events,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
mouse clicks, and similar.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And answer d) is reproduce GUI inputs--that is to say, mouse clicks and such--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that crashed our previous version of our software.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So go ahead and write all of the answers that apply in the text box here.
