00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.052
Okay. Having just introduced these five quality metrics that we're

00:00:03.052 --> 00:00:05.180
going to be looking at, I'd like you to spend

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.770
a little time thinking about each one of them. And

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.220
as an exercise, think about relative to one another, which

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.770
are more difficult. I'd like you to rank these in

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.750
order of difficulty from 1 to 5. With 1 being

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.000
the most difficult, 5 being the least difficult, in terms

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.210
of how difficult they might be to detect in our

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.810
data and fix. So again, just put a number in each one

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.910
of these boxes, 1 to 5. Put a 1 next to the one

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.770
of these you think is the most difficult to work with, and 5

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.970
next to the one you think is the least difficult to work with.
