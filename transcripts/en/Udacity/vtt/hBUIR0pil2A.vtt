Fix the intent call, to lauch our detail activity, by pulling

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.830
data from the cursor and using our formatting utility functions to

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.180
build our EXTRA_TEXT string. We can use the adapter to get

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.430
our cursor. This adapter is passed into our On Item click listener.
