00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.732
The vertex is at negative 5 halves, negative 1 4th. Please note that x plus 5

00:00:05.732 --> 00:00:11.283
halves is the same as x minus negative 5 halves and y plus 1 over 4 is the same

00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:16.096
as y minus negative 1 4th. So, that is why these are the coordinate of the

00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:16.664
vertex.
