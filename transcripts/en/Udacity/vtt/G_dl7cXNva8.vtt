00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.320
Go ahead and update the save profile method

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.320
in conference API to save the profile entity in

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.189
the data store. You can look for the place

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.080
marked TODO 3 in the save profile method and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.780
that's where you add the code to save the

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.540
entity. When you've added the code, go ahead and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.260
run your app on localhost and then go to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.510
the API's explorer and execute the save profile method.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.210
Use the API's explorer to try out the updated

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.240
save profile function. You'll see the responses you did

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.300
before but you'll need to go to the admin

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.730
console to check that the profile entity was saved

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.320
in the data store. And just a reminder, to

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.850
get to the admin console on localhost, you go

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.320
to localhost colon port number like localhost colon ADAT

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.570
and then you type underscore Slash ADMIN. What properties

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.820
does your profile entity show in the admin console? Check each one that applies.
