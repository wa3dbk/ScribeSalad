00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.613
So we've seen some really interesting algorithms so far,

00:00:02.613 --> 00:00:06.685
but the GPU performance leader is none of the ones that we've discussed to date.

00:00:06.685 --> 00:00:11.023
Instead, typically on the GPU for the highest performing sorts

00:00:11.023 --> 00:00:13.891
we use a different sorting algorithm called radix sort.

00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:18.133
Now, all of the previous sorting algorithms were comparison sorts,

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:21.415
meaning the only operation we did on an item was compare it to another one.

00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:25.451
Radix sort relies on a number representation that uses positional notation.

00:00:25.451 --> 00:00:29.779
In this case, bits are more significant as we move further left in the word,

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.689
and it's most easily explained using integers.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.461
So the algorithm for radix sort is as follows.

00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:40.685
Start with the least significant bit of the integer, split the input into 2 sets,

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:45.472
those that have a 0 with this particular bit location and those that have a 1.

00:00:45.472 --> 00:00:47.457
Otherwise, maintain the order.

00:00:47.457 --> 00:00:51.988
Then proceed to the next least significant bit and repeat until we run out of bits.

00:00:51.988 --> 00:00:55.514
So as usual, we're going to do an example that will make more sense,

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:57.904
and we're going to use unsigned integers.

00:00:57.904 --> 00:01:01.059
So what we're going to sort is this column of numbers to the left,

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.438
and here is the binary representation of those numbers.

00:01:04.438 --> 00:01:08.746
And so we're going to start here with the least significant bit.

00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:14.740
So the way that we're going to do this is take all the elements that have a 0 as the least significant bit,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.819
and we're going to otherwise maintain their order, but we're going to put them up top.

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.220
Then we're going to take all the rest of the elements,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.928
those that have a 1 as the least significant bit,

00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:27.728
and we're going to again keep them in order and append them to the list that we've just created.

00:01:27.728 --> 00:01:31.172
So what this creates is a list where all the least significant bits are 0

00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:34.571
and then a list where all the least significant bits is 1.

00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:37.491
Now we move to the next least significant bit,

00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:40.150
so the bit in the middle, and we're going to do the same thing.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.447
We're going to take all the 0s and put them up top,

00:01:42.447 --> 00:01:44.905
and then we're going to take all the 1s and put them below.

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:48.035
And here the dotted lines are just showing the data movement that we're looking at.

00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:51.019
The green lines are the ones where the middle bits are 0,

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:53.787
and the blue line is the one where the middle bits are 1.

00:01:53.787 --> 00:01:56.394
Now we move on to the next most significant bit--

00:01:56.394 --> 00:02:00.269
in this case, the very most significant bit--and we do the same operation again.

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:03.968
Zeroes in the most significant bit move up top, 1s move to the bottom,

00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:06.060
otherwise, we maintain the order.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.907
And now we have a sorted sequence. Pretty cool, huh?

00:02:08.907 --> 00:02:12.117
Now, there's 2 big reasons this code runs great on GPUs.

00:02:12.117 --> 00:02:17.477
The first is its work complexity. The best comparison base sorts are O(n log n).

00:02:17.477 --> 00:02:20.577
This algorithm, on the other hand, is O(kn),

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:23.566
meaning the runtime is linear in 2 different things.

00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:27.027
First, it's linear in the number of bits in the representation.

00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:31.940
So this particular integer has 3 bits in its representation,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.643
and it took 3 stages for us to be able to sort the input.

00:02:35.643 --> 00:02:38.604
Second, it's linear in the number of items to sort.

00:02:38.604 --> 00:02:41.796
So we have 8 items in the representation here,

00:02:41.796 --> 00:02:45.674
and so the amount of work is proportional to 8.

00:02:45.674 --> 00:02:51.718
Generally k is constant, say a 32-bit word or a 64-bit word for any reasonable applications.

00:02:51.718 --> 00:02:54.433
And so in general, the work complexity of this

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:58.160
is mostly proportional to the number of items that we need to sort.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.986
And so that's a superior work complexity to any of the sorts that we've talked about to date,

00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:05.762
and so that's 1 reason why this looks so good.

00:03:05.762 --> 00:03:11.540
The second is that the underlying operations that we need to do this split of the input at each step

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.306
are ones that are actually very efficient.

00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:17.677
And in fact, they're efficient operations that you already know.

00:03:17.677 --> 00:03:19.638
Let's take a closer look at what we're doing.

00:03:19.638 --> 00:03:23.280
We're only going to look at the first stage of the radix sort algorithm,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.817
where we're only considering the value of the least significant bit,

00:03:26.817 --> 00:03:31.516
and we're only going to look at the output for which the least significant bit is 0.

00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:34.327
Now what are we actually doing here?

00:03:34.327 --> 00:03:37.427
We've already learned an algorithm that does this operation today.

00:03:37.427 --> 00:03:42.477
So what is the name of the algorithm that takes this input and creates that as the output?
