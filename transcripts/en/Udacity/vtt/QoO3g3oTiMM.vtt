00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.500
&gt;&gt; So we can actually work out what the VC

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.540
dimension of a finite H is and, in fact, it's easier

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.120
to just think about it in terms of an upper

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.300
bound. So, let's, let's imagine that the VC dimension of H

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.020
is some number, D. And the thing to realize from

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.870
that, is that, that implies that there has to be at

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.270
least two to the d distinct concepts. Why is that? Is

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.360
because each of the two to the d different labelings is

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.530
going to be captured by a distinct hypothesis in the class, because

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.280
if we can't use the same hypothesis to get two different labelings. So

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.260
that means that the, that two to the d is going to be less

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.860
than or equal to the number of hypotheses. It could be that there's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.370
more, but there can't be any fewer, otherwise we wouldn't be able

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.950
to get things shattered. So, just you know, simple manipulation here, gives us

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.000
that d is less than or equal to the log base 2 of

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.425
h, so there is this logarithmic relationship, between the size of a finite

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:52.815
hyptothesis class. And the VC dimension of it,

00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:54.880
and again, that's what we were seeing in

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.656
the other direction as well, that the, that the log of the hypo, size of the

00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:00.898
hypothesis space was kind of playing the role

00:01:00.898 --> 00:01:03.370
of the VC dimension in, in the bound.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.950
Okay, that makes sense. And, and from that,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.270
it's easy to see how 13 got in there.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.580
&gt;&gt; Yes. It should be pretty much obvious

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.170
to even the most casual observer of 13.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.990
&gt;&gt; Yes, I think that's right. So I don't

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.530
think there's any reason for us to explain it.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think one would have to really go back and look at the, at the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.190
proof to get the details of why the, it has the form that it has, but, or at

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.670
least the details of the form. The, the, the,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.560
overall structure of the form, I think we understand.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.080
It's just that the details come out of the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.200
proof and we're not going to go through the proof.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.970
&gt;&gt; And I think that's probably best for everyone.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.230
&gt;&gt; So what, what we're seeing at the moment is that

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.630
a finite hypothesis class or a finite VC dimension, give us finite

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.200
bounds, and therefore make things PAC-learnable. What's kind of amazing though

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.615
is that there's a general theorem that says, in general, if H is

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:55.870
PAC-learnable if and only if the VC dimension is finite. So

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.720
that means that, we know that anything that

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.160
has finite VC dimension is learnable from the previous

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.070
bound. But we're saying that it's actually the other

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.650
way as well, that if something is learnable it

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.490
has finite VC dimension. Or to say it another

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.758
way, if it has infinite VC dimension, you can't

00:02:10.758 --> 00:02:16.690
learn it. VC dimension captures, in one quantity, the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.430
notion of PAC-learnability, which is, which is really beautiful.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. That V and that C guy, they're pretty smart.
