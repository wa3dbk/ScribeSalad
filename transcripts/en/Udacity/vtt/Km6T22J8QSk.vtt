00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Accuracy is an obvious issue with our computer-based solution.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
To check what the computer does, the easiest way to learn

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
what goes wrong with the computer simulation is to use a toy example,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which we can compute by hand as well.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This toy example will be a circular orbit.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A space craft moving around earth for instance with the earth at the center of this orbit.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's call the radius of that orbit r and let's call the orbital period

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the time its takes for one orbit capital T.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The velocity vector of that spacecraft will be tangential to that orbit

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and the speed that is the length of that velocity vector.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The speed will be constant and we can't easily compute the speed.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It takes the spacecraft amount of time, capital T, to go around that circumference

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and the time capital T, the distance traveled by the space craft is 2 πr circumference of that orbit.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The acceleration vector of these points perpendicular

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to that orbit to the center of the earth.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The acceleration does not change the speed, the length of the velocity vector that is,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it simply changes the direction of that vector.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We can compute the length of that acceleration vector in a similar fashion. This goes as follows.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We start with the velocity vector that takes us up

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and then we move and then the velocity vector changes to the left.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
At this point, it points to the left and eventually it goes round to full circle.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
After one orbital period, it's going to be that blue vector again with phase shift of 90°.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So we can't say that the velocity vector executes the same circular motion

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
as does the position vector that we have a phase shift of 90° between them.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Nonetheless, we can still apply the same equation.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It takes us one orbital period to make one full revolution and that has a length of 2 π*r.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
All of these vectors have the length of 2 πr/T.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So the circumference would be 2π times this radius 2 πr/T, which boils down to (2π)² r/T².

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So given the radius and the orbital period of this circular motion,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
we can determine what the speed is and what the acceleration is.
