00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.980
So Google Analytics
provides a dashboard where

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.260
you can see information about
how people are using your app.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.660
So here in the overview page,
we see how many users.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.495
How many new users we've
had in the past month.

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:14.830
400 not too bad.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.840
Active users, 1,200, so that's
the new users and the previous users.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.840
We can see where in the world
people are using our app, and

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.140
we can see what devices
they're using to use the app.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.498
So we can drill down a little bit
more into some of these details.

00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:33.202
So, for example, where in the world.

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:37.171
We can, like, really drill down,
we can see how many people, oh,

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:40.180
we have 770 in New Zealand right now.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.140
Oh, one in Madagascar, and then we
can get the actual data for it too.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.130
So, we get the numbers.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.450
And this app that we're using here
was developed by my friend, Ian,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.020
Ian Lake, and you've probably seen him
in the Android fundamentals two course.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.970
We can look into the language
that people are using.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.080
In this case it's predominantly English,
but

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.190
we do have Portuguese,
we do have some French users.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.550
So we can drill down more into
the devices that people are using.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.450
So here we see all
the different devices.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.180
And we can see the percentage of
the popularity of the devices.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.550
So, the Galaxy S5 was the most
popular recognized device.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.370
Some of the unrecognized
devices include the emulator,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.030
as well as devices that
Analytics didn't recognize.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.990
You can see the top network operators.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.942
We can even see the screen
resolutions that people used.

00:01:33.942 --> 00:01:35.240
The branding.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.200
One of the really cool things I can
show you is the real time data.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.750
You can actually see how many people
are using your app right now.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.780
And actually I have to be honest.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.310
It's not really right now.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.210
It's close to right now.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.450
So it's close to real time.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.790
You can see the top locations
where people are using the app.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.180
So somebody down here in Melbourne
is actually using the app right now.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.780
We have people in Peru using it.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.270
We have people in
the Philippines using it.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.660
We can see what they're
looking at right now.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.420
And of course, you know, one of the main
things you do want to know about your

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.580
app is, what parts of
the app are the users using.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.740
You get that through the screens.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.510
So this is not the real time data,
this is overall in the last month.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.750
We can see all the screens,
which screens the users went to, and

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.190
a screen is equivalent to an activity.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.050
We see obviously, that the main
screen is where people went the most.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.870
And then you can see, you know,
where else they went in the app.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.950
You can also follow through the flow of
how people navigated through the app.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.810
So, you can see where they started,
where they went to next, and so on.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.350
So, I hope I've convinced you that
Analytics can give you all kinds of

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.030
awesome information about how and
where you're apps being used.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.510
And now, I'm going to talk you through
how you can update your apps, so

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.320
that you can get all this
awesome kind of information

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.950
about how your app is being used.
