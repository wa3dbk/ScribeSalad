00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.207
We explored some of the US laws
that have been developed for

00:00:04.207 --> 00:00:09.235
dealing with cyber crime and
theft of proprietary online information.

00:00:09.235 --> 00:00:12.880
Now these laws could be different
across different countries.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.280
But one thing we saw is that enforcing
them has some serious challenges.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.290
We also discussed ethical behavior

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.280
when it comes to our online activities
that impact cyber security.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.282
In the end, we explored online privacy.

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:36.832
In particular, who can collect
information about what we do online?

00:00:36.832 --> 00:00:40.230
What can they do with such information?

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.220
Who can they share it with?

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.770
And what options do we
have in the use and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.290
sharing of information about
our online activities?
