00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.640
For the visualization, countries and player were encoding along the x axis.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.570
Time encoded along the y axis.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.920
Goals Scored was encoded by the size of the circles.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.510
And the Top Scorer was encoded by color hue, which was yellow.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.290
And now, let's see on the graphic.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.210
We can see that time is encoded along the y axis.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.460
Country and player is encoded along the x axis.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.620
The number of goals is encoded by the size of the circles,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.270
indicated by this legend and

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.630
the top score is indicated by color hue, which in this case is yellow.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.910
Now I know this might seem trivial, but these were deliberate choices.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.920
The person who designed this graphic,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.380
thought very carefully about the most important variables.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.320
And how to place them in the graphic, and represent them visually.
