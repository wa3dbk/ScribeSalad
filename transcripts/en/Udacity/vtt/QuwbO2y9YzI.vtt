00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.740
So now that we know that cache blocks
need to be at aligned memory addresses,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.120
let's look at what the memory and
cache look like in terms of blocks.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.800
Our memory can be seen as just
a huge array of memory locations.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.080
Let's say this is location number 0.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.190
And let's say that each
location is 4 bytes wide.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.090
So the next location is at address 4.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.120
And then 8, and so on.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.690
Let's say that our
block size is 16 bytes.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.020
That means that a possible
block in memory is this.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.930
This would be the first block.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.060
This would be the second block.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.330
This would be the third block,
and so on.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.880
A cache, then, can be considered to be
a number of slots where a block can fit.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.930
In this case,
we have just a two-block cache.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.810
So, the cache size is just
equal to two block sizes.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.130
So memory has blocks of data,
and our cache

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.080
has lines which are basically
slots where a block can fit.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.040
We can say, for example,
that block number 0 can be

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.380
fetched into the cache and
placed in line number 0.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.060
So when we want to make
a precise distinction between

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.150
the space in the cache where
we can put a block and

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.810
the actual memory content we put there,
the space in the cache is called a line.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.840
And the stuff we put
there is called a block.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.620
The line size and
the block size are the same.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.830
So a line is effectively a slot
where a block might fit.
