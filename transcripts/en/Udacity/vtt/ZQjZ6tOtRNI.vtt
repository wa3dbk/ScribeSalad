00:00:00.073 --> 00:00:04.776
To wrap up, today we learned about not only that the world is becoming parallel but why.

00:00:04.776 --> 00:00:09.980
The GPU is a processor that takes advantage of some of the most important technical trends in computing.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.917
We looked at our first CUDA program,

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:15.254
learned how it worked, and changed the program to do something new.

00:00:15.254 --> 00:00:19.525
Now for our first project, we're going to use CUDA to input a color image,

00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:21.493
and output that image in grayscale.

00:00:21.493 --> 00:00:25.202
This will involve a map operation over every pixel in the image,

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:28.290
where the operation on each pixel is converting the input color

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.258
in red, green, and blue to a single intensity value.

00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:33.695
When you're done, you'll have the chance to show your grandparents

00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:37.793
what your new photos would've looked like back in the day, or at least that's what I'm going to do.

00:00:37.793 --> 00:00:42.478
Enjoy the assignment, and I hope you enjoy an excellent presentation from Dave for Unit 2.
