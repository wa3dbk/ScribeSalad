00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.981
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Take a second to look at the answers that I've written here. The two that I

00:00:03.981 --> 00:00:07.949
personally get most confused about are the two that end up with less than or

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:12.287
equal to signs in the answers. Saying that Grant wants to employ no more than 15

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:16.571
staff means that he can employ any number of people up to 15, but then can't go

00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:21.016
any higher than that. So 15 is the highest number he can employ, and then he can

00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:25.454
also pick any number less than that. Similarly, if Grant will pay at most $5 per

00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:29.387
week, it means he can pay any amount up to $5. So this is the same sort of

00:00:29.387 --> 00:00:31.307
relation as in the other problem.
