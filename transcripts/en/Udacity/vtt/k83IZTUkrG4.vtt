00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.404
Before telling you what the right answer is, let

00:00:02.404 --> 00:00:04.240
me remind you that the fault is related to

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.508
the code, and is a necessary, but not sufficient

00:00:06.508 --> 00:00:09.560
condition for the occurrence of a failure. So in this

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.450
case, a single faulty line is responsible for the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.435
failure, which is line three. So the correct answer, is

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:20.700
three. At line three, the program computes i times

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.080
i, instead of i times 2, as it should do.
