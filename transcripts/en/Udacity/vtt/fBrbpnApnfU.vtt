00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.640
When we go through this long division we end up with x squared plus x plus 1.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.873
You'll remember that you actually have seen this problem before when you

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:12.668
learned how to factor, we learned a rule for factoring difference of cubes. We

00:00:12.668 --> 00:00:16.877
learned that x cubed minus 1 is equal to x minus 1 times x squared plus x plus

00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:20.563
1. Now we just proved that rule, awesome.
