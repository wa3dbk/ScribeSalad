00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:01.900
Final project time!

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.104
Now, you get to dig in and
make something awesome.

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:09.539
Given the nature of these platforms,
we've kept this project pretty flexible.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.967
But make sure to read the project
requirements carefully before jumping in

00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:18.688
and remember, your app should provide
a unified, seamless user experience.

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:22.271
It should feel natural,
moving from one form factor to another,

00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:24.300
with appropriate features on each.
