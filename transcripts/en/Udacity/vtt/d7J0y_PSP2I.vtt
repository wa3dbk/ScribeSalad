00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.285
&gt;&gt; This one is true, especially for large data sets. In each of these samples,

00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:10.159
our sample size is only 10. So here we don't exactly have 50 percent of the

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:15.373
data, but it's pretty close. And this will more and more closely approximate 50

00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:20.566
percent as the data set gets larger. Think of it this way. We split the data in

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:26.797
half. We split it in half. And we split it in half here. If this is 25 percent,

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:32.070
this is another 25 percent, another 25 percent, and another. Then here between

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.160
Q1 and Q3, we'll have about 50 percent. This one's false. We could make this one

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.121
a lot bigger, and the IQR would still be the same. However, we could change this

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:51.653
if we made it, say, 59,000. Then the IQR would get a little bigger. If we made

00:00:51.653 --> 00:01:00.443
54,135 bigger than 60,181, then this would be the new Q3. So sometimes certain

00:01:00.443 --> 00:01:05.242
values can influence the IQR, but it's not affected by every value in the data

00:01:05.242 --> 00:01:10.892
set. And the same concept applies here. We have this outlier, but even if this

00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:16.568
were something closer to the data set, like 63,000, the IQR would still stay the

00:01:16.568 --> 00:01:18.516
same. So this one's true.
