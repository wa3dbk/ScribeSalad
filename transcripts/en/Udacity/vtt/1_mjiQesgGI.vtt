00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.080
One of the consequences of Moore's Law and the performance improvements that

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.600
we expect to follow is the so-called memory wall. Here's why we have it.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.870
The processor speed in terms of instructions per second we have already said is,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.640
can be expected to roughly double every, let's say two years. Memory capacity,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.480
which is how many gigabytes of memory can we have in the same size module,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.750
is also doubling every two years. But

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.180
memory latency, that is how long does it take to do a memory operation,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.030
has only been improving about 1.1 times every two years.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.330
So over time, as years go by, if we plot the speed of processors and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.630
memory, we get something like this, an exponential curve for the processors.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.090
And we get another exponential curve, but that grows a lot slower, for

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.800
memories. This here is the gap between processor performance and

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.319
memory performance at some time and then several years later,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:10.630
we have a much wider gap. This problem is often called the memory wall.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.919
Basically, our processors are getting a lot faster than memories are, yet

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:20.047
they have to access memory every so many instructions. And

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:25.325
because this difference in speed has been growing very quickly over many years,

00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:30.005
we have been using caches as a sort of stairs for the memory wall. So

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:33.862
our processors now are accessing caches, which are fast, and

00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:38.665
only those rare accesses that's missing the cache will end up going to the slow

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:43.500
main memory. We will spend several lessons talking about how to do caches and so

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.722
on, but this is just one of the trends that we have to worry about when we

00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:52.497
design processors, is that they do get faster. But if the memory doesn't get

00:01:52.497 --> 00:01:57.373
faster as quickly as they do, we have to continuously keep improving our caches

00:01:57.373 --> 00:02:02.210
just to allow the processors to not suffer from the much, much slower memory.
