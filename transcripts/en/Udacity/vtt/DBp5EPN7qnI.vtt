00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.340
Suppose that we are given one machine
M1 that recognizes a language L and

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.170
another machine M2 that
recognizes L's compliment.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.940
If we were to ask your average
programmer to use these machines to

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.340
decide the language, his first
guess might go something like this.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.290
Run M1 on x, and accept if it accepts.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.520
Otherwise, run M2 on x,
and reject if it accepts.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.050
One of these two has to
produce an accept after all.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.080
This program will not decided L,
however.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.880
And I want you to tell me why.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.970
So look at these, and
check the best answer.
