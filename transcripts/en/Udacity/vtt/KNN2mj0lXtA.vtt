00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.343
Now let's look at the next step in converting light to data.

00:00:04.343 --> 00:00:09.354
The actual sensor information, with Bayer data, will have something like this.

00:00:09.354 --> 00:00:11.708
We saw some of that in the previous slide.

00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:15.275
The red is chunked up into small reds here, because that's the red rows.

00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:17.620
The green, of course, also have this Bayer pattern.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.360
This is, again, output of a Bayer filter.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.914
We want to demosaic this to get our real image.

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:25.137
Going through the process that I talked about,

00:00:25.137 --> 00:00:28.260
with some interpolation, we can construct an image like this.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.850
Here you see a little bit of an aliasing, because again,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.830
we have intentionally showcased the kind of artifacts of doing this.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.900
But simple cleaning and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.740
interpolation that's done, this image would be made to look perfect.
