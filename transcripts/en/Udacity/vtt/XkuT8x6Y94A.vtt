00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you've used Reddit before, you know it's a big list of links

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and you can just vote on those links up and down.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The front page is whatever is the most popular.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
They can be voted up or voted down.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And good links stay at the top of the page for a long time,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and mediocre links may make an appearance but disappear after a short while.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So this is a really cool feature of Reddit,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and it's actually not that hard to compute.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What we do is we use a special index.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I'll show you how that works.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So we've got a table--a link table--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that looks something a lot like what we've been dealing with.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's got an id and it's got a number of up votes,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a number of down votes and a date.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And it also has this field called score.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's a floating-point field.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And this is the total score of the link.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So you may have 10 ups, 1 down,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the score might be actually 25.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And the way the Reddit hot algorithm works is

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
there's an index on the score field--it used to just be called the hot index--

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and it was really just on the score field.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
One approach to generating this front page might be to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
take all the links submitted in the last 24 hours,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
do some fancy math, sort them by how many up votes and down votes--

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the spread between these two votes is--

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and sort it that way.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But that doesn't really capture that hotness--

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
how things rise and fall.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So every time--like for example--you add 1 up vote,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we actually increment the score by some other amount.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And this other amount is computed through this hot function,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and that hot function looks something like this.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It's a hot function, and it takes the number of ups, the number of downs--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
so it can compute a total score, which is ups minus downs--

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and the submission date of the link--this field.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So what happens is, over time,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the value of an up vote increases.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So an up vote today might be worth 1 point,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and that same up vote tomorrow, on the same link,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
will be worth 10 points.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And what this causes is it causes our scores to, over time,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
be constantly increasing.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So newer links always have

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
higher scores than older links.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So a link

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that's one day old with lots of votes

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
has the same popularity as a link that's one minute old

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
with just a few votes, and that's what keeps our front page churning.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And it's really actually very simple,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and it's a very fast query we can do.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We can just say effectively something like this.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Select * from links order by score descending.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And then we get the hottest links on Reddit.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And this is a very simple and fast query,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
because all it does is really just bounce off the hot index.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And it's neat. You get this really cool effect for not a lot of cost.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now, to be fair, it took us a little while to figure this out,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and we actually--the first person who read it, took the approach of taking

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
all of the links from the last 24 hours and doing some math on them

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and sorting them in memory.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But later one of our guys came up with this notion of a hot score,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and we can just convert that into an index, then there we go.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
We've got a database that keeps our links always sorted

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
in order of hotness whenever we need them.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So I thought you might enjoy that.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Let's move along.
