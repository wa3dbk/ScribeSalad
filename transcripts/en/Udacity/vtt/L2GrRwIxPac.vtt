We're definitely getting there. We have everything related to y on the left side

00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:08.354
of the equation, since t is our y coordinate, and everything related to x as

00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:12.453
well as our slope on the right side. However, I see one thing that we can do to

00:00:12.453 --> 00:00:16.672
change this a little bit that I think will help us out. I provide a new form for

00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:21.230
you that I'd like us to write this equation. So see if you can figure out which

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.141
variable, that's on the right side right now, belongs in which box. Please note

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:30.461
that I only want one variable in each box. And of course, I want this equation

00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:32.448
to be equivalent to this equation.
