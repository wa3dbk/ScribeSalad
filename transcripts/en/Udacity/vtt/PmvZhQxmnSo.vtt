00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.242
We can find the slant asymptotes by using long division, and dividing the above

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:11.917
function. 3x squared plus 2 divided by x. When we divide that, we get 3x plus 2

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:17.700
over x. As x gets larger, the term becomes infinitely smaller, and we move

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.749
toward the line y equals 3x, which is our slant asymptote.
