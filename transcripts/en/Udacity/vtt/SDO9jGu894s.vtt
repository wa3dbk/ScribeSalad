00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.250
Okay, the answer should be 1. Here's how we figure that out. I know as I go from

00:00:05.262 --> 00:00:10.250
27 to 9, I divide by 3, and then to get to 9 to 3, I divide by another 3. So to

00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:15.200
find 3 to the zero, I need to take my number and divide it again by 3, 3 divided

00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:19.670
by 3 makes 1. That's how I know 3 to the zero is 1. It turns out that this is

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:24.123
true for any power of zero. Okay, I've re-drawn my pattern of 2. I know as the

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:28.995
exponent decreases, this number also decreases. To get from 8 to 4, I divided by

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:33.248
2. This should make sense because I know exponents represent repeated

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.137
multiplication. So to drop one exponent, I need to undo multiplication I need to

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.169
do Division.

00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:43.867
And then to get from 42, I divide by 2 again. So, I know to get from 2, 2 to the

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.361
0, I have to divide by 2 one more time. I have to drop my exponent one. I have

00:00:48.373 --> 00:00:51.610
to undo multiplication, so I do division, and I get one.
