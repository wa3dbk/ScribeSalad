00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And I would say the answer is this one, because these quadrants were equally spaced

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and these bars are of equal sizes.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Whereas these three seem to have slices that are significantly different in size,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which would imply significantly different cuts.
