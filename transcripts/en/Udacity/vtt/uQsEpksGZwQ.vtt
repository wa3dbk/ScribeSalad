00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is the 4th choice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We've already used the single = to mean something else.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Single = means assignment.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We can't use it to mean equality as well because that would be confusing.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There are places where we couldn't tell what the code meant if single = meant both

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
equality and assignment.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Here's an example.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The assignment i = 21 assigns the value of 21 to the variable i.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The expression i == 21 is a comparison.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It evaluates to either true or false depending on whether the value of i is 21.
