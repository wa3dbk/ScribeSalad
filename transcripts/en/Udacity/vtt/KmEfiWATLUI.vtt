00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.288
The correct answer is negative 2.5. Call the formula for the t statistic x bar

00:00:04.288 --> 00:00:09.135
minus mu, divided by the standard error of the mean. So we have 126 minus 151

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:15.716
divided by 10, gives us negative 25 divided by 10, equals negative 2.5.
