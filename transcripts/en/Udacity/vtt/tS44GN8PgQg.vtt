Okay, hopefully those NSKeyedArchiver
methods were pretty straightforward.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.560
Time to check in and see if your
app looks something like this.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.670
Here, I've created a few GIFS, then I
close the app, I shut it down so it's

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.050
not running in the background, and when
I relaunch it, my GIFS are still there.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.520
Fantastic.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.640
So, now we can check off
Persists saved GIFs.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.590
Next up, let's go back and
set up the detail view for

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.630
the GIFs in our collection.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.490
In order to do that, you'll need to
create the DetailViewController.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.860
Implement our old friend,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.240
didSelectItemAtIndexPath, to
present that detail view, and then,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.040
add the ability to share
a GIF from that detail view.
