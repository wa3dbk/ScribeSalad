00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And now for the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, of course, there is no real answer to that quiz.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Any answer is fine in here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
However, a few comments on the individual options.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes in solving puzzles and all,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
this unit is right for you--as is debugging, for that matter.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If you think that Sherlock Holmes is outdated,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
well, try and read one of the old stories and see how outdated they really are

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or check out one of the most recent adaptations of Sherlock Holmes.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If you find Sherlock Holmes annoying

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because his way of reasoning is obnoxious

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
or showing off his super-smartness,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that's probably correct, but I think that Arthur Conan Doyle

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
actually wanted to portray Sherlock Holmes as somebody who's not entirely likable.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Finally, Sherlock Who?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Here's something to discover for you. Enjoy.
