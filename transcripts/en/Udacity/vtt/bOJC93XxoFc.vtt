00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.890
To give a complete algorithm,
for coarsening a graph,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.360
you need a scheme to decide
which vertices to combine.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.770
One idea is to compute a matching.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.000
So what's that?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.110
Here's a formal definition, a matching
of a graph is a subset of edges,

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.280
such that,
no two edges have a common end point.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.830
It's, basically, an independent set,
but for edges, as opposed to vertices.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.030
For instance,
take these three highlighted edges.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.880
They form a matching because
they don't share any end points.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.450
That is, suppose you wanted to add this
edge to the matching, bad OMSCS student.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.650
You can't add this edge because it would
touch an existing edge of the matching.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.910
So that's a matching.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.020
What's a maximal matching?

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.090
A maximal matching is one to which
you can't add anymore edges.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.580
In fact, this matching is maximal.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.540
In fact, if you go through all
the remaining unmatched edges,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.670
you'll find that you can't add any
of them to the current matching.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.130
I want to contrast maximal to maximum.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.590
A maximum matching is the largest
matching, for example, this

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.020
graph has at least one more matching,
with more than three edges in it.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.600
Can you find it?

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.530
Here's one, though there might be more.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.760
Okay, back to maximal matchings.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.280
Maximal matchings are easier to compute,
so we'll focus on those.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.380
Indeed, this is a good time to check
that you understand the concept of

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.230
a maximal matching.
