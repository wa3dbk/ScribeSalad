00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.009
When you think of
assessments in education,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.460
you probably think of what we
call summative assessments.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.110
These are things like tests and quizzes
that occur at the end of some learning

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.320
process, to see whether or not you
learned the material by some deadline.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.120
And you take the assessment, you find
out if you passed or failed, and

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.130
you move forward either way.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.270
But wouldn't it be great to find out
while you're learning if you're learning

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.390
the material well enough?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.320
That's where formative
assessment comes in.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.515
Formative assessment is assessment while
you're learning some new material.

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:24.566
And it's really powerful,

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.710
because it more authentically mimics
the way we learn in the real world.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.050
When you're learning to walk or talk,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.900
what you're really doing is trying
lots of things every single minute and

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.420
getting immediate feedback on whether or
not you did it correctly.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.460
That's formative assessment.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.390
It's assessment while you're
trying to learn something.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.050
So formative assessment
is very powerful, and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.540
I would say it's
universally a good idea.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.920
The difficulty is it's very difficult
to do in a regular classroom.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.910
When you have one teacher and
20 or 30 students,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.440
how do you have that one
teacher give all those students

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.560
individual feedback on what they're
doing wrong all at the same time?

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.530
It just can't be done.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.676
And a college classroom
is even more difficult.

00:00:56.676 --> 00:00:59.221
You have one professor and
200 or 300 students.

00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:01.801
How can they give 200 students
feedback all at the same time?

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:03.500
It's just not possible.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.420
That's why we talk about this in
an educational technology class.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.720
Educational technology
can help us with that.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.880
Educational technology can develop tools
to give students individual feedback on

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.220
what they're doing
while they're doing it.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.070
We can use artificial intelligence
to give every single student

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.610
some individualized feedback on what
they did wrong on that latest iteration

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.650
all at the same time, even if everyone
is doing something different.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.460
So that's why we talk
about it in this class.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.840
So in this lesson, we'll talk about
what formative assessment is,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.070
why it's powerful, and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.710
how we can develop educational
technologies that help facilitate it.
