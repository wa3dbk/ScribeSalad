00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.412
Casting with instance of checks is something you will occasionally need to use

00:00:03.412 --> 00:00:07.852
when programming in Java, but it's best to avoid it in general. Let's explore

00:00:07.852 --> 00:00:11.908
why. Here's the code for seeing.Java that you wrote before. What if we had

00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:16.056
accidentally forgotten to do this check and I just gone through all of the

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:21.215
elements and tried to move them. What will happen if I run the program now?

00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:26.106
Feel free to try this yourself in BlueJ. Will the program run the same way?

00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:31.290
Will the houses move even though they should be stationary? Will there be a

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.882
compile time error because drawables can't be cast to type movable? Or will

00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:40.090
there be a run time error? Because some drawables cannot be cast to type

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.339
moveable. Like I said, if you're not sure feel free to try it out.
