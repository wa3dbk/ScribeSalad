00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.336
Now with our basic entity type defined, we can use it to create various

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:08.151
overloaded types of entities based upon our need later in the game. In order to

00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:11.632
spawn an instance of one of these entity types, we provide a spawn entity

00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:15.170
method, which takes a string, containing the desired class type name and

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.827
returns an instance of the appropriate entity object. I'd like you to fill out

00:00:20.827 --> 00:00:23.708
this spawn entity method to handle creation of these example entities given the

00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:25.430
appropriate strings.
