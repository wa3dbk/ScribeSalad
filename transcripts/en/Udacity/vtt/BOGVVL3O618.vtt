00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.140
let's discuss the solution to our latest Amdahl's law

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.240
quiz. We have three possible improvements and now we

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.210
can use Amdahl's law to tell us which one

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.119
of them is the best. For improving the branch

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.810
CPI this is our option 1: the overall speedup

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.777
is branches are happening 20% of the time, so,

00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:20.330
so this is actually the percentage of time so

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.676
we can apply Amdahl's law properly. So the unaffected execution

00:00:25.676 --> 00:00:32.070
time is 80% and the 20% we do affect, we speedup by how much?

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.242
By factor of 4 over 3, so this is 1.33. And we get

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:42.542
an overall speedup of 1.05. The clock

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.860
frequency increase from 2 to 2.3 gigahertz,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.758
is affecting all the execution time, so we can just compute the speedup of

00:00:50.758 --> 00:00:55.822
this, but for the sake of exercise, let's apply Amdahl's law. One minus

00:00:55.822 --> 00:01:01.036
fraction enhanced is 0, because everything is enhanced. The fraction

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:05.761
enhanced is 1, and the speedup we get here, by going

00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:10.801
from 2 to 2.3 gigahertz, is 2.3 over 2; which is

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:15.950
1.15 and the overall speedup we get is the 1.15.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.198
The third option is for stores, the unaffected fraction is at 0.9, the affected

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:29.242
fraction is 0.1. The speedup of going from 3 to 2 is 1.5, and when

00:01:29.242 --> 00:01:35.400
we compute that we get 1.034. So it's a very small speedup. Even smaller

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.143
than we got for branches. So overall

00:01:38.143 --> 00:01:41.762
improving the clock frequency gives us a significantly

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:44.688
higher improvement overall, than the other

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:48.059
two options. Primarily because this is a

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:54.517
smaller improvement in terms of speedup on the fraction affected. But the clock

00:01:54.517 --> 00:01:56.981
frequency increase affects all of the

00:01:56.981 --> 00:02:00.369
instructions, versus here, we affect only 20%

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.910
of the execution time and here we're affecting only 10% of the execution time.
