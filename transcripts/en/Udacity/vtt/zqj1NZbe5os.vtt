00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.660
Our z score is 1.89, which is less than a z score, 1.96. Therefore, our sample

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.522
mean will fall somewhere in this white region. One of the 95% of sample means

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:16.558
surrounding the population mean. Therefore, we fail to reject the Ho or the

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:21.620
null hypothesis. There's not enough evidence that the new population parameter,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.000
will be significantly different from what it is now. After we implement this

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.298
musical lesson. In other words, we would guess that engagement will stay the

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:33.573
same based on our sample.
