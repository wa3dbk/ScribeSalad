00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.820
What is LinkedIn and why does it matter?

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.440
LinkedIn is the world's largest
professional online network

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.070
with over 300 million users.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.550
Notably, it's quite different
than a traditional resume,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.270
whereas your resume highlights
your career at a glance.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.930
LinkedIn paints a vivid portrait of
you no matter what your background.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.460
LinkedIn has multiple functions, for

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.280
example, many recruiters increasingly
use LinkedIn to connect with candidates.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.590
Your profile can be a great way to
market your accomplishments online and

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.660
get noticed by employers and
apply to jobs.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.760
LinkedIn can also help to strengthen
your profession network and

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.870
learn about industry trends.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.450
Since many industry leaders are active
contributors to the LinkedIn community,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.690
LinkedIn often features
interesting articles,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.570
talks and
quotes from industry thought leaders.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.710
It can also be a great place to initiate
informational interviews, network, and

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.350
see what your peers
are up to professionally.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.580
A strong LinkedIn profile
is a powerful tool to have,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.420
is your profile doing
everything you needed to do?
