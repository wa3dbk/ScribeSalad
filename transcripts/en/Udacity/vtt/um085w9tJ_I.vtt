00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.620
So far, we have described how data store uses

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.890
indexes to execute queries. Now is the time to look

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.410
at some query restrictions that exist. As you know

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.400
by now, data store was designed to be massively scalable.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.420
Therefore the performance of queries should only depend on

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.870
the size of the result set, in other words the

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.090
amount of data returned in the query and not

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.450
on the overall amount of data stored in data storage.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.060
To meet this objective, data store always uses the

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.720
indexes to find the matching data. And this leads

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.970
to two restrictions you should be aware of when

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.880
you design your applications. The first one is an inequality

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.780
filter can be applied to at most one property

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.970
within the query. The following filter is not valid

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.600
because we are applying an inequality filter for two

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.450
different properties. The second rule is that a property with

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.830
an equality filter must be sorted first. The

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.530
following query is for example not valid. Since the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.300
property max attendees is used with an inequality filter,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.099
it must be the first property after Sort By,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.790
not name. The best way to avoid these

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.230
restrictions is to think and plan which queries you

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.600
need during the design phase. That way, you can

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.130
design around them. So now we'll do an exercise

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.180
where you will explore these query restrictions.
