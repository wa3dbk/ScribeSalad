00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.730
Now unfortunately, the basic form of the functional class pattern does result in

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.020
duplicated method, as we saw with the earlier form of the decorator pattern.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.570
The line adding .move as a property of Car creates a brand new

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.870
function every time we invoke the Car constructor function.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.720
Looking at the diagram again, you can see that every instance of

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.640
the Car class has its own unique version of the move method.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.720
We may prefer instead, to have it be the case that one function object is

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.379
shared across all Car objects to save memory.

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:31.266
To avoid having so

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:35.106
many duplicate versions of the move method, we'll need to move the code that

00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:38.848
defines the move method outside the body of the Car constructor function.

00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:41.934
In this way, the interpreter will only visit that code one time.

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:45.398
And therefore, only build one such function to be shared across all

00:00:45.398 --> 00:00:46.390
the instances.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.240
Rather than building a new one every time we invoke a Car.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.240
But notice, if we have moved the definition of the move method outside of

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.670
the body of the constructor, then this function should no

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.460
longer have closure scope access to the obj variable.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.120
The obj variable's where we'll be storing the instance of the car.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.740
So if this is off limits, the move method won't work at all.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.300
How can we write this function such that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.500
all the instances of Car could make use of it, even though it

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.070
won't have access to the closure scope that those instances were created in
