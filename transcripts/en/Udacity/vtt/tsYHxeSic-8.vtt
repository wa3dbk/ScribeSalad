&gt;&gt; That's a very good answer, David. First of all, your answer is correct.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.650
And in addition, you were able to point out that there is no slot here which is

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.440
able to take care of the information coming in as input about her dad.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.240
Before we worry about what information that Angela had lasagna with her dad.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.030
Let us look at some of the properties of frames. So once again there are slots.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.099
You can put fillers in the slots. Each filler may come from a range of values.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:09.530
Some of these slots have default fillers. Now you can see how some kind of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.310
common sense inferences become possible. Some of them become possible from these

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.930
default fillers for these slots. So for example, when we said Ashok ate a frog,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.220
and David answered the question whether the frog was dead or alive by saying

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.050
the frog was dead. Well, we know about it because there is a default value here,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.650
the object that has been eaten is not alive, it's false to say it's alive.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.060
And the location of the object after it has been eaten is inside the subject's

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.150
stomach, or inside the subject's body. And so on. We could put here more slots,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.720
with more default values for them. Once again, we'll discuss a lot more about

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.020
common sense reasoning a little bit later in this particular course. For now,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.440
we are trying to understand the knowledge and presentation of frames.
