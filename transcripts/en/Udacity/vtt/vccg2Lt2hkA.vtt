00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.412
We ended the last quiz with this equation, but if we add k to both sides, we

00:00:05.412 --> 00:00:10.992
could end up with this equation, u equals x squared minus 2hx plus h squared

00:00:10.992 --> 00:00:16.370
plus k. So here, y is by itself on one side, and then all of the x terms and

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.477
constants are on the right side. We've seen a number of equations for parabolas

00:00:21.477 --> 00:00:25.637
that are in this form, even if we didn't see general forms of them written with

00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:30.211
constants like these. So let's compare this to another parabola. Maybe y equals

00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:34.891
x squared, plus 6x plus 5, now because these two equations are in the same form,

00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:39.355
we should be able to figure out the value of each of the constants over here,

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:44.304
based on the value of constants over here. So compared to this general equation,

00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:48.692
in equation y equals x squared plus 6 x plus 5, what number is h equal to? So

00:00:48.692 --> 00:00:53.172
find where the constant h appears in this general equation, figure out where

00:00:53.172 --> 00:00:57.792
that corresponds to in our equation with particular values inserted, and then

00:00:57.792 --> 00:01:02.312
calculate age based on that. This is a little bit tricky, but just give it a few

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:02.755
tries.
