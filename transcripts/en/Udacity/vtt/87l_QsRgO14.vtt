00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.678
Let's try another equation. This time, the bases are fraction. Now, don't be

00:00:04.678 --> 00:00:09.580
worried, it works the same way as before. We want to think about rewriting the

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.424
right-hand side of the equation, so that way we have the same base of 3 5ths,

00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:18.960
as we do on the left. Once we have identical bases, of 3 5ths, we can set these

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.466
two exponents equal to one another. So, try your best and see if you can find

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.300
x.
