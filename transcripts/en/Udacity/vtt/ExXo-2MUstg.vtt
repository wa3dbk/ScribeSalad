00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.021
Negative 10 3rds is correct.We start by multiplying each set of our equation by

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:11.380
5 plus y, the common denominator. Another way to think about it would be cross

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:18.072
multiplying 1 times 5 is 5 and at 3 times 5 plus y is 15 plus 3y. We subtract 15

00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:23.372
from both sides and then divide by 3 to get y is equal to negative 10 thirds.
