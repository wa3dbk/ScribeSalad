00:00:00.156 --> 00:00:03.645
Here’s another quiz. You’re dropping a package

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:06.931
out of an aircraft, and the package goes down

00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:10.329
and we happen to know it takes between 3 and

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:13.808
3.5 minutes to reach the ground. And, let’s say,

00:00:13.808 --> 00:00:16.575
in between the probability density is uniform.

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:19.527
Asking the same question again. There’s something

00:00:19.527 --> 00:00:24.708
to be learnt here. Here is 3. Here is 3.5. Obviously,

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:28.592
the density outside is zero, is uniform, and there’s

00:00:28.592 --> 00:00:32.592
a value here A. And, I want you to tell me what is A.
