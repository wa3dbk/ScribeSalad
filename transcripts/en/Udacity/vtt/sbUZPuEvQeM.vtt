00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.190
There's another very worthwhile
optimization we can do to our

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.070
JavaScript, and it's quite similar
to how we use Sass instead of CSS.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.522
Turns out there is a way of running
the very latest spec of JavaScript,

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:14.800
ECMASript 6, even though there's
no native browser support for

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.600
many of the features.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.070
All we need is a transpiler, which
takes one programming language, and

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.200
converts it into another.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.490
Sometimes transpilers stay very
close to ECMAScript syntax,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.890
adding in a few features here and there.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.940
In other cases, they are full
implementations of languages you

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.470
don't typically find in purely
front end web development.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.880
We'll stick to the former category.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.630
Our transpiler of choice is Babel JS.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.670
It's very popular, feature rich and
well supported by the community.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.790
Now of course this step
is purely optional.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.870
If you're happy with today's JavaScript
and don't need all the fanciness, great.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.440
But if you're curious to try out
arrow functions, generators and

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.520
classes, now is the perfect time.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.690
And sure enough, getting this into our
code is as simple as everything else.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.070
Just grab the gulp-babel plugin and
require it in your gulp file.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.760
And in both script task,
pipe it after the gulp.src, but

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.860
before the concatenation.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.560
You won't see any difference right away,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.090
as you're not actually using any
ES6 magic in your current code.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.150
So head over to Babel's ES6
learning page and

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.840
get familiar with some of the concepts.
