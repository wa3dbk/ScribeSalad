00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.010
I want to think about what number multiplied by 3x is 12x squared. That must be

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:12.144
4x. Again, to get that, we simply divide the first term 12 squared, by the first

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:18.104
term of our divisor, 3x. 12x squared divided by 3x is positive 4x. 4x times 3x

00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:23.207
is 12x squared. And 4x times negative 2 is negative 8x. Now we're ready to

00:00:23.207 --> 00:00:28.547
subtract this expression, which means we change both of these signs. The first

00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:33.569
term is negative and the second term becomes positive. 12x square minus 12

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:38.731
square equals 0, and 1x plus 8x equals 9x. Fantasic work if you got all four of

00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:39.645
those boxes.
