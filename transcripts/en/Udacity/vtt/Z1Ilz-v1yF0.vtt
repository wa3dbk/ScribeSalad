Just like activity content transitions,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.280
shared element transitions use
the same plumbing to power them.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.450
That is the transitions framework.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.913
Let's go back to our photo grid example,
and add a shared element transition, so

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:16.539
that the selected photo transitions
smoothly between the grid and

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.540
the details page.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.320
Here's what it's going to look like.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.870
Hopefully you agree that this is a much
smoother, more continuous experience.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.610
Now to build this, it helps to
understand a little bit about how

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.960
the system works under the hood.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.020
When we say we're doing a shared element
transition between two activities,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.650
we aren't actually sharing
any views in their hierarchy.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.270
Each activity has
an independent view tree.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.010
What we're doing, is passing
information about the shared view.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.230
Such as, its position and
its size between the two.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.420
When the second activity launches,
it sets a transparent background and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.240
hides all of its own view so
that you can, so to speak,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.190
see through to the previous
activity behind it.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.560
It then locates the shared view
within its own hierarchy and

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.000
alters its attributes to match those
passed in from the launching activity

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.710
and makes that single view visible.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.840
It then runs animations to transition
the shared view from this state

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.270
to its natural position in the layout.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.030
As the transition progresses,
the window background and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.730
the rest of the non-shared amids slowly
fade in until they're totally opaque.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.180
So, while the views aren't technically
shared, it's clever trick of smoke and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.250
mirrors as it were,
makes it appear that they are.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.810
So now that we understand
how the process works,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.300
let's take a look at how we mark
elements as being shared, and

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.221
how we control
the animations that are run.
