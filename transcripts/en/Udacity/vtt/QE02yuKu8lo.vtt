00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.408
Answer choice e is correct here. Great job if you're figuring out the meaning of

00:00:04.408 --> 00:00:08.747
negative exponents. We know negative exponents would give us the reciprocal of

00:00:08.747 --> 00:00:12.962
the base, and then we change each negative exponent to it's positive form. In

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:17.102
the end, I'll have 7 times 4 times 1, which is just 7, over x squared times y

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:22.451
cubed. And again, our negative exponents move the bases to the denominator with

00:00:22.451 --> 00:00:23.945
positive exponents.
