00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.410
So the simple barrier operation doesn't work entirely.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.320
And we look now at why it doesn't work.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.670
Let's consider only two cores. Core 0, which we

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.750
will show in blue color what it's doing. And

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.900
core 1, which we will show in this

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.230
color what it's doing. What they're both doing initially

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.390
is doing something before they arrive to the barrier.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.050
And let's say that Core 0 arrives here first.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.619
So what Core 0 does, is resets release to 0, increments the count to 1, unlocks

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.290
the lock, checks whether the count is equal

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.100
to 2, and starts spinning, waiting for the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.392
release to become 1. So now, release is still 0 because we just reset it. And

00:00:44.392 --> 00:00:51.390
core 0 is going to to stay here spinning. So, what core 0 does is it essentially

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.580
does a load word of release, sees 0, and will check again. And it keeps

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.535
doing that. Now, let's see what happens

00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:04.269
when core 1 arrives. Normally, what should happen

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.580
is, core 1 arrives, doesn't do this

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.390
because count is now 1. Increments the count,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.610
exits the critical section. Sees that the count is equal to 2, resets the count,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.790
sets the release to 1, and now core

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.920
1 proceeds past the barrier. What should happen

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.810
now is core 0 should see this release that we just set to 1. And also proceed

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.251
past the barrier. So, what should happen is really that we set the release to 1

00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:38.650
here and core 0 sees that. Exits the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.730
barrier and from then, everything will actually be correct.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.166
But let's say that core 0 has been

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:48.702
checking the release, however, when the store happens, core

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:52.066
0 is delayed. For example, it's executing some sort

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.434
of an interrupt function so for a while it's

00:01:54.434 --> 00:01:56.866
suspended in this place in the code and cannot

00:01:56.866 --> 00:02:00.180
read the release fast enough. In that case, we

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.310
don't have this, and core 0 is still stuck

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.775
here. In a correct barrier implementation, core 0 will

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:11.260
eventually, at some point, it will return from the interrupt, read the release

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.158
that is 1, and proceed. However, what happens if core 0

00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:21.246
is waiting here while core 1, after releasing and exiting the

00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:26.526
barrier, does very little work and then comes back to the barrier

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:31.820
again? It sees that the count is 0, because it reset

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.270
it to 0 when it was releasing the barrier.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.038
And sets the release to 1. And now it writes

00:02:37.038 --> 00:02:39.918
0 to the release variable and now, even if core

00:02:39.918 --> 00:02:42.726
0 checks the release here and sees what it is,

00:02:42.726 --> 00:02:45.740
it's going to see the 0. So, core 0 is

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.800
going to proceed to wait here for a very long

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.322
time. Meanwhile, core 1 increments the count to 1. Checks

00:02:54.322 --> 00:02:56.935
if it's equal to 2 for the second iteration of

00:02:56.935 --> 00:02:59.960
the barrier. It's not 2, so core 1 is

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.445
now going to spin waiting for somebody to release

00:03:03.445 --> 00:03:06.845
the second instance of the barrier while core 0

00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:09.820
is going to be waiting there, in the first

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.454
instance of the barrier, and never being released. So

00:03:14.454 --> 00:03:16.562
the only thing that can really core 1 now

00:03:16.562 --> 00:03:18.670
is if core 0 somehow left and entered the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.072
second instance of the barrier. The only thing that

00:03:22.072 --> 00:03:26.360
can release core 0, however, is if somebody comes and releases here, but

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.030
that's not going to be core 2. So, now we have a deadlock situation.
