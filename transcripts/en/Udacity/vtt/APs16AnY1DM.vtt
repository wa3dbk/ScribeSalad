So, I know this seems like a lot of information, and it is. But that's why you

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:08.300
have this PDF. Come back to it whenever you need to, it should really help.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.740
Now, the last section of this lesson that we're going to go over is how you can

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.650
measure brain activity. I'm going to pass it to Susan to explain it to you.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.657
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Many of the advances in understanding a link between behavior and brain have

00:00:19.657 --> 00:00:23.037
occurred in the last 20 years because of better techniques of measuring brain

00:00:23.037 --> 00:00:28.348
activity. For example, how do we know that spatial ability is related to the

00:00:28.348 --> 00:00:33.748
parietal area? Or that the frontal lobe is responsible for impulse control? How

00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:38.380
do we know the hippocampus is associated with learning and memory?

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.268
Historically, we learned about the brain function through accidents. Such as we

00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:46.258
saw with Phineas Gage. Since the 1940s we have been able to measure brain

00:00:46.258 --> 00:00:50.387
activity. But it's really been since the 1990s that we've seen better

00:00:50.387 --> 00:00:53.726
techniques that allow us to look at precise areas of the brain that are being

00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:59.157
activated. This has been such a revolution that some people call it the

00:00:59.157 --> 00:01:01.110
neuroscience revolution.
