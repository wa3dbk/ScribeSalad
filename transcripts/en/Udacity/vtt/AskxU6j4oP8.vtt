00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.170
Let's take a look at the code.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.450
Now the first thing we do is we set a variable called rules affable to be true.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.820
And this is so that we know when we can continue applying to the given rules

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.870
and that way we know when we can simply be done with the function.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.410
We also get a temporary assignment to all of the variables of none

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.610
since we haven't assigned that neither true or false values yet.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.490
Now in this loop, well, we can still apply rules.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.380
We first set rules affable to false and let's say that unless we come into a situation

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.340
where we might be able to apply the rules again,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.240
we just assume that this is the last time we'll be able to do this.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.730
We first deal with single occurrence variables,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.190
so we set a counter to be zero for each of the variables here

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.550
and we'll also set the variable setting to none for each of the variables.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.000
And then, for each of the clauses and each variable in each clause,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.300
we set the absolute value of the variable and then we increment variable counter of that variable

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.160
by 1 since we've seen that variable now and we set this variable to 1

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.110
if it does greater than 0 or 0, otherwise.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.280
Or we set it to 1 is 0 to represent true or false if it is positive or negative.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.480
Now, we enumerate all of the variable counters with i and var,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.340
and if var is not equal to 1 then we go ahead and just continue.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.120
And if our temporary assignment is not none, that is it's already going to assign to something,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.200
we also continue, otherwise, we fall through

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.950
and we set the contemporary assignment to the current setting available.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.250
In here, we try to deal with single variable clauses.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.390
Now, for each clause in the list of clauses, we first check that the length of the clause is not zero.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.240
If the length of the clause is greater than 1, we go ahead and just continue to do it.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.280
We don't need to check any further; otherwise, we set the variable

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.610
equal to the only element in the list in the clause

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.320
and we set a var to the absolute value of that variable.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.380
Now if the temporary assignment of avar is not none,

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.390
if it's already assigned something, then if the temporary assignment of avar is not equal to 1,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.550
if the variable is greater than 0 else 0, then we return 1, -1

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.930
and this is because that means that the variable cannot be satisfied.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.600
This clause and that cannot be satisfied, and if not, then we go ahead and fall through

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.990
and we set the temporary assignment of this variable to 1

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.430
if the variable is greater than 0 and else 0.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.040
Now, we need to go ahead and clean up all of these clauses.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.290
In order to do this, we are going to accumulate all of the current clauses into a new list of clauses,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.570
so that we can remove the ones that we don't need to worry about anymore.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.450
And we enumerate all the current clauses and we also enumerate all the variables in each clause

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.520
and we set the assignment equal to the temporary assignment for each of these variables.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.660
If the assignment is none, then we go ahead and append that variable to the new clause

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.510
because it's still haven't determined what it should be, otherwise,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.710
we said that, well, we might be able to continue applying rules here

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.190
because we're about to remove some clauses.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.360
Now, if the current variable is assigned true, 1 and the variable is greater than 0

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.080
or the assignment is false, 0 and the variable is less than 0,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.160
that is it's negated then we can go ahead and remove the entire clause.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.740
So we set this new clause equal to none and we continue on.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.790
Otherwise, well, then we just have to remove the variable and we pass through.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.290
Now, if clause could not be satisfied then if the new clause is the empty set

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.780
then we go ahead and return 1, -1 to indicate they cannot be satisfied.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.950
Now if the clause instead is greater than 0 then we go ahead

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.870
and append this clause to the new list of clauses and at the end of this double for loop,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.520
we set the current list of clauses to the new list of clauses and if we have set rules applicable to true,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.530
then we go ahead and loop that through until that is not true.

00:04:07.530 --> 99:59:59.000
At the end of all this, we go ahead and return the list of clauses and that's it.
