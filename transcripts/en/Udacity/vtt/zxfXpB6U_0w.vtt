00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.630
So we seen a few examples measuring the time of execution of

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.320
toy programs, of a loop that does nothing. What we care about though

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.440
is the time of execution of our indexing code, so what I'm

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.610
going to do next is write a program to be able to test the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.580
time of execution of indexing code. To get a good test we

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.650
need to make a big index, we need to fill up an index

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.440
with lots and lots of words, and we can do that by hand;

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.430
that would take a lot of time and effort. So what I'm going to

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.054
do instead, is to find a procedure that makes a

00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:31.430
big index. So what it does is take in, a size,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.370
and then it's going to, fill up an index with that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.060
number of words. To fill up the index with that number

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.540
of keywords, we need to generate different words. So what

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.828
I've done is created a variable called letters, that is initially

00:00:42.828 --> 00:00:46.960
is all A's. And as we go through the loop, we

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.450
go through the loop size number of times. We keep making

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.613
a new string. We add that string to the next, I'll

00:00:51.613 --> 00:00:53.055
explain what make_string does later. We add that string to the

00:00:53.055 --> 00:00:59.730
index, then we change the letters. And we're

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.519
going to keep increasing the letter once we get to z, we wrap around. For now

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.530
it's not too important to understand everything in this code, but

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.110
I do want to walk through the code a little bit.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.550
So what this loop is doing is going through all the

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.825
positions and the letters are A and we filled this up with

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:19.420
eight different elements and we're going to go through those elements starting

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.130
from the last one going backwards, so this range loop goes from

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.840
the length minus 1 to 0, stepping by negative 1. We

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.750
are going to check each letter. If the letter is less than z,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.790
that means we can increase and we are going to increase it

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.410
using this code here and I'll talk soon about the code that

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.160
turns letters into numbers, but what this expression does is get

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.340
the next letter. So if the letter was an a the result

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.530
after this will be a b, and we're going to replace the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.260
letter at that position in the letters list, with the next

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.670
letter. If the letter is a z, we don't want to go

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.350
beyond the alphabet, so instead, we're going to set that letter to

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.350
a, and we're going to go back through the loop to find

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.830
the next letter. Once we found one less than z, we

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.110
break, we only need to change one letter. What the make_string

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.000
procedure does, that we call here. Is just turn that array into

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.880
one string. So it's going through the elements of P which

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.360
is this list of letters that keeps changing. And concatenating all those

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.320
letters into one string. So the whole point of this is to

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.390
allow us to easily make big indexes so we can run tests

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.450
on different size indexes. So let's try this in the Python shell.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.750
First I'll show you what the result is when we use make

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.875
big index. We'll start with a fairly small one, so I'm passing

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:32.100
three is the size. What make big index gives us is an

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.980
index with three keywords: aaaaaaaa, aaaaaaab, aaaaaaac and for

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.300
each of them there's one url which is the name

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.720
fake. If we're passing in a bigger value, this

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.950
will have an index with a hundred keywords, so we're

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.940
going to passing a hundred is the size, we get

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.910
this big index, and you can see it's starting to

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.430
change the second from the last letter. To make sure

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.910
that each word is a different word than the next.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.730
So, what we want to do now is look at

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.760
how the time of executions take for different size indexes. So,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.520
let's make a really big index. So what we're going to do,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.540
we'll make an index of size 10,000. And remember, our concern

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.080
is the time for lookups. It's the operation that's going to happen

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.090
most frequently. So we're not timing the time to make the

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.590
big index. Let's see what the time is to do a

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.970
lookup, and so I'll time the execution of looking up in

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.530
index 10,000 the keyword, and the word makes

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.860
a difference. So, first let's try looking up

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.550
the word udacity. Which, sadly, is not in

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.260
our index. We'd need a much bigger index

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.218
to get up to udacity. And the time of execution is shown here. So, it's 0.0008

00:03:42.218 --> 00:03:44.880
seconds. So, still getting close to a millisecond,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.950
but still quite fast. Let's make a bigger index.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.770
This time we have a 100,000 keywords. going to take

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.660
a little longer to make it, but we're not

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.932
worrying about the time to make it now. What

00:03:54.932 --> 00:03:56.560
we care is the time to do a look up.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.020
So that took a long time. Let's see how, many entries there are, so we can look

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.990
at the very last element in our index. And we can see got to aaaafryd,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.170
which I don't know to pronounce. Another way to see that, which

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.140
we didn't talk about yet, we can actually index from the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.579
back using negative numbers, so if you use negative 1 as

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.190
the index, that will give us the last entry in the

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.360
list. So, now we'll try doing a timed execution. We're going to

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.920
look up in the 10,000 size index. And we'll

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.680
see the time's pretty similar to what it was before,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.300
that time might vary a little bit, let's try

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.390
it once more, and again, it's just under a millisecond.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.212
So now, we'll try, instead of the 10,000 index,

00:04:38.212 --> 00:04:42.736
looking up in the 100,000 length index, the same look-up,

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:44.920
and we see that the time is now 10

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.366
times that, so it's now about 8.6 milliseconds whereas before

00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:55.330
it was 0.9 milliseconds. And let's, for consistency, try that again.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.480
We'll note that these timings vary a little bit, each time

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.020
we do it. And there's lots of reasons why the timing

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.490
varies. We're running lots of other things on the computer at the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.970
same time. So it's not the case that we have total

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.590
control over the processor and are running exactly the same thing every

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.800
time. Because all of the other programs might be doing other

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.370
things. The other reason the time can vary is where things are

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.600
in memory. Sometime it's very quick to look up a

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.690
value in memory, sometimes it takes longer. And we're not going to

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.530
talk about the details of that. What matters is that, that

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.820
the time's roughly the same, each time we execute it. And

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.760
it really depends on the size of the input, in this

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.240
case it's the size of the input table. So when we

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.106
increase the size of the table to have 100,000 entires, it's

00:05:36.106 --> 00:05:39.840
about 10 times as slow as when we had 10,000 entries.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.450
So now let's have a few quizzes to see if you can guess how these timings work.
