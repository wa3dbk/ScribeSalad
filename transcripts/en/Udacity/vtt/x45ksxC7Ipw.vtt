00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.659
Operating a CDN presents many different challenges. And

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.676
the underlying goal is to replicate content on

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:11.280
many servers. So that the content is replicated

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.990
close to the clients. Yet this leaves many open

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.210
questions. Including how to replicate the content. Where

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.500
it should be replicated, how clients should find

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.710
the replicated content, how to choose the appropriate

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.940
server replica, or cache, for a particular client, and

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.850
how to direct clients towards the appropriate replica once it's

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.220
selected. This problem is commonly known as server selection, and this

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.120
problem is sometimes called content routing. Let's take a look

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.370
at each of these problems in a little bit more detail.
