00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.740
So Pete,
what kind of design principles or

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.020
design thinking goes into
the product of Optimizely?

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.830
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.160
So two things come to mind that I think
has served us well from the beginning.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.540
When we started Optimizely,
to see our competitor's products,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.160
you had to go through a multi-step sale
cycle, which was really frustrating.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.070
And so, we had no name.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.410
We had no reputation,
we had no sales people either.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.265
And so we built our product in such
a way that anybody could go to

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:30.180
Optimizely.com and enter their website,
and immediately get the feeling for

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.430
what it was like to use our product.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.090
And I like think of that as putting
our product where our mouth is.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.650
You know?

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.150
And that forced us to design something
that was easy enough to use that

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.210
anybody could get it.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.260
Because the product was
the sales person, initially.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.450
And the second one I think that really,
really served us well was this idea of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.550
enabling the novice, but
empowering the expert.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.510
And that comes through.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.460
When you look at our product,
we built a visual editor.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.090
So, whether you're
looking at a website or

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.290
a mobile application,
you can use your mouse.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.360
You can drag things around.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.459
You can change text.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.980
You can do a lot of simple
things without having to

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.600
understand code at all.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.110
But we're engineers,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.250
and we were never really all that
trustful of wizzy wig editors like that.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.210
We don't typically use
Microsoft Word for that reason.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.700
And so, to satisfy our own itch there,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.140
we also made it possible for anybody
to go under the hood and see exactly

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.105
the code that we were generating as
a result of all this visual stuff.

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:32.830
And that made it possible for
a marketer to go in and use it, but

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.670
also their web developer to go in and
see exactly what was going on.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.640
We found that that's one of our
most consistently used features,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.330
to our surprise.
