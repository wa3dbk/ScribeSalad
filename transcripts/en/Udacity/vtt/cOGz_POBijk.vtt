00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.420
Okay, so we have been asked when will this instruction commit. We already know

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.960
that this one will broadcast the result in cycle 16, that means it cannot

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.062
commit in the next cycle. So, basically in cycle 15 we have committed this,

00:00:14.062 --> 00:00:17.950
in cycle 16 we cannot commit this because the broadcast is happening in 16,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.460
we can only commit it at 17. Next cycle 18, we will check if this can commit.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.050
Yes it can because it has already broadcasted its result and it's done.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.040
And finally this becomes 19. So the correct answer here is 19.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.938
You can see that, to determine this we didn't actually have to figure out what

00:00:34.938 --> 00:00:40.360
really happens here. But let's do that for the sake of exercise. So in cycle 17,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.070
this gets marked down. 32 gets deposited in register 1. We check the mapping for

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.670
R1. Is it ROB4, no. We leave the RAT alone, and free this ROB entry.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.480
In cycle 18, we can commit this. We put minus 1 in R4. We check the entry for

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.282
R4. Is it pointing to ROB5? It is. We changed the RAT to point to this R4 and

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:06.228
we free the ROB entry. And finally in cycle 19, we commit this instruction,

00:01:06.228 --> 00:01:10.192
we put the value of R3 into R1, we then check the ROB entry for

00:01:10.192 --> 00:01:14.516
R1, is it pointing to ROB6? Yes it is. Make it point to here, and

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:19.017
we can free this ROB entry. And this concludes really what happens,

00:01:19.017 --> 00:01:24.890
in this whole program as far as, you know, cycles one through 19 are concerned.
