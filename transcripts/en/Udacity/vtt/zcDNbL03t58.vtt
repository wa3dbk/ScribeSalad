00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.880
Now the coding solution is fantastic for a single file, but practical usage

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.023
fails. Once we want to load a suite of files, we effectively need to specify a

00:00:08.023 --> 00:00:12.592
callback for each one of them. Instead, we should add support to our asset

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:16.875
manager to allow us to pass a list of files to load. And receive one callback

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:20.705
once they've all been loaded. So what we'd like you to do, is modify the load

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:25.550
assets function to taking a list of asset names in a single callback function.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.232
Now just as a heads up, this process may be a little bit tricky. You'll

00:00:29.232 --> 00:00:31.920
probably want to do something right here in the onload function to keep track

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.104
of how many files have been loaded so far. Make note of it, so that you only

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:40.715
have to issue one callback function. One other interesting aspect that you're

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.724
going to have to change is what if all of the assets are loaded, or what if

00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:48.790
some sub-portion of them are loaded and other ones need to be loaded? In this

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.014
situation make sure you also take into account, what happens if half of the

00:00:52.014 --> 00:00:55.238
images are loaded, or none of the images are loaded, or all of the images are

00:00:55.238 --> 00:01:00.318
loaded? In these three different scenarios you should have a different logic

00:01:00.318 --> 00:01:04.634
path on when the callback function actually gets issued. So for example if all

00:01:04.634 --> 00:01:07.070
of the assets are loaded, you may only need to do one callback function

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.432
immediately.
