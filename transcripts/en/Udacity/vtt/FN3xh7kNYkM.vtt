00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.000
The first scenario is the typical case in which it is

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.040
recommended to use the extract method refactoring, when there is duplicated code

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.190
in two or more methods and we want to take this

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.420
code and factor is out, and basically have the two methods called

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.960
a third method, which is the one we create using the

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.060
refactoring. When a class is too large, normally we don't want to

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.330
apply the extract. Extract method. Instead, in this cases, it is

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.900
usually more appropriate to use the

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.420
extract class or extract subclass refactorings.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.750
Analogously, when the names of two classes are too similar, extracting a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.729
method will normally not help much. And all we need to do

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.810
in case having too similar names is actually a problem. Is to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.600
rename one of the two classes, or both, if we wish. Finally,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.530
it is definitely appropriate to apply the extract method of refactoring in

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.900
cases in which a method is highly coupled with a class other

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.330
than the one where it is defined. In this case, which we

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.740
will discuss also later in the lesson, the extract method of refactoring

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.710
allows us to extract part of the metal to With the other class.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.690
Then we can take the matter that we just extracted and move it

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.880
to the class where it actually belongs. So the extract method is one

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.560
of the two refactorings that it is appropriate to apply in these cases.
