00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.593
Here's the simplified expression. Great work if you got it correct. We can

00:00:04.593 --> 00:00:08.993
divide 10 and 15 by 5, so I get 2 3rds in the front. Then I notice that I'll

00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:13.339
have 3 more g's in my numerator than in my denominator. So g cubed in the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.919
numerator. Finally, I'll have 3 more h's in my denominator than I would in my

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.746
numerator. So I'll have an h cubed, or h to the 3rd, down below. But remember I

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:27.369
said there's always more than one way to think about this. We can simplify our

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.078
fraction in the front, just like from before, so we'll have 2 3rds. Then we'll

00:00:32.078 --> 00:00:36.503
have g to the 7 minus 4 here, we follow that with h to the 5 minus 8, 7 minus 4

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:41.114
makes 3, and 5 minus 8 is negative 3. G to the 3rd, has a positive exponent, so

00:00:41.114 --> 00:00:45.633
we make sure we list it in the numerator. H to the negative 3 has a negative

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:50.232
exponent, so we know that moves to the denominator, and we change the sign to

00:00:50.232 --> 00:00:55.139
make it positive. Think about the two ways to do this problem, and choose the

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:56.724
best that works for you.
