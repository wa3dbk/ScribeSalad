00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.810
This mockup is pretty similar to the portfolio mockup you worked on

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.730
in the previous lesson.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.570
There are some differences, however.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.780
For example, the layout of the work examples and

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.110
the color scheme, particularly that of the background.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.020
You can see the colors and the hex codes on the left hand side of the screen.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.890
But you should always start with looking at the design, and,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.030
as always, consider the structure.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.310
It should be pretty similar for

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.470
this mockup because it's so similar to the one you already did.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.530
Despite the fact that you don't know anything about Bootstrap yet,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.720
you can get started with a new webpage.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.120
Now that you've got the design mockup, which steps can you complete now?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.890
Can you create a folder structure for the project?

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.280
Can you create a DOM tree for the page?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.340
Can you write HTML that defines the DOM?

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.150
Can you assign class names to HTML elements?

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.670
Can you write CSS?

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.580
And can you the test the page?

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.330
Check all that apply.
