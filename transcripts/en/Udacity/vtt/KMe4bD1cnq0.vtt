00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.300
Another example of prefetching would
be the so-called Hardware Prefetching.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.270
Where the program doesn't change,
and the hardware itself, either

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.210
the processor or the cache is trying
to guess what will be accessed soon.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.980
There are a number of harder
prefetchers that work reasonably well.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.940
For example,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.610
many current processors include what's
called a Stream Buffer prefetcher.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.760
Other popular types of prefetchers
include a Stride Prefetcher and

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.270
what is called a Correlating Prefetcher.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.670
All of these try to guess what
is going to be accessed next

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.180
based on some sort of locality property.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.890
So a Stream Buffer is
sequential in nature.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.140
It's trying to see whether
once we access a blog and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.790
then the next block that follows it.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.858
We are likely to access
the next next block and so on.

00:00:48.858 --> 00:00:52.050
So it's just trying to fetch
several blocks in advance

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.015
in order to not be too late.

00:00:54.015 --> 00:00:58.700
A stride based prefetcher is
monitoring accesses to see if memory

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.940
accesses we are doing, are at
the fixed distance from each other.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.150
So if their addresses
differ by the same amount.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.760
It's going to guess,
that we will just continue doing that.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.880
And it starts prefetching with
the distance of D times something.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.830
And it determines how
many of these in advance.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.380
Such that it's just in time.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.570
A Correlating Prefetcher is
trying to predict sequences

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.120
of accesses that are not sequential or
at the same distance from each other.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.350
The way it does this is when
we see A and B accessed,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.470
it remembers in some sort of a table
that, when A comes then B comes.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.890
Then when C comes it remembers
that after B comes C and so on.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.510
And then later on if we see A,
it's going to look here and

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.700
issue prefetch for B.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.180
If we do access B it's going to
look here and issue a prefetch for

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.110
C and so on.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.400
So it can prefetch an arbitrary
sequence of accesses

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.305
as long as that sequence repeats.

00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:05.670
So it's very good for example for

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.210
linklist which are not necessarily
sequential in memory and

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.300
are not at fixed strides, but
if you access the first note, then

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.660
the second or third note and you do it
again, it's going to prefetch correctly.
