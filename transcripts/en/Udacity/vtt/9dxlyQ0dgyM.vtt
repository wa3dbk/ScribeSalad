Let's think a little bit more about one of our solutions, 3 plus 4i, the one we

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.301
were working with in the last problem. Now this is an interesting number,

00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:12.195
because it has one part of it that looks real and one part of it that looks

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:16.415
imaginary. So my question for you is where on our world of numbers diagram it

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:20.445
belongs. Please select the spot where you think it should be positioned.
