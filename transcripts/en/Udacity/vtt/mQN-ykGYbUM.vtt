00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.490
As they're talking,
Marla notices that Dr.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.310
Johnson is recording what they say on
a new tablet computer and asks about it.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.430
He explains that he recently
installed an electronic medical

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.330
records system as part
of a federal program.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.610
He goes on to explain that he'll be able
to use it to send an electronic record

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.800
of her care to Dr.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.300
Jones, so she will have it well
before Marla's scheduled visit.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.930
Marla is impressed.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.910
She doesn't want to remind Dr. Johnson,
but she remembers that when she first

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.410
visited him, he didn't have her records,
and she ended up having some blood tests

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.320
she had already had in a prior
visit to one of her other doctors.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.850
Marla doesn't like needles, so
she's glad this won't happen again.
