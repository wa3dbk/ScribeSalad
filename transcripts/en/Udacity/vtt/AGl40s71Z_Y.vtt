00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.860
So input checking is a defense that's
generic for all software security.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.470
That applies here as well.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.580
And there are actually other kinds of
vulnerabilities when it comes to web

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.050
application security.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.610
OWASP is the non-profit open web
application, security project.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.170
They have a list of top
10 vulnerabilities.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.450
They also talk about proactive
controls that can help

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.260
you address those vulnerabilities.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.420
And they always talk SQL injections,
or SQL injections.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.300
So to avoid that of course, parameter
checking, or argument checking,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.760
input checking,
is something that is a good defense.
