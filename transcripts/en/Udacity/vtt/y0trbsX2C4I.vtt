00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.011
Our square root method also works for equations in this form. Notice that we

00:00:04.011 --> 00:00:08.678
just have a quantity over here, squared equal to some number. This means we can

00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:12.756
take the square root of the left side and the right side. When we take the

00:00:12.756 --> 00:00:16.977
square root of this side, it undoes the square power, so we're just left with

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:22.859
this quantity, ax plus b. So, I have ax plus b on the left side of our equation

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.995
and plus or minus root c on the right side of our equation. Next we subtract b

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:32.560
from both sides, so that way we can start to isolate the X. Notice that this

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.690
negative b, is not like terms with radical c. All I can do, is list this as

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.960
negative b plus or minus the square root of c. Finally, to get x by itself, we

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.118
divide both sides by the coefficient of a. So we know x could equal negative b

00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:52.408
plus root c divided by a. Or x could equal negative b minus root c, all divided

00:00:52.408 --> 00:00:55.590
by a. There's really two solutions here.
