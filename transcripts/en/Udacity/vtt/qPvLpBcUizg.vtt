00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.417
So now we need to turn to an algorithm that allows us to have many SMs working on a single merge.

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:08.652
Our strategy here is going to be to try to break up this one

00:00:08.652 --> 00:00:12.557
huge merge task that we need to do and do a bunch of smaller merges,

00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:17.607
each of which can then be processed independently and in parallel by a different SM.

00:00:17.607 --> 00:00:22.932
So the algorithm for doing this is pretty cool. The goal is that when we're breaking up these two long lists,

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.425
this blue list and this green list, into shorter sub-lists and then merging the results,

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:31.247
that we don't have any sub-tasks that are too big to do on one SM.

00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:35.070
It's okay for us to have some smaller and some bigger sub-tasks,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.773
but we don't want a sub-task that's too big for one SM.

00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:43.280
So here's what we're going to do. We have a big, long list with tons of elements in it,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.607
and that's too big for us to be able to deal with, so what we're going to do instead

00:00:46.607 --> 00:00:49.727
is take a subset of each of these lists.

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:54.455
In fact, what we're going to do is take every nth element of each of these lists,

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:59.229
let's say every 256th element, so we're going to create much shorter lists now.

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.166
And so, we're going to call these elements that we select splitters,

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:08.203
and they are 256 elements apart. And our list here is going to be A, B, C, D, and so on.

00:01:08.203 --> 00:01:11.842
And our list here is going to be E, F, G, H, and so on.

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:15.976
So then what we're going to do is we're going to merge these splitters to get a single sorted list,

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:22.694
say E, A, B, F, C, G, D, H. Now, just as with the merge algorithm we defined a few minutes ago,

00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:25.619
we calculate the position of each splitter in the other list,

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.726
so it's very straightforward for us to use the merge algorithm we already know,

00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:33.396
to merge these two small lists of splitters.

00:01:33.396 --> 00:01:38.034
Note that the sorted splitter list already tells us in which sub-list our splitter will appear,

00:01:38.034 --> 00:01:43.003
so just as before we can do binary search for the exact position. Now, here's the cool bit.

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:48.545
What I will submit to you is that we now have a sorted list of splitters and the elements

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:53.982
that fall between any two splitters in this list are an independent set that we

00:01:53.982 --> 00:01:57.024
can send to an SM and independently sort.

00:01:57.024 --> 00:02:03.959
So, the elements between E and A can go to one SM, the elements between A and B can go to another SM, and so on.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.907
So let's look at this in a little bit more detail with the elements between F and C.

00:02:08.907 --> 00:02:15.016
We can calculate the position of F in C's list, we can calculate the position of C in F's list.

00:02:15.016 --> 00:02:21.878
And so the work that we need to do for the pair defined by F and C is to merge this list with this list,

00:02:21.878 --> 00:02:26.523
and one of our goals was to make sure that none of these sub lists would be too big,

00:02:26.523 --> 00:02:32.495
and we can guarantee that because we know that there are no more than 256 elements between F and G,

00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:36.768
and we know there are no more than 256 elements between B and C,

00:02:36.768 --> 00:02:41.297
so we can guarantee that there are no more than 512 elements between F and C,

00:02:41.297 --> 00:02:46.771
so by choosing the spacing between the splitters, we can guarantee a maximum size on

00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:52.443
any of the independent chunks that we need to independently merge in the last stage of this algorithm.

00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:58.512
So the challenge we have addressed here, we take one big problem and divide it into a large number of small problems,

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:05.322
each of which can be processed in parallel. So to sum up what we just did, we looked at 3 different phases of the merge sort,

00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:07.858
each of which we attack with a different strategy.

00:03:07.858 --> 00:03:12.561
First we used one thread block to solve many merging problems in parallel.

00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:16.233
Here the number of problems was much, much greater than the number of SMs.

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:20.300
Then we used one thread block to solve one larger merging problem.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.706
Here the number of problems was on par with the number of SMs.

00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:28.812
Finally, we cooperated between all thread blocks to solve a single problem.

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:32.816
Now we have fewer problems than SMs, so to keep all the hardware busy,

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:37.685
we needed to find a way to divide the single problem into multiple independent problems,

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:41.685
so that we could keep all the SMs busy. And that concludes the merge sort.
