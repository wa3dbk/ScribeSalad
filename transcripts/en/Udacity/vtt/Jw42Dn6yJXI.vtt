00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's go through them. This one has the red dot right at the beginning, and it's coming from state 0.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is a state that will occur in our chart, but it occurs in chart state 0.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Similarly, this one is coming from position 0. We've seen the a. We haven't seen the s or the b.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This one will be there, but it's in chart 1, and we're looking for things in chart 2.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
S goes to nothing from 1, and I haven't quite seen it yet.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This won't be in chart state 2 because only one input token is accounted for.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is still in chart state 1, but over here, this is looking very promising.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This is saying we've just finished reducing s goes to c,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and there's one more token before this that you haven't seen.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Here, we're reducing s goes to c, and here's one token before this not currently shown.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This will be in chart state 2.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, these last two really test your memory of how we compute the parsing states,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the charts, and how we keep track of this from information.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This one looks very tempting. S goes to as.b, that's definitely where we are in the input.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We're right before the b, but it says from 1.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
That means there has to be one more input character that we haven't seen, x a c,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but that's not the input we're currently seeing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
There's no other hidden character that's not shown here.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Instead, the one we really want is as.b from 0. This is the beginning of the string.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
There's an a, s goes to c. This is where we are now.

00:01:27.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And we're hoping to see b. That's definitely in chart 2.
