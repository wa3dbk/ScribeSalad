00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.090
Events in real life take the form of
specific actions occurring at specific

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:04.770
times.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.450
For instance, in the game of basketball,
when the ball goes through the hoop.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.940
The shooting team gets points.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.110
The event is the ball
going through the hoop.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.059
The resulting action is that
the scoring team gets points.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.070
The browser has events as well.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.860
Every time you move your mouse,
click on a link,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.080
submit a form, or do anything really,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.630
your browser makes an announcement
of the action you just took.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.660
I want to show you what
the browser is actually doing.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.902
Google Chrome provides a handy function.

00:00:37.902 --> 00:00:41.890
The monitorEvents function, that will
allow you to take a peek under the hood

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.450
to see events as they are taking place.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.490
You pass to the function the element
on the page that you want it to watch

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.020
for events.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.440
Now this function can only be used in
the console on the Chrome Dev Tools.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.420
Don't try to use this function
in your JavaScript file.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.950
It won't work, and
will cause a reference error.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.599
With that disclaimer out of the way, let
me show you the feedback it provides.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.590
So, on this page, you can see,
I have a simple text field.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.460
First I'll use jQuery to select
all the inputs on the page,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.980
then I'll select just
this first one here.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.865
Next I'm going to call
the monitorEvents function and

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:21.630
pass it the variable holding
the first input field.

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:27.550
The monitorEvents function watches
the element for events, and

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.870
log them all out.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.290
So, I'll interact with the text field
and watch Chrome log out all the events.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.040
As you can see using
the monitorEvents function,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.310
you can observe what the browsers doing
when you interact with the page elements

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.180
in different ways.
