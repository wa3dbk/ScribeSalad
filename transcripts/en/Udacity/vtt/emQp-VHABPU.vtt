00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.740
Moving forward.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.780
It is good that we can
access elements in a, but

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.860
another important operation is assigning
values to specific location in a.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.890
This will give us access to the element
at the position 0, 0 in the a.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.490
Using the assignment operator,
we can assign a value one to it.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.430
Let's see the output.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.560
Here you go.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.910
This is the original array where we
replaced the element at 00 with 1, but

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.070
that's not all,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.850
with the minor change you can assign
a value to the entire row or column.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.430
Let's do it.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.470
This will give us access
to the 0 true and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.750
we assign the entire row a value of 2.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.570
Let's run this.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.180
Using similar operation and

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.630
column slicing, we can also assign
an entire column a single values.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.460
Now what if we need each column or
row to have different value and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.750
not the same as we did over here?

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.120
Let's see how we can achieve this.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.570
Yes, this is a list of values.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.790
You can assign a list of
values to a row or a column.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.660
Here we assign this list of values
to column number three, but

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.530
make sure you keep
an eye on the dimension.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.560
That is, for this example,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.430
if you have five rows in an area
the list should have five elements.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.400
As you can see, all the list values
have been assigned to the third column.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.980
So now it's your turn.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.350
Go ahead and try more row and
column slicing.
