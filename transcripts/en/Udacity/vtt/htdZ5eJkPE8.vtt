00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.030
Suppose, for example, that we wanted to implement

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.882
longest prefix match for IPv4 using exact match. Now

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:10.620
in this case, we might take our network, or

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.914
our IP address, and send it to a bunch

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:15.971
of different exact match tables. And then among

00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:18.487
the tables that had a match, we would select

00:00:18.487 --> 00:00:21.680
the longest. And then forward the packet out the

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.170
appropriate output port. Of course, this is horribly inefficient,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.330
because we'd have to have tables for each

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.470
of these links. And every time a packet arrived,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.200
we'd have to send it to each one of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.490
these 32 tables. This is extremely wasteful of memory.
