00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.542
So now we will look at so called history

00:00:02.542 --> 00:00:05.879
based predictors, which are trying to do well on things

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.222
like when we have an not take and take and

00:00:08.222 --> 00:00:12.300
not take and take and repeating pattern. Or something like

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.324
two not takens followed by a taken and then again,

00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:18.850
two not takens followed by a taken, et cetera. Again,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.960
it's a repeating pattern. That even a two bit predictor

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.780
will miss predict the taken branch, so it's one term

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.090
miss predicted, and even more complicated pattern

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.880
based things. It's important to note that these

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.940
are really 100% predictable. These are repeating patterns,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.050
once you figure out what the pattern is,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.417
the branch becomes 100% predictable. It's just

00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:44.189
that these branches are not predictable with simple

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.310
N-Bit counters. What we need is a predictor

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.920
that somehow learns the pattern really. And then

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.620
it becomes a very accurate predictor. How do we

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.390
learn the pattern? Well, we don't just look at what's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.690
the majority outcome here. For example, here there is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.083
no majority outcome at all. Here, not taken is the

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:07.760
majority outcome. But takens happen very frequently, so if

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.460
we just look at what's the majority behavior, we'll have

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.060
a lot of mispredictions. What we want to look at,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.240
is the so called, history, of the branch. What were,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.650
the latest so many outcomes? For example, if we have the not taken, taken, not

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.990
taken, taken, and so on behavior. Let's ignore the first one for now. And look

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.980
at this particular prediction here. What we

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.660
know, is that the previous outcome, was not

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.304
taken. And if we know what the pattern is, then we know that when the branch

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:44.938
has been not taken previously, our prediction should

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.850
be taken. And then here, the history says the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.870
branch previously was taken, so our prediction should

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.920
be not taken. And, if you are doing it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.130
this way, then you will be predicting correctly

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.975
every single time. So what we need to learn

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:02.780
is that under the history of not taken,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.426
our decision should be taken. Under the history of

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:13.440
taken, our decision should be not taken. Let's now look at this NNT branch.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.047
In that case we have not taken, not taken, taken, not taken, not taken,

00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:24.980
taken. The history now, needs to consider the last two decisions. So when

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.090
see not taken, not taken, we should be predicting taken. When we see not taken,

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.880
taken as the previous two outcomes we should

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.558
predicting not taken. And when we see taken, not

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:41.840
taken, we should be predicting not taken. And

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.622
then we are back to not taken, not taken

00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:45.888
history where we should be predicting taken. So

00:02:45.888 --> 00:02:50.280
if we consider for different histories, different predictions, then

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.944
we will train our predictors so that for it,

00:02:52.944 --> 00:02:56.256
for this history predicts one outcome for this history

00:02:56.256 --> 00:03:01.224
predicts possibly another outcome for this history predicts a different outcome

00:03:01.224 --> 00:03:04.590
and so on. And then this becomes a very predictable branch.
