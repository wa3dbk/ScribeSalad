For functions, we learn that they have a certain rule. We start with an input,

00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:09.147
something mysterious happens, and then, we get an output. This mysterious part

00:00:09.147 --> 00:00:13.741
represents the changes we make to go from the input to the output. For example,

00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:18.179
if I had an input of 1, I could get an output of 3. Something's happened here.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.922
You might have thought that I just added 2 to the number. Well, here's some

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:29.101
other inputs. If I put in a 2, I get out a 5. And if I put in a 3, I get out a

00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:35.261
7. So the question is, what's happening to our inputs? So, based on these inputs

00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:41.134
and outputs, what rule or expression could we write for this function? If I put

00:00:41.134 --> 00:00:46.633
in x, I would get out y. What are we doing to x? That's the rule I want you to

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:47.560
write here.
