00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.959
We solved the difference of squares pattern with polynomials. We knew that a

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.346
minus b times a plus b would equal a squared minus b squared. And we even

00:00:08.346 --> 00:00:12.462
solved this for a reverse process when we factored. So let's use this to our

00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:16.585
advantage with radicals. If I want to multiply these two expressions together,

00:00:16.585 --> 00:00:21.350
what would I get for my answer? As a hint, you really just need to square a,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.634
and then square b, and subtract them. So see if you can figure these three out.

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:28.333
Good luck.
