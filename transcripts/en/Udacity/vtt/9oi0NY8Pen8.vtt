00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.320
Instead of referring to the parameter this, which gets bound to a new value

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.220
every time move is invoked, we could instead refer to the closure variable obj.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.060
Each time we call the Car like function, a new closure scope is created and

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.270
therefore the obj variable will always refer to exactly one Car object
