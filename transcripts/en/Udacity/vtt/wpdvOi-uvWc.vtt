00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.850
A number of other useful helper methods are available there too.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.580
And it's a good idea to look up the documentation about each of them.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.070
One of the most useful properties is .constructor,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.010
which makes it easy to tell what function was used to create a certain object.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.095
Like all properties,

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:18.680
.constructor actually points to a different object that's stored elsewhere.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.470
People frequently confuse the object prototype with this

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.200
constructor function used to make all objects.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.720
So let's visualize the two in different boxes for

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.570
a moment as a reminder of the way it's really laid out inside your computer.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.310
Whenever you ask an object about its .constructor property,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.600
the object most likely doesn't have a local .constructor property, so

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.262
the prototype chain gets consulted.

00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:44.820
The .constructor property on the object prototype points to the constructor

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.150
function for making object and so that object is provided as the result.
