00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.454
If you understand the SPMD model and the
asynchronous communication primitives,

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:07.590
then you're ready to write the
pseudocode for an all-to-one reduction.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.340
So recall the problem and
our algorithmic idea.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.900
There are p processes.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.490
Each process has a value, and we want to
compute the global sum of these values,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.670
leaving the result on some root process,
let's say process zero.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.090
Our algorithmic idea was to
use a tree-based reduction.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.342
The algorithm proceeds in about
log P rounds of communication.

00:00:31.342 --> 00:00:35.305
The rounds iterate over bit positions.

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:37.915
In each round there's
a current bit position.

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:43.395
Processes with a one send to processes
with a zero in that bit position.

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:46.480
Okay so let's sketch some pseudocode.

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:50.775
For simplicity, let's assume
that P has a power of two, so

00:00:50.775 --> 00:00:52.055
we'll ignore this oddball.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.650
Let's have an outer loop
that maintains a bitmask and

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.930
we'll shift the bitmask
after every round.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.210
The next part of the algorithm is to
have pairs of processes communicate.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.450
The partner of any given rank differs
only in the bitmask position, so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.740
this is an exclusive or.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.140
Remember that senders had a one
in the current bit position, so

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.280
if you're a sender,
you need to send a message.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.690
So if S is our local value,

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.010
then the send can just send that
value to a partner and then wait.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.810
Once the send is complete,
the sender drops out.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.150
Now if we're not a sender,
then we might be a receiver.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.590
And if P is a power of two,
it will turn out we must be a receiver.

00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:40.210
That case, we'll receive the value from
our partner and then accumulate it.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.370
Now in this scheme, the final
result will end up on rank zero.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.470
So for
rank zero we can print the final result.
