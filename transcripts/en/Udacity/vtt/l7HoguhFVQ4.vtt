00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.610
So now that we know that the program
generates virtual addresses but

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.700
the processor needs physical addresses
to access the actual memory,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.920
let's see how the processor does the
virtual to physical address translation.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.149
So the program generates
a virtual address.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.510
This is what the load, for example,
will compute as its address.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.870
The processor divides this
address into the page offset part

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.310
which tells us where in the page we are.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.259
The virtual page number
which tells us which page

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.660
in the process are we talking about.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.890
If we have a 4 kilobyte page 12 bits
are telling us where in the page we are,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.920
and the remaining bits are telling
us what the page number is.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.000
So let's consider the address FC51908B,
which is a 32 bit address.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.270
The least significant 12 bits are
telling us where in the 4 kilobyte page

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.969
we are, so that's the page offset.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.239
The more significant bits are telling
us what the virtual page number is.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.810
Now what happens is we take
the virtual page number and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.240
use it as an index into the page table.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.930
In this case, the index into
the page table will be FC159,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.020
so we find the entry with that index.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.180
What that entry tells us is what

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.620
the frame number is that corresponds
to this virtual page number,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.710
that is where did we put that page
in the actual physical memory.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.180
Let's say that the frame
number in this entry is 00152.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.340
We take this physical frame number and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.550
put it together with the page
offset into a physical address.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.220
And that is what we use to actually
access the physical memory.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.610
In this example,

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.840
the physical address is composed of
the frame number and the page offset.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.840
So this is a 32 bit physical address
that we will use to access the memory.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.050
Note that the page offset is
present in both the virtual and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.720
the physical address.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.900
So from the virtual address, the least
significant bits that corresponds to

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.300
the page offset do not change when we
translate into the physical address.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.820
But the virtual page number

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.240
does change because it gets
translated into the frame number.
