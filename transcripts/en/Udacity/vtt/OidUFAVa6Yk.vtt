00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This next question is about an application of symmetric ciphers.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
To exploit the BEAST vulnerability in HTTPS,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
suppose an attacker has intercepted the ciphertext, using 4-bit blocks.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
C0, the first block of the intercepted ciphertext, is 1000

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as the result of encrypting m0, the first block in the message.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
C1 is the result of encrypting the second block of the message,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and C2 the result of encrypting the third block of the message.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Our attacker wants to find if m1, the second block in the intercepted message

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is equal to 1010.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The question is what should the attacker use as the target value for m0',

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which is the first block and the next response.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Your answer should be 4 bits long.
