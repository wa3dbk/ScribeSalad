00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is only the second one is true.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The first answer is not true.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In fact, the EKE protocol is designed primarily with this goal

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
of not being vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The reason for that is if you look at the 2 messages that are sent,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the value that's encrypted with a password is the result of a Diffie-Hellman exponentiation.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If we believe the Diffie-Hellman assumption, that's indistinguishable from random.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
An attacker who intercepts these messages

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
could try all possible passwords in the dictionary.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Even if one of those is correct, the attacker couldn't tell which.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The attacker obtains the encrypted messages, which are these Diffie-Hellman exponentials.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
From those there's no way to obtain the key, so there's no way to know

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
if the guess was correct, and it should be indistinguishable from any other guess.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So that's a good property.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It also satisfies this other property that it is actually not vulnerable

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to the meet-in-the-middle attack that Diffie-Hellman was vulnerable to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because in this case if the attacker tries to relay something without knowing the password,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that will lead to some other key being computed not known to the attacker,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and the attacker won't be able to set up the middle attack.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The main drawback of this protocol is it does require the server to keep the password.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
In order to decrypt this message encrypted with a password,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the server needs to use the password to do decryption.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So this means the server would need to store all the passwords in clear text.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is highly undesirable.

00:01:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If the server was compromised, all the passwords would be lost.
