00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.300
Now that you're equipped with some basic skills necessary to acquire

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.050
and clean up data, we'll use these tools in order to

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.190
begin working on our class project, analyzing the dynamics and workings

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.260
of the New York City subway system. First, you'll use your

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.520
knowledge of how to acquire data via an API, to obtain

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.362
weather underground data on New York City, for a month in

00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:22.655
2011, and write it to a file. We'll then use our

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.400
SQL skills to run some basic queries on the data and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.680
get a sense from what our day looks

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.080
like. Once you're comfortable with the weather data, you'll

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.690
grab a bunch of data related to the

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.410
MTA subway itself from the MTA website. In addition

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.438
to gaining some basic familiarity with the MTA

00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:39.830
data, you'll do some processing and cleaning of that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.842
data. Such that it'll be very easy to do

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:44.090
analysis on the data in the very near future.
