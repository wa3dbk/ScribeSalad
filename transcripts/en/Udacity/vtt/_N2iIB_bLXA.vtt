00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.660
So how does machine learning actually
differ from traditional programming?

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.000
Well when we write
a traditional program,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.039
we usually build the decision-making
directly into the program.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.760
So if we wanted to develop a program
that could recognize my face.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.920
We would tell it, look for glasses, look
for brown eyes, look for brown hair.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.050
With machine learning though, we
wouldn't actually tell it any of that.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.920
We would build an agent that could look
at a bunch of images over time, and

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.180
figure out who I am on its own.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.390
We would give it a bunch
of pictures of myself and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.060
a bunch of pictures of other people and
let it figure out on its own.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.360
Hey, he's the guy with the brown hair,
and the brown eyes and the glasses.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.130
Now setting apart machine
learning also is the fact that,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.020
it's only recently become feasible for
us to be able to address

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.890
these very large data sets
with computational methods.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.760
Computers have finally come along and
become fast enough to be able to address

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.130
the kinds of data sets that
we have available to us now.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.600
And also helping it is the fact that the
world is more reliant on computers than

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.240
ever before, so
much data is generated kind of

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.020
automatically while people are going
about their everyday lives.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.050
So these things really unite to make
machine learning a much more useful tool

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.090
right now than it would
have ever been before.
