00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One cannot discuss anti-lock braking without asking whether or not

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
such an improved safety feature actually saves human lives.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Some researchers argue that humans tend to stick to a certain riskiness of the behavior.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The envelope of what can be considered risky behavior is pushed up

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with introduction of anti-lock braking.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And many drivers are going to stay with the original level of riskiness, which means that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
with the introduction of anti-lock braking systems, they are going to drive faster and brake harder

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
relying on the improved brakes.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In the end, it all boils down to saying that psychology matters.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
To improve safety, we cannot only look at technology or to cite an example from history--

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
when your ship is supposedly unsinkable, why should you care about icebergs?
