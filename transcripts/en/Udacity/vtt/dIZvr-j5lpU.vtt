00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.956
We'll start with a pattern of a counter. That pattern teaches us to make an

00:00:03.956 --> 00:00:11.052
integer variable that counts whatever it is that we want to count. You want to

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:14.778
have another method that increments the counter when whatever interesting event

00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:21.194
happens that you're counting. And you'll usually want a method that returns the

00:00:21.194 --> 00:00:26.578
current counter value so that the user of the class can get at it. Okay, that's

00:00:26.578 --> 00:00:30.663
all really abstract, so let's look at a concrete example. Here, I have the

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:35.064
beginning of a Car class. A car has a given number of seats. That of course is

00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:38.812
not my integer counter, because that number doesn't change. And then I have a

00:00:38.812 --> 00:00:44.772
method here called addPassenger. Whenever that method gets called, another

00:00:44.772 --> 00:00:50.789
passenger enters the car. And then I have a method for counting the number of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.635
passengers in this car, not counting the driver. What I'd like you to do is,

00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:02.360
use this pattern and add an instance variable for the counter, which you can

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:10.354
call anything that you think is appropriate. And to implement the methods that

00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:16.722
increment the counter and that returns current value.
