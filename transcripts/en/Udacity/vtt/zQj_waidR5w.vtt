00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.710
If you're ready, let's go through the code to reshape our

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.590
data frame into a new one. First, let's install and load the

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.340
R reshape two package. Now, let's create a variable for a

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.300
new data frame that will be in wide format. I'll use the

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.950
same variable name for the data frame and just add wide

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.760
to the end. Now, we're going to make use of the dcast

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.310
function, which comes with the R shape two package. The letter d

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.760
is used since we want the result to be a data frame.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.250
If we wanted an array or a matrix we could use a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.890
cast. We specify the data set we are going to change and then

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.820
we put in a formula. So, here's the data frame I want to

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.960
modify and then this is where I'll enter my formula. Now, the first

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.200
part of the formula, or the part to the left of the Tilly

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.220
sign, will list the variables I want to keep with an addition side in

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.050
between them. Here I just want to keep h. On the right side

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.400
of the tilda, we use the gender variable since we want male and

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.430
female users to have their own columns for median friend count

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.180
in the data frame. And finally, we set value dot var equal

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.360
to median friend count because value dot var holds the key measurements

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.019
or their values in our new data frame. And it looks like

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.900
that I forgot quotes around this variable. So let me add

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.210
that. Now, we should get a new data frame. And let's look

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.020
at some of these data frames, so that way, we can make

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.590
sure we understand this dcast function. Here are some of the rows

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.970
printed out and notice I have my age column, my female median friend count and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.190
my male median friend count. See if you can recreate these steps on your own and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.990
try playing around with the D cast and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.640
Nill functions, and the reshape to package. The

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.430
Nill function will allow you to convert the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.210
Y data back to the original long format
