00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.920
So when we have multiple reducers, say these

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.380
two, and the mapper might output keys apple,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.850
banana, carrot and grape. Which keys, will go

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.380
to the first reducer? Here are some options. Maybe

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.840
apple and banana go to the first reducer,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.870
or apple and carrot, carrot and grape. Or

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.890
apple and grape, or, we don't know specifically,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.450
but they'll be split evenly with each reducer getting

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.510
two of the keys. Or we don't know, and it's

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.730
possible that one reducer could get none of the keys.
