00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.516
The corticotropin releasing factor is released from the hypothalamus, which

00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:12.308
causes the pituitary gland to release the adrenocorticotropic hormone. Then the

00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:18.243
ACTH causes the adrenal gland to release cortisol. And those are the steps

00:00:18.243 --> 00:00:22.703
involved in our response to stress via the HPA axis.
