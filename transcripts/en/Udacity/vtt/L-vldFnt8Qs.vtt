Now that we set up the desktop and
Android backends,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.470
you are probably wondering about
the iOS and HTML backends.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.812
Well, the HTML backend is kind of hard
to run because you need to be running

00:00:09.812 --> 00:00:11.760
Gradle tasks from the command line.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.085
The IOS backend is even more difficult
because we need to first provision

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:18.755
a device for debugging,
which requires Xcode and some time.

00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:22.690
Also, as you might be aware, all the iOS
system APIs can only be accessed from

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.205
Objective-C or Swift, which makes
running a Java game kind of tricky.

00:00:27.295 --> 00:00:29.775
We're not going to set up the iOS or
HTML backends for now.

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:32.445
But we've created bonus levels
explaining how to set up both,

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:35.095
which you can check out by following
the links in the instructor notes.
