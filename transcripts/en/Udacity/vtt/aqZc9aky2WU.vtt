So now that you've sent requests to
a local host server, let's try seeing if

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.560
we can get information from other
servers out on the Internet.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.700
Let's say I want to try to
access the API for SoundCloud,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.480
an online audio distribution platform
that enables its users to upload,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.700
record, promote and
share their originally created sounds.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.540
In order to figure out what requests
I can send to the SoundCloud server I

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.980
will go to their developer website and
search through the documentation.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.620
To control and

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.150
protect their resources, SoundCloud
requires developers to register

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.960
each application they want to create
that will communicate with their API.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.560
Once my account is created, I'm
provided a Client ID and Client Secret.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.310
I can embed these credentials into my
request in order to successfully access

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.290
the SoundCloud API.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.390
Now, searching through
the documentation,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.210
I see the resources that are available
for me to access, along with some

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.810
examples on how to create requests
to access this information.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.770
Many of the post, put and delete methods
are protected with access tokens.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.850
Since my app would need permission from
end users in order to post information

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.570
to SoundCloud on their behalf.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.770
So for now I'm just going to build
a get request to view the contents of

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.190
a playlist with
the following playlist ID.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.910
I must also add my client ID so
SoundCloud could

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.550
recognize that it's my application
trying to communicate with the server.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.950
I can build the request using Curl or
Postman, send if off, and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.200
see that I received
a successful response.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.540
If I open the permalink URL provided in
the response, I can also see the HTML

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.020
page that contains this playlist
information in my browser.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.130
In this next video, you'll be able
to delve into some APIs on your own.
