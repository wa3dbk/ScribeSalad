00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.800
Let's also talk about the cost of refactoring. Refactoring might be

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.750
free or almost free if you're using a tool to do refactoring

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.570
as we did in our demo. But that's not always the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.530
case. In many cases, refactoring involves quite a bit of manual work

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.309
if you're doing some manual refactoring. And how much that costs

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.460
depends on how well the operations on the source code are supported.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.379
You might have partial support from an ID. You might have complete

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:25.017
support, in which case it's greater. Or you might have no support,

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:26.879
in which case you have to be very careful about

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.888
how you change your code and how you check that you

00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:32.030
didn't change the behavior of the code. There's also an additional

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.460
cost associated with refactoring. Remember

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.990
that refactoring relies heavily on testing

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.808
after each small step of refactoring. So you might have

00:00:39.808 --> 00:00:43.451
to develop test cases, specifically to check your refactoring. And even

00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:47.163
if you have an existing test because, for example, you're working

00:00:47.163 --> 00:00:50.235
some agile context and therefore you develop a lot of UNIX

00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:53.550
test cases before writing your code. And therefore you have a good

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.635
regression test with it you can use every time you modify your code.

00:00:56.635 --> 00:00:59.550
Nevertheless, when you refactor and you change your code, you might need

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.255
to update your test so it's not only the development of the test

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:05.379
cases but also it's maintaining the test cases. And if you have

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.970
a lot of test cases, you have to maintain more test cases. So

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.460
that's a cost that is not directly visible but can affect quite

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.800
a bit the overall cost of refactoring and the overall cost of system

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.342
development therefore. And finally, you should not

00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:21.191
under estimate the cost of documentation maintenance.

00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:24.241
Applying refactoring may involve changes in interfaces,

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:26.528
names, for example, names of classes. And

00:01:26.528 --> 00:01:29.384
when you make this kind of changes, you might need to update the documentation,

00:01:29.384 --> 00:01:30.890
and that's also cost. It's something that

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.900
takes effort and therefore should be considered.
