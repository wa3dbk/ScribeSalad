00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So here's that javascript code from before,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
with the anonymous function assigned

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to "greeter" nested inside "makegreeter."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to draw the environment much more formally.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In our global environment, "greeting" points to "hola."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
"Makegreeter" is a function with three other components

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that I'm not showing right now,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and "sayhello"--well, to figure out its value,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm going to have to call "makegreeter" on "hello."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Whenever I call a function, I make a new frame

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
with just enough room for all of the formal parameters.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Then inside this frame I'm adding a new

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
local variable, "greeter," which is a function with one parameter.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And even with our environment bug,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
even with the bug that we've been considering,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
this is still going to point back to the global frame.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So this value of "greeter"--this function defined here--will be copied back.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And these things I've marked in green have the same value.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This was the return value of "makegreeter," so it's what "sayhello" currently has.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And now we're going to call "sayhello" on "gracie."

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So we're going to make a new frame

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
where a person points to "gracie" pointing back to the global frame.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And here's the question for you--

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
one of these arrows, or possibly both, is incorrect,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
if we have the bug we've currently been talking about.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We have the bug.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Check the arrow--check the parent pointer edge

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that would be different if we didn't have the bug.

00:01:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
If we fixed the bug, how does the world change--quiz?
