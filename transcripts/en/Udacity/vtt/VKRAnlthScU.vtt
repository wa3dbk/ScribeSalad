Multiplication of expressions was something we focused on, pretty early on in

00:00:03.172 --> 00:00:08.486
the course. But, division didn't come up until much more recently. Let's say

00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:13.880
this time, that f of x is equal to 2x cubed, plus 12x squared, minus 8x, minus

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:21.942
48. And g of x is equal to 2x minus 4. What do we get then if we say, f of x

00:00:21.942 --> 00:00:27.080
over g of x? Make sure, as before, to simplify your answer.
