00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.050
So once Alice has programmed this algorithm--here--she, of course, tests it.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.850
So she constructs small test instances that she can solve herself

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.670
and runs them through this algorithm.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.790
Now, one thing I would like you to figure out--

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.970
now if she actually runs a small test instance through this algorithm--

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.030
is how many loops that algorithm goes through.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.870
And by 'loops' I mean how many times those lines--3 to 5, here--are executed

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.780
for a certain network.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.590
So let's say that the network consists of 5 communication centers.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.270
So for a network with 5 communication centers, I want to know how often

00:00:39.270 --> 99:59:59.000
lines 3 to 5--this part here--are executed.
