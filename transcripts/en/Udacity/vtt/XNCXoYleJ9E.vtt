00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.570
We've got a lot of code for the person class now. We probably want to put it in

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.113
BlueJ. And make sure that we haven't made any mistakes. So for BlueJ, I'll

00:00:07.113 --> 00:00:13.994
create a new project, and I'll call it Friends. I need to make a class for the

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:26.560
person and then put my code into the class. I'll add the instance variables.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:36.234
The add friend method. And let's just check that it's compiling so far. So far

00:00:36.234 --> 00:00:50.070
so good. We'll add the unfriend method. Check that it's still compiling. Now

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:59.998
I'll go back and put in the constructor. So far so good. Now I should be able

00:00:59.998 --> 00:01:23.130
to make a person object. And I should be able to add a friend. It's hard to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.590
tell whether anything happened yet or not. Maybe we haven't finished yet.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.863
Clearly, there's still more to do.
