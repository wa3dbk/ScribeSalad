00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.767
The first graph crosses the y axis at this point. We moved 0 horizontally and 3

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:11.179
up vertically, so our y-intercept is 0, 3. For the other graph, we moved 0

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.939
horizontally and then down 1 or negative 1 in the y direction, so 0, negative 1

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.039
is our y intercept. Great work if you got both of those.
