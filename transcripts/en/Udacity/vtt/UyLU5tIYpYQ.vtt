00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.020
UML supports a couple of special transitions that you can take advantage of,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.130
each indicated by a keyword. So,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.904
here's a two state machine. The transition from the active state to idle state.

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:19.290
the, transition is labeled after 2 seconds. Okay? So you can assume

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.460
that there's a timer here that if you're in the active state 2 seconds later,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.235
you'll make the transition to the idle state. Similarly, the idle state has

00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:35.900
a self transition, okay? That's labeled when we key, the keyword when and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.420
then a particular clock time that the system

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.710
waits until that particular clock time happens before making the transition.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.380
We can put this example in a slightly larger context of to ill, to illustrate

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.630
one other feature of, state charts. So, we have the self transition on idle and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.750
we have some, normal, transitions labeled by events in the rest of the diagram.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.504
But the transition between idle and tracking, okay? Involves an action, okay?

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:15.260
That action is invocating a method, invoking a method, and the method

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.590
has a parameter p, that is you can pass information in the action calls.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.470
Similarly, on the transition itself, the event that led to the transition has

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.050
an argument p. So, what we're doing here is we're passing on the information.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.380
That came in on the event to some kind of method call so

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.080
it can presumably be processed in the tracking state
