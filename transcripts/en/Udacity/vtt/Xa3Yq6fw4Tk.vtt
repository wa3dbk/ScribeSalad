00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.160
It is considered a little bit more realistic problem. Imagine that you were to

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.200
hire a robot, and a task of the robot was to paint the ceiling in your room, and

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.020
also paint the ladder. So, two goals here,

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.840
paint the ladder paint the ceiling and note that the two goals are in conflict.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.952
Because if the robot paints the ladder first, the ladder will become wet.

00:00:20.952 --> 00:00:25.130
And this robot cannot climb on it, in order to paint the ceiling. So, the robot

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.400
must really first paint the ceiling, then climb down, then paint the ladder and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.740
everything is okay. You would expect a human to get this almost immediately,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.550
you probably got it almost immediately. You have to paint the ceiling first,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.650
before you paint the ladder. Of course, every time I've hired construction

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.300
workers, they always paint the ladder first. Then they go and take a break, and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.200
so that I had to pay them anyway. We'll accept that kind of behavior from human

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.140
construction workers, we would not accept that from robot construction workers.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.310
The robots must be intelligent, they must know how to prioritize the goals.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.980
Well, in order to reason about these goals, the robot first must be able to

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.690
represent them. So, how can we present the goal of painted ceiling? Now that we

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.360
have learned about propositional logic, here is a preposition that can

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.730
represent painted ceiling. This is the object, this is the predicate on that.
