We know 4 divides into 8 two times. So we put a 2 above the 8. 2 times 4 is 8,

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.644
so we subtract 8 from 8 to get 0. To continue our long division problem, we

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:15.143
bring down the 5 and then ask, 4 divides into 5 how many times? Well, that's

00:00:15.143 --> 00:00:20.401
just once. 1 times 4 is 4, and then we can do our subtraction. 5 minus 4 equals

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:25.828
1. We bring down the 2 to continue our long division. And finally, 4 divides

00:00:25.828 --> 00:00:30.120
into 12 three times. So our final answer is 213.
