00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.830
Do you remember this diagram from lesson one? The adapter

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.520
has a reference to the raw data. And has instructions on

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.020
how to build each list item layout. These layouts eventually make

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.840
it into the list view here. But what happens if any

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.490
of this data changes. Let's say for example, there's a fourth

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.120
contact named Don. The adapter knows how to create a list

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.090
item layout for Don. But now the list view is outdated

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.170
because it only has three items. Somehow, we need the adapter.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.190
To notify the list view that things have

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.728
changed. And lucky for us, there's a method

00:00:31.728 --> 00:00:37.590
called: adapter.notifyDatasetChanged( ). This notifies any attached observers,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.460
like this one, that the underlying adapter data has

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.340
changed. Then the list view needs to populate

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.100
its children again. So it asks the adapter

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.990
how many items there are? And the adapter

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.210
responds with four. Then the ListView goes and fetches

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.940
each one individually until it fills up the screen.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.300
And it's through that method that the ListView is able

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.250
to get all its list items. But now you

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.270
must be thinking. How did we actually update the ListView

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.230
successfully, without adding this line of code in our

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.290
app? Well, with a ray adapter, whenever you add or

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.190
remove elements from it, it internally calls notifyDataSetChanged. That means

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.260
we don't have to do anything. But how can be

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.050
confirm this? Well, we can check the actual implementation

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.470
of the ArrayAdapter class in the framework. And here's

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.190
the code for the ArrayAdapter class within the Android

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.930
framework. You can follow along with the link below.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.910
First, we're going to search for the Add method. Remember,

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.730
we added forecast strings. To the adapter using this

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.790
method. And sure enough we see that, the notify

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.140
data set changed method is called internally. But you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.740
might be thinking what about this Boolean here. Well

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.180
let's look it up. If you scroll to the top

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.270
you'll see that, notify on change is declared as

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.640
true initially. As you go through your other references you'll

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.800
see that it's only changed here. In this set

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.410
notify on change method. Since we don't call this public

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.600
method, with the value false, then we know that we're

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.440
going to be safely notified each time the adapter updates.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.220
Now let's go back to the add method. I want to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.280
show you one more thing. You'll notice in the add

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.660
all method, it only notifies its observers once. Whereas in

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.930
the add method every time you call this it will update

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.700
it's observers. That means that our code actually is refreshing

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.350
the list every time. So, if you're targeting honeycomb of above

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.180
you can use this method to be a little more

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.890
efficient. In general don't be afraid to try and do this

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.710
on your own. As a general pro tip, if you're ever unsure about something,

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.930
feel free to go and check the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.760
Android source code. Don't treat the framework code

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.320
like a black box. Take advantage of the fact that Android is open source. The

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.910
more you learn about the platform the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.690
better of an Android developer you can become.
