00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.667
&gt;&gt; So let's assume that we're using
semantic network as a representation for

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:05.394
this particular class of problem.

00:00:05.394 --> 00:00:11.250
Given that, how would you apply generate
and matter to this problem, David?

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.970
&gt;&gt; So it sounds like would
I would do is I would

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.990
use the transformation between A and B,
transfer that transformation to C and

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.540
use it to generate my answer for D.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.012
I then take my answer for D and compare
it against 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and

00:00:27.012 --> 00:00:30.030
see which one most closely
matched what I generated.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.298
If I wanted to make my tester and
generator even smarter,

00:00:33.298 --> 00:00:36.156
I might say that in order
to be the correct answer,

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:40.257
it has to meet the generated answer
with a certain level of confidence.

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:43.503
And if it doesn't meet that level of
confidence, it should go back and see if

00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:46.364
there's a different transformation
we could have transferred.

00:00:46.364 --> 00:00:49.516
That would take care of the problem
earlier where either the middle shape

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.542
disappeared or
the outer shape disappeared.

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:52.923
&gt;&gt; That's a good answer, David.

00:00:52.923 --> 00:00:54.943
It is another way of
solving this problem.

00:00:54.943 --> 00:00:58.395
It is another way of solving
this problem using test and

00:00:58.395 --> 00:00:59.576
semantic networks.

00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:02.467
One could take one, put it under D.

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:05.322
Generate the transformation
from C to D and

00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:08.817
then test it against
the transformation from A to B.

00:01:08.817 --> 00:01:12.476
One could do the same thing with 2,
put 2 here into D,

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:17.107
directly transformation tested
against the transformation A to B.

00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:20.803
One could do this for
all six choices and then find out, which

00:01:20.803 --> 00:01:26.240
one of these transformations is closest
with the transformation from A to B.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.970
Thus, in this problem, one can use
[INAUDIBLE] test methods in two very

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.120
different ways, all of the knowledge
representation ribbon is the same.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.500
So knowledge representation captures
some knowledge about the world

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.600
at a level of abstraction.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.610
It is coupled with problem
solving methods, but

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.270
more than one problem solving method,
more than one variation of a problem

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.460
solving method might be applicable
using technology representation.
