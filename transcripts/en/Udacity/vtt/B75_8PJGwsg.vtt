00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.930
Let's look at the solution to our distributed last

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.740
level cache. We have 16 cores in a four

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.992
by four mesh. It doesn't really matter what the

00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:11.991
organization of the network is. We need to know that

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:15.207
there are really 16 tiles, numbered 0 through 15,

00:00:15.207 --> 00:00:18.892
and that we have an 8-megabyte cache with 256-byte block,

00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:22.924
16-way set associative distributed round robin by set. So

00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:25.696
set zero will be in slice zero, set one will

00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:31.970
be in slice one, etc., and then it just wraps arround. So let's look at

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.530
what this address maps to. The least significant

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.230
eight bits are telling us what the block

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.244
offset is. The next so-many bits are going to

00:00:42.244 --> 00:00:45.208
be the index, and the least significant bits

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:51.061
of the index are going to tell us which tile to look at. There are 16 tiles,

00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:56.700
so the next digit is really the tile number. And that means

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.630
that we go to tile number six. Note that we don't really

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.629
need to even compute what exactly is the index because the least

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.620
significant bits in this case are telling us what we need to know.
