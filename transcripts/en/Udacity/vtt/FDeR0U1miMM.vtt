Thinking about what lesson you may have learned from the last several quizzes,

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:08.013
I'd like you to solve for x with this equation. 3 times the quantity 2x plus 4

00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:12.087
equals 2 times the quantity x minus 5. Be sure that you write out everything on

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.870
paper to make sure that you're not missing any steps.
