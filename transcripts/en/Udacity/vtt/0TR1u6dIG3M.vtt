00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.966
And the answer is if the pattern is the empty string, then that matches anything,

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:09.532
because the empty string occurs in every text, even if the text is itself empty.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.466
So we just return "true" no matter what.

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:18.399
If the pattern is the dollar sign, that means that matches only at the very end of the text.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.366
So we want to return "true" only if the text is the empty string.

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:30.132
So we say "return does the text equal the empty string?" True if that's true, false if that's false.

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:36.866
And I put parentheses around it just as a convention of when you're checking in a return value.

00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:40.667
It makes it a little bit easier to see that this is a return value.
