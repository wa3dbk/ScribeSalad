00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.150
Now let's make another type of ad,
the banner ad.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.600
This time, let's build it into an actual
game that was built with libgdx.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.050
Let's create a banner ad for
the game Icicles,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.540
where you just move your player
around and dodge icicles.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.300
I already have the code open for
the game Icicles.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.210
So let's change it a bit and add
a banner ad at the top of the screen.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.650
The first thing I've done is
to include our ads library.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.050
And I've also updated our Android
manifest file to include the ad activity

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.110
and the permissions we'll need.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.980
So now we can access all
the ad objects we need and

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.870
retrieve an ad to display
from the Internet.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.069
And now we're ready to start
programming a banner ad.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.490
And we'll be doing all of our ad
programming in our Android launcher

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.330
class which contains
our onCreate method.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.310
We'll be treating this class like
a view that we can display ads in, and

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.050
to create our initial view we'll need to
change our initialization code a little.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.250
Instead of just saying initialize,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.330
we're going to create a view
with initializeForView.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.400
We're going to create
a view called GameView, and

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.700
then pass in the new Icicles game and
config, like we did before.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.120
Great, then next, we need to do what
we did in our previous project,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.340
which is to register our app.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.900
This let's us receive ads, and I'll
use the same sample key I did before.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.698
Next let's create our banner ad.

00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:23.700
The first step, just like in
our interstitial ad project,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.900
is to create a private class variable.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.340
But instead of an interstitial ad
this is going to be an AdLayout, and

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.550
I'll give it the name bannerAd.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.880
An interstitial ad automatically
took up the whole screen but

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.408
a banner ad only takes up a small part.

00:01:39.408 --> 00:01:43.230
And an AdLayout object let's us decide
the size and placement of our ad.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.570
Then I'll go back into our onCreate
method and make a new banner ad, where

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.710
I say this activity .bannerAdVariable
is equal to a new AdLayout object.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.220
Next we have to define where we want
our ad to appear in our gameView.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.970
To do this, we first have to
define a relative layout.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.776
Our RelativeLayout, which I've called
layout, will include all the views and

00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:12.020
layouts that appear on our screen.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.534
So it's going to include our
gameView that we created here and

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:16.960
our bannerAd AdLayout.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.970
To include these we need to add them
to our layout by saying layout.addView,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.850
then giving our view followed by the
width and height we want them to occupy.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.920
First to add our gameView I'm
going to specify width and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.070
height that take up the whole screen.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.280
And since I want this to work
across screens, big or small,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.135
I'm going to use parameters that Android
provides to automatically size our ad.

00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:45.490
MATCH_PARENT will automatically
fit the whole screen.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.330
So, since I want the gameView
to take up the whole screen

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.580
I'm going to say with and
height are both equal to MATCH_PARENT.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.160
Then for my bannerAd, I'm going
to define the dimensions first.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.880
I want it to be as
wide as our screen but

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.280
take up as little height as possible.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.622
So I'll give it a width of MATCH_PARENT
and a height of WRAP_CONTENT.

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:09.540
And WRAP_CONTENT means
that the height is

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.720
only as big as it needs to be to fit
all the content in the banner ad.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.820
It wraps around the content.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.280
Then I can add our AdLayout
by saying layout.AddView,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.390
our banner ad, and then the dimensions.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.130
And finally after defining
the placement of my ad and

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.000
the views, I still want them
to display on my screen.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.830
And I do this by saying setContentView
and passing in a RelativeLayout.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.966
Then we need to do one more thing,
which is load our ad.

00:03:38.966 --> 00:03:42.030
And this is the same as
with an interstitial ad.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.030
We just say our variable,
bannerAd.loadAdd.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.380
But unlike our interstitial ad,
a banner ad will load and

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.540
show automatically once it's loaded.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.910
So we don't need a listener unless
we want a really specific behavior.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.140
And now we're done.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.963
Let's see what this looks
like when we run our game,

00:03:58.963 --> 00:04:00.896
using BlueStacks emulator again.

00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:04.697
And now you can see we
get our Icicles game,

00:04:04.697 --> 00:04:07.650
now with a banner ad right
at the top of our screen.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.282
Great job.

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:11.060
Now you know how to use
the Amazon Mobile Ads API

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.950
to make the two most common types of
ads, banner ads and interstitial.
