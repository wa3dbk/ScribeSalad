00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.640
Okay, let's recap what we've
learned about Q-Learning.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.840
First, let's consider what
it takes to build a model.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.590
First step is define states,
actions, and rewards.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.780
So states are combinations
of our features.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.450
Actions are buy, sell, do nothing.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.760
And rewards are some type of return.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.320
Next you choose the training period and
you iterate over that

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.120
training period and
update your Q-table on each iteration.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.380
When you reach the end of that
training period you backtest

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.380
to see how good the model is and
you go back and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.430
repeat, until the model
quits getting better.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.600
Once it's converged you stop,
you've got your model.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.520
Testing the model is simple you
just backtest it on later data.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.610
Remember we're always training
on one set of data and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.830
then testing on later data.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.690
And that's it.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.770
I hope you enjoyed the lesson.
