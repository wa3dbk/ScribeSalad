Great job completing Descriptive Statistics. I really hope you've enjoyed

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.380
this experience. Having taken this course, you should now know how

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.080
to summarize data by measuring its center and its variance.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.438
You should be familiar with how to use Google Spreadsheets to

00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:16.430
handle data sets as well as how to visualize data.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.350
And finally, you should have introductory knowledge of probability and how

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.110
it can be applied to normalized data. In the final

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.088
project, you will conduct an experiment using a deck of cards.

00:00:26.088 --> 00:00:28.360
You will sample and describe your own

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.000
data using visualizations and descriptive statistics. Now

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.030
once you completed the final project, you'll

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.810
be ready to move on to Inferential Statistics,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.130
where you will learn how to make predictions using data. There's a link to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.960
this course in the instructor's notes box.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.260
We really look forward to seeing you there.
