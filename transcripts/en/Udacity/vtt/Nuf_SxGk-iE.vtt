00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.070
In fact the this, this notion that there
are three receptors that are absorbing

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.170
light, refer, results in what's referred
to as the tristimulus color theory.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.000
The idea is that it's three inputs.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.800
And you know,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.950
here it says the spectral-response
of each of the three types of cones.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.410
Unlike the previous one where we're
showing you the relative sensitivity of

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.050
each of them, what this graph is
showing you, just as it says, this is

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.150
the percentage of light absorbed by
each cone, actually by each cone type.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.330
The reason that even though blue is so

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.430
much more sensitive down here,
because there's so few blue cones.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.570
The amount of light down here absorbed
by the blue cones compare to the amount

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.700
absorbed by red cones and green cones is
approximately equal because there's so

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.570
many more green cones and
red cones than there are blue cones.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.960
So the question then is,
is can we, how, it says can,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.830
but how would we use the outputs of,
of these three types of receptors

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.080
in order to see color,
in particular like spectral color.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.230
And what I mean by spectral color is,
you're all familiar with this red,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.130
orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, violet.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.380
You probably learned that somewhere
along the way as the colors in

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.950
the rainbow.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.730
Well what it really is, is these
are different wavelengths of light.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.650
And those are the colors that you see

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.220
when those wavelengths are put out,
okay?

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.570
And I'll, I'll, I'll, we'll,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.007
we'll see a little bit more about
what we mean by that, all right?
