00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.191
Throughout this section, we moved from factored form to standard form. We

00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:08.606
multiplied binomials to find the product, or answer. The key idea here is that

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:12.809
both of these forms are equal. They are a different way of writing the same

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.796
thing. As factors, these represent the sides of a rectangle. But right now as a

00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:21.999
sum, this represents the area of the rectangles. I think this is an amazing part

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:26.042
about math. It's two ways of writing the exact same thing. This idea of factors

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:30.137
is really important, and it's one we're going to see throughout the rest of the

00:00:30.137 --> 00:00:34.185
course. In fact, in just the next unit, instead of going from factored form to

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:37.324
standard form, we're going to go in the reverse direction.
