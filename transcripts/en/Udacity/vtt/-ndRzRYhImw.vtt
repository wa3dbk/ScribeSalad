00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.970
What did you find, David?

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.050
&gt;&gt; So we've got A right here and
Y right here.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.920
We've got a line that goes through
the two that differentiates them

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.060
that roughly lines up with 2E.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.280
So I said 2E.
&gt;&gt; That looks like a good answer to me.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.880
Recall that when we were using the table
to organize the case memory previously,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.639
we were very concerned that this side
of the table would grow very large.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.080
It will become very difficult to search
for a specific case in that table.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.700
The potential answer to that.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.380
By asking a question we are quickly
able to prune away one part of the tree.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.510
That makes this search
process much more efficient.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.790
And that's the point of
the discrimination tree.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.030
In both organizational scheme,
the table and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.527
the discrimination tree, we are trying
to accommodate and accumulate new cases.

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:52.520
But in the case of the discrimination
tree, by asking the right

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.020
questions to the right nodes, we make
the search process more efficient.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.480
&gt;&gt; So for those of you
familiar with big O notation,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.420
you'll notice that the efficiency of
searching the case library organized

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.670
by indices was linear,
whereas here it's logarithmic.
