00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.214
So you've seen that the constant turn that we would get if we multiplied this

00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:06.142
entire right hand side of the equation out, is the product of the constant

00:00:06.142 --> 00:00:09.166
terms negative six, two and negative four from each of the original factors

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:14.675
that we had. So that means that this number 48 here is pretty intimately

00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:19.343
related to the factors of this polynomial. That means that we should be able to

00:00:19.343 --> 00:00:24.250
use some information involving 48 to get to the roots of this polynomial.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.360
There's gotta be a pretty close connection there. So let's say we have some

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.900
fourth degree polynomials to add. Maybe it's this one, f of x equals x to the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.470
4th minus 23x squared plus 18x plus 40. And maybe I've also come up with some

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.496
guesses for how to factor this polynomial. Let me write them down for you.

00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:45.304
Which of these three choices down here do you think is the correct

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:49.527
factorization of this function? Remember to think about what we need in terms

00:00:49.527 --> 00:00:51.303
of this constant up here.
