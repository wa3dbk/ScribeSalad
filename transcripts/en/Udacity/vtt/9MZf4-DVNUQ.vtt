One effective way to handle stress and beat the negative impact stress has on

00:00:03.996 --> 00:00:08.737
our bodies is through exercise. There is a great deal of research out there

00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:12.395
showing just how important exercise can be in reducing the physiological

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:17.601
negative responses to stress. In fact exercise is beneficial to our overall

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:22.429
brain health specifically for our hippocampus. Engaging in regular exercise can

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.248
have great benefits to our bodies including lowering the risk of heart disease,

00:00:26.248 --> 00:00:31.064
stroke and certain types of cancers. It can also ward off the onset of

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:35.496
diabetes. And, in fact, it can improve our overall emotional health, which can

00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:38.960
result in a decrease likelihood of depression.
