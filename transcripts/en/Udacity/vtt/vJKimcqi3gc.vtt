In answering how many people we actually need to poll, we made an assumption.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And the assumption more or less is that small changes in p don't matter.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So we don't have to worry about getting it exactly right if we're trying to estimate a sample size.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
To prove this to ourselves, let's redo this calculation with p = 0.5 and p = 0.6.

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
