We know Rohan traveled 20 miles per hour faster than Janet. We don't know

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:07.818
Janet's speed, since it's just x, but we do know that Rohan would be 20 more

00:00:07.818 --> 00:00:14.548
than this. So Rohan's speed must be x plus 20. We simply just add on our 20 to

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:16.710
x, which is Janet's speed.
