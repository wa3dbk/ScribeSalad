00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.415
When I start at some value a, and then it goes up to b including b, with a less

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:15.480
than or equal sign here. Then there are b minus a plus 1 values. That plus 1 is

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.254
a fence post, plus 1. For example, over here, we start at 10, we go to 20, and

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:30.500
we have 20 minus 10 plus 1. That's 11 values. What about the case? When i

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.746
starts at some point and then it goes less to another point, in that case we

00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:44.093
have b minus a values. For example, if over here we change the less equal to a

00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:53.576
less than sign. Then we have 20 minus 10, or 10 values. Namely the values, 10,

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:58.545
11, up to 19. That's a very common situation that you've seen before. Let me

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:03.420
remind you, the situation where you, you have a less than for the upper bound.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.673
Is actually very common and you've seen it several times before. For example,

00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:10.615
now look at your left. There is the program that looks at all of the letters in

00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:14.480
a string. And when you look at the bounds you again notice a less than sign

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.302
here. We go less than and the length of the word. So when we look at our

00:01:19.302 --> 00:01:25.589
formula over here. In this case, a is 0, and b is word.length. So how many

00:01:25.589 --> 00:01:31.446
iterations do we have? We have word.length minus 0 iterations. And that makes

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:36.097
perfect sense. Because we have one iteration for every letter in the word. And

00:01:36.097 --> 00:01:39.559
word.length is the number of letters in the word.
