00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.536
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So that means then, that we might have two ways to get an answer of 0 over

00:00:04.536 --> 00:00:09.505
here. Either a could be 0 or b could be 0 or in some cases both, if a equals b.

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:13.966
Now that we know that either a or b or both need to equal 0 if we have an

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:19.069
equation of the form a times b equals 0, that means that to make this equation

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:23.926
true, we either need to have x minus 4 or x minus 28 equaling 0. So then what

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:28.469
two equations can we get out of this one equation that will each give us a

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:33.556
solution to this equation. I know this is kind of a tricky, subtle question, but

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:38.627
think back to what we learned about the ab equals 0 equation to figure this out.

00:00:38.627 --> 00:00:42.594
We should end up with two expressions, each set equal to 0.
