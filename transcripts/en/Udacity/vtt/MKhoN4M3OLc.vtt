00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.599
So it turns out that, unfortunately, this is no useful approximation factor at all.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.266
And the reason for that is that the approximation factor depends on the size of the minimum vertex cover

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:16.199
for the input graph. So the first thing to notice is, of course, that it's not a constant factor approximation algorithm,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.866
because we can be given any graph, and that graph can, of course, have different size vertex covers.

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:24.499
Let's say we wanted this to be at least a factor two approximation algorithm.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.232
What that would mean is that one plus K over N minus 2k is smaller than or equal to two.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:36.332
So when you solve this, what you get is that K must be smaller than or equal to N thirds.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.432
Now, seeing this, you might be inclined to think, "Why isn't this answer here correct?"

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:45.232
Because if K, which is the size of the smallest vertex cover, is less than or equal to n thirds,

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:52.466
then most of the vertices are in an independent set, so the answer could be, if the independent set is very large,

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:58.799
then we also have a good approximation algorithm. But the problem of that is, of course, that in order to really

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.899
assess the quality of the approximation, you need to have an exact solution. And if you already have an exact solution,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.699
then approximation, of course, makes no sense anymore. So it's an approximation factor that can only be determined

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.866
in hindsight once you have calculated an optimum solution, in which case you don't need the approximation anymore.

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:22.667
So this here is also not a correct answer, and the unfortunate thing is it's actually not a useful approximation at all.
