00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.190
So when your users access your web apps
they don't type in your IP address.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.010
They put in a name like www.example.net,
a web address with a hostname in it.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.250
The way that your hostname gets
translated into an IP address

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.450
is through the Domain Name System,
or DNS.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.110
DNS is a worldwide distributed
directory of network information.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.070
It stores a wide variety of records but

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.990
the best known kind of DNS
record is the A record.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.830
A for address, which maps a name like
www.example.net to an IPv4 address.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.570
Client programs such as web browsers
look up these records in order to find

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.240
the address of a web site or
another service.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.060
As the creator of a website you
need to set up DNS records for

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.780
it so that users can access it by name.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.090
Usually that will involve registering
the domain with a registrar and

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.700
pointing the DNS records at
the web servers IP addresses so

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.930
that users will be able to reach them.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.400
A little later in this lesson you'll
have a chance to do exactly that.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.080
A DNS turns out to be really
important for websites.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.780
If your DNS goes down, your site
can't be reached by most users.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.720
A number of big sites
including Google and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.760
Microsoft have had embarrassing outages
caused by their DNS records expiring.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.230
DNS domains are also used as part
of the security mechanisms for

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.290
HTTP, including SSL encryption and
cookie privacy.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.600
The DNS client code which
is called the resolver,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.730
is built into every operating system.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.350
Programs such as NC or ping, or
web browsers can just use it.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.880
To test out DNS,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.090
we'll use a couple of handy shell
utilities called Host and Dig.
