00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer to that is a clear yes.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In studies of Firefox and Eclipse

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we found one specific feature of the code

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that dominated all others.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
These were the imports made by individual modules.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That is, the other modules that the module in question would interact with.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
More specifically, whatever a module imported

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
would determine its likelihood to have a defect.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In Firefox, for instance, if you're module included nsIPrivateDOMEvent.h

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and nsReadableutils.h--that is, used these specific APIs or interacted with these specific APIs,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
then you're code would be doomed.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Because 20 modules that also included these two files

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
l had at least one security issue.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Likewise, in Eclipse if you imported something that dealt with internal features

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
of the compiler, your code would be 4-5 times as error prone as code that only dealt

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
with a graphical user interface.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Why is that so?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Well, if you write import compiler internal, this means you're going to write some compiler code,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and compiler code is more error prone than user interface code,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in particular because if you worked with a user interface,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
most errors you make will be immediately visible to the human eye.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Whereas if you deal with compiler internals,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
it's a long path from a bug in the compiler to a bug in the actual compiled program,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which then, again, has to be executed in order to have the bug cause a failure.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
None of this cause needs to be discovered right away.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
All of these are reasons why this domain, namely the compiler,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is way more error prone than the user interface.
