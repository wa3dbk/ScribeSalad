00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.059
So the answer is over 3,000 years old. Humans

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.350
have been using networks like this since at least

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.750
as long as we can record. They might have

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.790
just been networks where people talk to each other, but

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.010
even networks where they were using technology to communicate,

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.349
in this way, go back at least 3,000 years.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.870
So to give you an idea of how sophisticated

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.280
networks could be over 3,000 years ago, here's a quote

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.260
from Homer's The Iliad, where he's talking about the network

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.890
the ancient Greeks had. And they had a line of

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.870
beacons spread over the Greek islands. They could use that

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.530
to send messages, to warn the neighboring islands when there

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.350
was an enemy attacking, and that would tell them to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.470
bring in their ships, that trouble's about to occur. And

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.530
Homer was writing this around 800 BC. But what he

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.560
was describing are wars that happened over 3,000 years ago.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.100
And Homer wasn't just making this up. The Greeks actually had

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.970
such a network. They had a network where soldiers could light a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.480
fire on one island and soldiers on another island would see

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.980
that fire. Light their own fire that would send a signal to

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.870
the next island. The next island would see that and light

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.960
its own fire. And they could send messages over great distances this

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.400
way. They could send a message over 600 kilometers across the Greek

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.260
islands. So what do you need to make a network like this?
