Next, we have disorganized speech, which is sometimes called word salad,

00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:09.184
because of the way the words are arranged. Meaning that the speech of a person

00:00:09.184 --> 00:00:12.824
with schizophrenia often involves grammatical rules, but the content makes

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:17.963
little sense. Therefore, it's difficult or hard to understand what the person

00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:24.613
is saying. Their sentences make little sense. Also, topics of conversations can

00:00:24.613 --> 00:00:29.528
change with little or no connection between the sentences. And finally, speech

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:34.226
may be completely incomprehensible. Let's give an example of what we mean by

00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:39.295
disorganized speech, or as we said, some people refer to as word salad. In the

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:43.455
following example, a woman who believes she was the only female professor at

00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:47.810
the University of Smithsonian, in England, now mind you, there's no such place,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.637
uses words to produce a word salad. So let's try to go through this. Take a

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:57.420
moment and see if you can read it out loud clearly.
