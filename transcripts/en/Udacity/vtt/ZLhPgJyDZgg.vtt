00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.840
Let's take a quick look at how we would use

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.750
Device Motion to implement another common mechanism, the shape to send

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.630
feedback feature. Detecting a shape is actually pretty easy, we

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.930
just register an event listener for device motion and inside are

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.090
event handler. We calculate the squares of all of the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.660
accelarations in all three directions And then test to see how

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.840
big that absolute sum is. If we get a large value

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.350
here, we know we've hit a shake, so we can demonstrate

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.400
that on the screen. If we wanted to be fancy, we might want to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.130
sum these values over an interval of time, so slower motion that goes on

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.010
for longer would still trigger it, or we might want to add rotation into

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.200
the sum. But in practice this will work pretty well. Let's take a look.
