The best and fastest way is to find a mathematical relationship between the

00:00:04.117 --> 00:00:08.320
number of days that have passed and the total number of wipers said that I've

00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:12.150
been made. Completing the table would work, but it would be pretty time

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:16.485
consuming. Estimating is often a good way to begin thinking about a problem, but

00:00:16.497 --> 00:00:20.483
it doesn't give exact answers. We want to get information to Grant quickly but

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:23.495
we also want to be really accurate about. it.
