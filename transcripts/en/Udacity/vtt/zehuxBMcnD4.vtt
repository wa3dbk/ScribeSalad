00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.120
Now our goal is to send a text message using code, and I know of a Python

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.530
package that does exactly that. It's called twilio.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.570
And I am going to place twilio on the board.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.050
Twilio does not come with the Python Standard Library,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.060
which is why I have kept it outside of

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.180
the yellow background. Twilio is one of the thousands

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.840
of external Python packages that are available for you

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.910
to download and use, and there is a link

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.850
in the instructor notes that points out some of

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.300
the more popular external Python packages. For now what

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.260
we are going to do, is being by downloading twilio.
