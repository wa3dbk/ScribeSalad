00:00:00.205 --> 00:00:03.890
Let's just look at this code
execution that we're talking about.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.598
If the attacker actually guesses
our correct password, and

00:00:07.598 --> 00:00:11.463
types that as input to the program,
login is going to be allowed.

00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:15.028
What they're saying here is
the attacker doesn't have to do that,

00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:18.470
doesn't have to guess the password,
the correct password.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.830
So it's guessing some password,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.160
might takes trying different
types of passwords and so on.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.846
It gives a BadPassWd and
we don't have an all flow.

00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:32.427
Because the BadPassWd here, if you look
at it, it's still three, four, seven,

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:35.187
nine, ten characters long
terminated by a null.

00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:38.369
We still are good,
because we don't have an overflow.

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:42.024
And when we don't have an overflow, this
actually fits into the space we have for

00:00:42.024 --> 00:00:43.060
the password string.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.000
So, no overflow, and
it doesn't match, so

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.500
as a result the request
is going to be rejected.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.970
So this is sort of the things you do.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.680
You either find a password,
then you have access.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.350
You can become that user and
do what that user is allowed to do.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.169
Or you can try a password,

00:00:59.169 --> 00:01:03.990
but you're not going to be successful
by just trying any password.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.845
The chances are,

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:09.960
the password you type Is going to be, is
not going to match the user's password.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.730
And match fails, login fails
