00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.710
There's a number of different ways people use the word scope and

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.150
first, I want to explore the simplest of them.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.350
The first use of the word scope is lexical scope.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.590
This usage of the word describes the regions in your source code,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.960
where you can refer to a variable by name without getting access errors.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.760
The specific rules for this version of scoping can be

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.650
understood even without running your code, since it only concerns the area of

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.080
your code where different variable names will have meaning.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.600
Imagine this file held the source code for a very simple program.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.159
In simple programs with no functions at all,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.700
there is exactly one scope which is called the global scope.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.390
Every variable in such a program would be stored there.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.700
We represent the global scope in these slides using the color green.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.410
Now in some JavaScript environments, global scope is shared across different

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.380
files as a way for any part of the program to interact with any other part.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.540
If we add a variable to the program,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.140
that variable is to be said to be within the global scope and

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.070
thus it could be accessed from anywhere else in your whole program.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.790
Now we want this program to help us generate stories that

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.660
are all about the same hero.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.459
So let's put this hero variable into the global scope where every other line of

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.610
code can reference it.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.350
Also for the sake of this example, we should pretend that there exists

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.140
a function called aHero and that function returns a randomly generated name.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.120
We won't be investigating the source code or

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.910
the run behavior of that function during this talk.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.640
After defining a variable in a lexical scope, you may make reference to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.650
that variable from anywhere else in that lexical scope.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.590
Global variables are the easiest,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800
since there's nowhere in your code that you couldn't access them
