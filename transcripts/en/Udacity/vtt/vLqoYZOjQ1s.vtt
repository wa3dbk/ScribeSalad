00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.150
Okay, let's begin writing code. Now, the first thing

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.110
I've done is created a new file called send_text.py. And

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.240
as you can see, this file is empty for now.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.040
Then, if you go to Twilio's installation page, oh by

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.430
the way, this link is also available on the

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.340
instructor notes. If you scroll down on this page, you

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.110
will notice that Twilio has provided some sample code that

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.580
allows us to send text messages to our phone. Now,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.850
I just want to run and see if this code

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.530
even works. If this program does work only then will

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.080
I try and understand how it actually sends a text

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.530
message to our phone. So, for now, all I'm going to do

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.820
is copy this code and go back to my syntax

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.360
program and paste that code. Okay, so it seems that

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.420
the code is importing Twilio. Although it is a little

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.770
different then what we have seen thus far, there is this

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.230
keyword here called from which we haven't seen

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.208
before, I will return to this later. Okay,

00:00:56.208 --> 00:01:01.130
if you read the next two lines in the program they talk about account sid and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.140
authorization token. Now, these must be for Twilio

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.810
to figure out who I am. Almost like

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.390
my username and password. So, let's go to

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.020
the Twilio website and figure out these two values.
