00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.680
Sumat, what type of advice could you give students who

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.300
are looking to integrate maps into their data visualizations?

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.680
&gt;&gt; So I think maps are a different and difficult category of data to show.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.240
But they can also re, be really powerful.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.600
So I think, like with many other graph types,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.600
one of the most important things about when you're making a map is,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.030
to decide in advance what you'd like your audience to know.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.080
And to decide how you're going to show that.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.890
so, that involves things like, you know,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.130
deciding what scales you're going to be showing.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.800
You know, what the variation is.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.030
Making sure that you have a clear outcome, for

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.090
the people who are going to be looking at it.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.520
So, I think a lot of times when you're making any graph,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.980
it's really useful to think in advance.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.400
What's it, what's the main thing that I want people to take away, because as

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.670
a data scientist, it would be your job to tell people what they need to know.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.560
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.370
&gt;&gt; And so, often times it can be useful to do something like, even just like

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.410
titling, or using on of the axis labels to say, what the main takeaway point is.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.590
And using an annotation to point out what a particular event or an outlier was.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.908
So we have a couple examples up here that we can show.

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:18.621
So this one is a, a contour map that's on top of a scatter chart.

00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:26.458
That shows temperature anomalies in July with respect to 1981 to 2010.

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:30.694
And so it let's us see variations between temperatures in very cool and

00:01:30.694 --> 00:01:32.180
meaningful ways.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.210
And you can see it scaled from over here, to show differences in temperature.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.620
We also here have a bubble chart that let's you look at,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.080
different sizes of Canadian cities and the population that lives in them.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.740
And so this is a fun one because it let's us just kind of like visually get

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.823
a sense for, the overall population of Canada.

00:01:53.823 --> 00:01:58.190
&gt;&gt; Hm. &gt;&gt; Which you can see is just heavily centered around the border here.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.570
And then also where the most populated cities are.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.100
For making these maps folks have used the maps package.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.913
Or a maps library, n r, and then use Basemap from Python.

00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:11.260
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.400
&gt;&gt; For making maps if you would like a GUI Tableau and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.410
Data Wrapper both have really good tools.
