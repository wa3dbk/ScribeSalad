00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.620
Let's look at the solution to
our address translation quiz.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.880
We have a 16 bit virtual address
space and a four entry page table,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.910
that means that the most significant two
bits of the 16 bit address are the page

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.630
number, the remaining 14 bits
are going to be the page offset.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.450
So this 16 bit address can be
written like this in binary.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.440
F0F0.
The most significant two bits are really

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.300
the page number, which corresponds
to this entry in the page table,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.360
because this is three, so we need to
look at this entry in the page table.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.180
In this particular address we have 001F.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.750
These two bits correspond to
this entry in the page table.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.280
So now we can write out the physical

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.090
address that corresponds
to this virtual address.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.040
It is going to contain
the frame number from

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.730
entry number three in the page table.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.130
Which is going to be 1 7.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:08.040
Concatenated with the page offset
which is going to be 1 1 etc.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.742
And we can know write it
out it's going to be 0F0F0.

00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:19.387
And then we have F and this is five.

00:01:19.387 --> 00:01:24.290
It's a 20 bit address so
it will have five hex digits.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.280
Similarly here we are looking
at entry number zero here, so

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.310
it's going to be 1F,
followed by the page offset.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.785
So it's going to have 00 and

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:42.988
then the remaining digits
are going to be the same.

00:01:42.988 --> 00:01:48.350
So it's going to have F10 and then C7.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.110
C because it's 1100 and
7 because it's 0111.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.130
So this is the physical address for
this particular virtual address.
