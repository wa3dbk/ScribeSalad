00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.896
Now finally let's fill in this table. For each quantity up here please testify

00:00:04.896 --> 00:00:09.760
you at either in the interval in the left or the value itself if its inequality

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.548
and then stay in each box whether the quantity is positive, negative or zero

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:19.692
when that x value is put in. One other note, in this far right column if any of

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:25.068
the values over here makes the denominator equal to 0, then I want you to write

00:00:25.068 --> 00:00:28.034
the word undefined in that box over here.
