00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.550
Let's suppose that AS200 originates a prefix and that the path that result from

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.110
the original BGP routing are shown in

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.610
green. Let's now suppose that AS100 seeks to

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.650
become a man in the middle. If the original prefix being advertised was P, AS

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.970
100 could also advertise the prefix P, but we want to make sure that AS

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.230
100 maintains a path back to AS 200. Now that path already exists,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.410
it's right here. So what we want to do is make sure that neither AS 10

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.200
nor as 20 except this hijacked route. The way that we can do

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.288
that is through a technique called as-path poisoning.

00:00:46.288 --> 00:00:51.960
So, if AS 100 advertises a route that includes

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.060
AS 10 and AS 20 Both of these AS's will drop the announcement because they will

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.660
think they've already heard the announcement and don't

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.700
want to form a loop. On the other hand,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:10.840
the other AS's on the internet, in other words, every other AS that's not on the

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.760
path back from 100 to 200 will switch and now all of the traffic from other AS's

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.170
enroute to AS 200 will traverse the attacker AS100. Now

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.760
a trace route might look awfully funny taking this circuitous route, but

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.320
actually the attacker can hide its presence even if the sender is running a

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.680
trace route. Recall that a trace route simply consists of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.220
ICMP time exceeded messages. That result when a particular packet

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.900
reaches a TTL of 0. Now typically each

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.500
router along a path will decrement the TTL at

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.180
each hop. But if the routers in the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.730
attacker's network never decrement the TTL, then no time

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.920
exceeded messages would be generated by routers in

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.320
AS 100. Therefore the traceroute would never show AS

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.920
100 on the path at all. So now that

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.580
we've talked about the importance of origin authentication and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.100
attacks against it, let's talk a little bit about session authentication.
