00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.680
In this video, we are going to learn how to select between different models.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.480
Before we do that, let's do a quick recap from where we left off.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.310
With selected features using distances sampled over time,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.980
we investigated how many features we should select.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.380
We made sure we had enough data for the chosen features.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.600
We used the frequency of the data, to validate that we have enough data.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.320
We also wanted to make sure the data is good enough to distinguish patterns.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.240
We did this by visually inspecting the scatter plots and

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.490
making sure that our chosen features will have a discriminating power.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.780
We have discussed how best to choose our features and

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.855
how that can affect the final validity of our models,

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:51.760
through analysis of errors and model complexity.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.410
Once we have a good idea of the features set and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.980
a clear definition of the problem statement, we can build many different

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.470
types of model to identify different cars from our connected cars dataset.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.760
We are now ready to make the statement of the model.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.290
We want to use classification model to distinguish between B and F.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.310
We can do so by using several different classifiers.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.560
In this case, we have chosen three.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.630
A LOGISTIC REGRESSION, a SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE based classifier, and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.190
a RANDOM FOREST based classifiers.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.110
Each of these learning algorithms are a topic unto itself.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.280
And we will not attempt to cover the basics of these, assuming you have used or

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.130
seen most of these topics in the machine learning course.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.530
If you would like to have a refresher,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.840
please look at the material in the instructor's notes.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.850
After we build the three models, we will look at ways to measure

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.150
the performance of each model and then be able to make a choice between models.
