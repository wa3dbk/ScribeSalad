00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.750
Here’s an example.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.810
If your client code is making use of the GUI toolkit component that allows the n

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.540
users to type into a text box the client code can register the name of

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.930
a callback operation that should be invoked when the end user types into a,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.450
types into the field.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.020
During the period of this call the client callback operation has access not only

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.710
to the event itself, but the other elements of the component state,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.160
such as the type text, the specific text box, and

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.580
even the pixel position of the cursor on the screen.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.990
The client can take advantage of this information to do things like

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.600
suggest completions or fix spelling mistakes.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.320
Imagine further that while com-,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.520
computing possible work completions, the client makes a direct call to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.728
the GUI component asking it to display a message.

00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:48.100
When the callback code eventually returns control the component there is

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.170
no guarantee that the state of the text box is the same as it was before.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.800
It might not even be visible anymore.
