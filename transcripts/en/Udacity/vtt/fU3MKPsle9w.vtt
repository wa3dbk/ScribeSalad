00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.862
Before I implement the method, I'm going to write the tester. There are

00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:06.202
multiple ways you could do this, but there are also a lot of ways that look

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:11.576
similar and don't work. Here's the way I came up with. First, it checks to see

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:15.779
if the kitten is more than 6 months. If so, we know that we want to return

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:21.700
cute. Now, if the kitten is not more than 6 months, but is 2 or more months.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.121
Then the kitten is super cute. This condition is only checked if this condition

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:33.478
already failed. This whole piece of code is under the else clause for the first

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:39.102
if. Now if both of these conditions are false. Then we end up in the last else

00:00:39.102 --> 00:00:42.500
clause. This catches everything that doesn't satisfy one of the first two

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.027
conditions. So, if the kitten's not older than 6 months, and is not 2 months or

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:54.265
older. Then it's younger than two months, and so it's not cute yet. Let's check

00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:59.354
that this works. Okay, it looks like these match, they match, match, match and

00:00:59.354 --> 00:01:04.542
match. So, we're good. We could change this code slightly by adding another

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:09.702
condition here. The code will still work modified this way, but it's considered

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:14.716
bad form. If you decide to modify the 2 months threshold. You now have to

00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:18.665
change it in two places instead of just one. Also, if you don't understand the

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:22.819
condition right, or just make a little error, there could be cases that you

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:28.274
miss and don't handle at all. So, don't add an if condition here. That would be

00:01:28.274 --> 00:01:34.671
a bug. What if we changed the order of these checks? So, I take months greater

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:40.633
than 6 and put it here. Months greater than or equal to 2, here, and then,

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:50.040
change the return values to match. Do you think this still works? let's try it.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.423
It looks like it's wrong for the first case. These cases are okay and this one

00:01:54.423 --> 00:01:59.122
is, but it looks like there aren't any cute kittens anymore. Only super cute

00:01:59.122 --> 00:02:03.201
ones and not so cute ones. A kitten with eight months will do the first check

00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:07.044
and find that it's true and return super cute, without ever testing to see if

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:14.496
it's more than six months, as well. No matter what number months starts out as,

00:02:14.496 --> 00:02:20.974
this piece of code, here, will never run. That's a bug.
