Hi, my name is Jay and

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.110
I'm the course developer of
the Advanced Android Development and

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.000
Google services classes.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.220
I'm here to introduce
you to Project Zero.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.620
Project Zero is the first
project of your nanodegree.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.570
And while it's not required for

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.150
graduation, it's a really good way to
get started building apps right away.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.850
This project will be a central hub
from which you can launch the other

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.300
apps you'll be building.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.860
For now, each of these buttons will
just display a little message that says

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.660
something like, this button will
launch my media streamer app.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.260
As soon as you learn
about direct intents and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.690
developing Android apps, you'll be able
to launch the other apps you'll build as

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.980
part of your Nanodegree
from these buttons.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.530
Whenever you finish another project,
you can come here to update this hub,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.040
keeping your whole Nanodegree
portfolio within easy reach.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.900
To make this app you'll need to
complete five steps laid out in

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.436
detail in the next node.

00:00:45.436 --> 00:00:49.880
You'll install Android Studio, create
new project, customize your layout,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.360
tie each button to code, and
launch a message from each button.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.930
With that,
you'll have built your very first app.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.610
Welcome again, to the Android
Developer Nanodegree, and good luck.
