00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.950
&gt;&gt; Okay Michael, you go an answer for me? This isn't meant to be a hard quiz.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.340
&gt;&gt; Oh good. Cause I actually have two answers for you.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.640
&gt;&gt; Oh, I like that.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.200
&gt;&gt; So I would say right, right, up, up, right.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, right, right, up, up, right.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.790
&gt;&gt; But I feel like I could have also said up, up, right, right, right.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.510
&gt;&gt; And you could have. Both of those are acceptable. right, right

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.420
does what you think it does. You move right and then right and

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.560
then up and then up and then right. And

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.040
that takes five steps. Or you could have gone

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.270
up, up, right, right, right, which would also have

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.430
taken you five steps. So that's pretty easy, right?

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I thought so.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.570
&gt;&gt; Rag. So yes, either of these would be correct. We're going to

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.510
stick with this one in particular, since they're equal, because we gotta pick

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.420
one of them. So this does point out something that often in

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.830
a decision problem like this, there are in fact multiple answers or multiple

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.020
optima, if I can tie it back

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.490
to our randomized optimization discussions. Okay, so you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.860
got the quiz, you got the world, you understand what you can do here. Yes?

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.210
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.700
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Now I'm going to throw in a little wrinkle.
