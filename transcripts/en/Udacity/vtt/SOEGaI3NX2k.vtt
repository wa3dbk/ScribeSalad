00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.360
In this problem we've been tasked with finding a bug. Sounds

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.250
pretty straightforward, and we've done this before, but this time we're

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.790
mixing it up a bit, and not giving you access to

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.170
the source code. We didn't really give you too much guidance

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.300
on how to do this, but, believe it or not, this

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.340
is actually a pretty common thing you're going to have to do

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.980
in the real world. Having access to the source code, or

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.210
the implementation itself, is often more rare than it is common.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.120
Plus, sometimes even with the source code, it can be so

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.580
unfamiliar or poorly documented that it's, might as well not be having

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.680
it all. With that said, let's look at the problem. So

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.440
here we have the code to test the problem and below we

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.830
have the give and test case. Now e told you somewhere

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.100
in here lies the bug. One way to narrow it down, was

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.640
to look at each of these hypotheses and then test them

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.250
one by one. I'm going to show you a quick test case that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.520
gets right to the bug. Here, I've inserted the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.050
code from homework six, debugging environments and when I

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.180
run that code, I see the same bug that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.650
we saw in homework six. This implies, and you

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.390
can further verify on your own, the problem is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.970
right here, where we're not passing in the right

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.690
function environment when we're executing a function. So, bug

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.260
equals seven is the answer and just in case you're

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.480
curious, here's the source code for the expression evaluation, and

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.740
if we look at call, we'll see that the environment that

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.400
we call the function on is the same environment from

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.760
which its called and not from which the function was defined.
