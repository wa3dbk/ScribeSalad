00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.807
If I look at my Twitterizer Tester, I now have a test for reversing, how did I

00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:09.414
ever program without loops? Inside the twitterizer class, I have to implement

00:00:09.414 --> 00:00:13.906
the reverse method. I want to look at every letter in the string post, but I

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:18.822
want to start from the end, and work my way backwards. As I did last time, I'll

00:00:18.822 --> 00:00:21.702
start with an empty string backwards, that I'm going to add letters to, as I

00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:28.350
see new letters. But this time I'll start I at the last letter in post. And go

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.980
as long as i is not less than 0. I mean, as long as i, is not less than 0.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.638
Decrimenting i by 1 each time. Inside the loop, I want to record every single

00:00:40.638 --> 00:00:45.610
letter I see into backwards, and then I want to return backwards. When I run

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.749
the program, it didn't break the first one, and now reverse works, as well.
