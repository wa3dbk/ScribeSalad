00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Another form of oracle comes in the form of enhanced execution environments.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I've already used the example several times,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but in C or C++ we could run the compiled program under a runtime monitor like Valgrind

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which provides an enhanced execution environment which checks a lot of rules

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that aren't checked by the regular C and C++ runtime or by the operating system.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So for example, Valgrind will terminate our process

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
if we access beyond the end of an array,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and in practice, that's an extremely effective form of oracle.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If that kind of a rule violation happens during random testing,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
we absolutely want to know about it, and Valgrind provides that service.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Another example of an enhanced execution environment

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
would be one that checks for, for example, integer overflow of problems

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
or floating point problems.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So a medium oracle is going to vary in its degree of checking power

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
between the weak oracles we've already said

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and the strong oracles that I'll talk about in a few minutes.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And so far in my list, and I could be missing something,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but so far I only have one example of a medium power oracle,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and this is assertion checks that the programmer has put into the software.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The reason I call this a medium power oracle

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is it provides quite a lot more application-specific

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
kind of checking than do these weak oracles.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But on the other hand, it doesn't guarantee anything

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
even remotely close to actual correct operation,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and that's generally what the strong oracles are going to do.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So let's look at those.
