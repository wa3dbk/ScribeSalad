00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.916
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; These two number lines on the left show the inequality x is greater than or

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:07.635
equal to negative 2. And the two on the right are the ones that show x is

00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:11.904
greater than negative 2. Remember what we said very early on the lesson, that if

00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:16.000
a number is shaded, it's included in the range of numbers that are acceptable

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.211
for the solution. X is greater than or equal to 2, says that x can be greater

00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:24.201
than 2, but it can also equal 2. So 2 needs to be included in this range of

00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:28.525
numbers, which is why this circle is shaded in. When we have x is greater than

00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:32.877
negative 2, x is not allowed to equal negative 2, so the circle is not shaded on

00:00:32.877 --> 00:00:37.170
the point negative 2. The rounded parentheses is supposed to show that all of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.658
the values greater than negative 2, including everything just up until negative

00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:46.252
2, are included, but negative 2 itself is not. Intuitively, we can think of the

00:00:46.252 --> 00:00:50.452
square bracket as including the negative 2, because it's telling us exactly

00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:55.190
where this range of values cuts off, precisely at, but including negative 2. So

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.870
keep in mind for the future which kind of bracket shows inclusion and which one

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.459
does not.
