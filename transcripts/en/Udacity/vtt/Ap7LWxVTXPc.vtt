00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.390
There are various types of
ad formats that game and

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.117
app developers can put into their apps.

00:00:06.117 --> 00:00:11.120
The first and
most familiar to people are banners.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.930
And probably the newest that
you'll see used are video ads.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.600
There's different reasons you
might want to choose each.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.110
Of course,
it depends on the type of app,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.010
but there are also some other factors.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.820
What's the location of
most of your users?

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.180
Do you have an in game economy if you're
trying to offer rewarded, videos for

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.740
instance?

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.350
You have to take those into accounts.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.740
Understanding the payouts is a really
important part of understanding your

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.870
game monetization strategy.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.810
So ads pay according to
how the advertiser bids.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.220
These completely range.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.590
Understanding all of these
is important because

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.830
they're going to determine when
you're looking at your analytics.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.550
Why you are or are not getting paid?

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.900
And then you can optimize the ads, so

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.280
that it's a greater likelihood
somebody's going to engage with them.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.269
If it's a cost for per completed view
and your doing a rewarded video ad then

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.440
maybe you want to show your video ads
right at the point where somebody needs

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.590
whatever say your offering
them extra life in your game.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.390
Well you want to show that video
ad right where somebody needs it.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.700
So that they're more likely
to complete the view,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.960
so you're more likely to get paid.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.970
If you're say, monetizing from cost
per install ads then you probably

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.210
don't want to bombard your users with
interstitials pop up ads because

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.710
they're going to see them, accidentally
click on them and then never install.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.955
The ad networks themselves are going to
be optimizing based on the performance

00:01:41.955 --> 00:01:44.800
of the ads within your app or game.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.200
So if they see something that looks odd
or has a really low conversion rate,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.860
you're less likely to get ads served or

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.350
even high quality ads
served to your app or game.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.970
So it's really important to keep
an eye on those analytics and

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.650
then work with whoever
the providers are,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.130
to make sure that you're
delivering the right results.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.910
Mainly when choosing an ad partner,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.680
it's important to choose ones that
offer features that you're looking for.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.480
These features might be cross promotion.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.330
So if you want to have the ad network do
double duty for you so that you can also

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.360
do things like promote in game items or
perhaps promote your next title.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.480
It's important to choose an ad network
that can satisfy those objectives.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.390
Another feature that some ad networks
have that people like to choose from

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.160
are things like transparency.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.340
Can I see all of the ads that have
been shown if I have a kid's game, for

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.250
instance?

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.990
I want to make sure that the ads that my
players are seeing are age appropriate.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.350
If I have a really sophisticated
back end that I'm working with,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.600
I might want to choose an ad network
that has APIs that I can work with.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.290
Perhaps I want to choose an ad
network that functions well with

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.400
other elements within my game.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.310
For instance, If I'm using something
like Unity to build my game,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.880
a development platform then I want to
choose ad networks that have plugins.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.390
If I'm using a mediator, I want to
choose ad networks that I can then

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.140
plug into that mediator and
that all work nicely together.
