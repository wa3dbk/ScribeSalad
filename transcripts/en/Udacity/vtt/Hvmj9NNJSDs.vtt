00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.070
We're now into version two of UML. Which has as a total 14 different kinds

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.970
of diagrams. We're going to go over those quickly here but in the course we're

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.430
not going to be using all of them. We're going to concentrate on just three or

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.110
four of them. And we'll have special lessons devoted to those but I wanted you

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.790
to at least be aware of the different kinds of diagrams that are there.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.110
That said, on a particular project, you're unlikely to use all the diagrams.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.180
You're going to use the ones appropriate to the particular project.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.810
In particular, determine what is the trickiest part of the project and

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.370
use the diagram that helps you best understand that tricky part.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.800
The two main categories of diagrams are structural and behavioral.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.370
Structural diagrams give you the pieces of the system that are always there and

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.290
the relationships among them. Behavioral diagrams on the other hand,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.220
are concerned with the executions of the system. And the particular diagram

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.620
may only convey one execution. That is, you may have to have multiple sequence

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.410
diagrams in order to get a good feel for all of the behaviors of the system
