In the context of this problem and these equations, finding out that Grant wants

00:00:05.378 --> 00:00:10.300
to buy 75 gallons of solution means that we want to set x equal to 75. Now

00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:15.666
usually, we just think about something that looks like this as assigning a value

00:00:15.678 --> 00:00:20.828
to a variable and that is true. But don't forget, this is an equation of a line.
