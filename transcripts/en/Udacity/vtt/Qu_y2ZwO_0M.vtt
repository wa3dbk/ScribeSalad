00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.600
We start with making a more
precise definition of an s-t cut.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.130
Saying that it is
a partition of the vertices

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.740
such that the source s is in A and
the sync t is in B.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.010
And B is defined to be the set
of vertices minus those in A.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.000
For example, in this network here,
the green nodes might be A and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.810
the orange ones B.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.990
Or we might have this cut here.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.830
The vertices within one side of the
partition don't have to be connected.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.820
Next, we observe that f is an s-t flow,
and (A, B) is an s-t cut.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.910
Then the value of the flow is equal to
the flow out of A minus the flow into A.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.740
Which in turn is equal to the flow
into B minus the flow out of B.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.008
In this example here, we have 1
plus 1 plus 5 plus 1 exiting A,

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:59.473
and 2 units entering over here,
for a total of 6.

00:00:59.473 --> 00:01:04.486
And similarly for this cut here,
we have 2 exiting here and

00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:09.916
2 exiting here, and 2 entering here,
again for a total of 6.

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:13.500
As you might imagine, the proof
comes from the conservation of flow.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.510
We start with a definition of flow,
and then add 0 in the form of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.790
the conservation equations for each
node in the A part of the partition.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.850
For every edge where both vertices
are in A, the terms simply cancel,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.930
because it'll pair once here,
and once here.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.270
So we're left with the value
of the flow as being the sum

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.290
of the flows over edges.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.830
Between A and B, minus the sum of
the flows over edges between B and A.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.610
But this is just the flow out
of A minus the flow into A,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.740
which of course,
is exactly what we wanted to prove.
