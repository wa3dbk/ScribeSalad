00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.886
In this spreadsheet, and then copy and paste the data into a new spreadsheet and

00:00:05.886 --> 00:00:11.600
then try and find the average number of Facebook friends. Hm, okay, link to

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:19.428
Udacian's Facebook friends, equals, I can't type anything. Okay, oh copy and

00:00:19.428 --> 00:00:29.326
paste the data into your own spreadsheet. How do I do that? Now from Google

00:00:29.326 --> 00:00:40.630
drive, looks like I have to sign in, I can go to create spreadsheet. Let's call

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.750
this the same thing that says here, this way I can reference back to this in the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.214
future. Okay, so I have to Copy and Paste the data, edit, Copy's not there, I'm

00:00:53.214 --> 00:01:02.507
going to copy it by brute force. Force command C. Maybe I'll just try copying

00:01:02.507 --> 00:01:12.774
the data. Command c, command v, yay it worked. What's something else I could've

00:01:12.774 --> 00:01:20.456
done? File, maybe download as Microsoft Excel. Hey maybe this'll work. It did! I

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:26.922
have an exact copy of the data and I can do the exact same thing in Microsoft

00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:34.626
Excel. Well, I think I'll use Google Docs for now. Do-do-do-do-do. Oh no, I

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:39.984
accidentally clicked on it and it's gone, but here it is in my drive. From your

00:01:39.984 --> 00:01:45.462
Google account, you can see all the options here at the top. And here's my

00:01:45.462 --> 00:01:53.484
spreadsheet. Let's get to know this spreadsheet. This is cell A1, this is cell

00:01:53.484 --> 00:01:58.372
A2. Each cell has a name just like you and me, except we usually don't have

00:01:58.372 --> 00:02:03.328
numbers in our names. There's no comma or special characters in the name of the

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:07.754
cell, and it's always the letter first and then the number. What do you think

00:02:07.754 --> 00:02:14.357
this cell is? Let's put a header on this data so we know what it is. Insert row

00:02:14.357 --> 00:02:18.505
above. This is the header, and is not part of the data, it just tells us what

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:26.140
we're measuring. So that means, the data is from cell A2 to A28. Now I wonder

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.290
what cool stuff we could do with this data? How about data, sort, range. Oh,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.347
data has header row. I almost said data has header row. Sort by number of

00:02:35.347 --> 00:02:45.054
Facebook friends, indeed. What else could we do? What's this? That looks like

00:02:45.054 --> 00:02:50.062
sigma sum. Here's a bunch of functions, let's add them. It automatically put the

00:02:50.062 --> 00:02:54.748
formula here, we could've written that ourselves though and not been so lazy.

00:02:54.748 --> 00:03:01.612
Actually, let's do some formulas. Let's calculate the average. Equals. Average

00:03:01.612 --> 00:03:12.872
A2, because that's where our data starts, all the way to A28. Cool. And then we

00:03:12.872 --> 00:03:17.272
can see here, in the formula bar, what we just typed. Let's find the deviation

00:03:17.272 --> 00:03:21.816
from the mean. There's no formula for that, you just have to intuitively know

00:03:21.816 --> 00:03:27.008
what it is. Deviation, meaning how far something differs. From the mean, how far

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:32.037
each value differs from the mean. How do we find the difference? By subtracting.

00:03:32.037 --> 00:03:40.019
And how do we start our formulas? With an equals. A2 minus, and now we always

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:47.724
want this value to be constant. So instead of just writing E1, we're going to

00:03:47.724 --> 00:03:53.810
put a dollar sign in between the letter and the number. That'll keep it constant

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.424
when we copy and paste this for the other cells. So that makes sense, right? 0

00:04:00.424 --> 00:04:08.309
minus 584, blah-blah-blah should be negative 584, blah-blah-blah. So now, there

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:13.730
are a few things we can do. We can go to this corner here where there's a plus

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.261
sign, then drag it down, and then we get each deviation from the mean. In fact,

00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:29.561
if we click on it, we see in the formula bar this is A10 here minus the mean,

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:37.608
which is E1. Another thing we could do is click on this cell, push command c,

00:04:37.608 --> 00:04:45.544
or, if you're on a PC, Ctrl+C, go to cell A2, push command-down, go to cell B28,

00:04:45.544 --> 00:04:53.646
push command-shift-up. And then that area is highlighted. And then push command

00:04:53.646 --> 00:05:05.758
v. What's the sum of the deviations? Equals, sum B2:B28, it's like 0. It should

00:05:05.758 --> 00:05:12.901
always be about 0. Let's name this column, Deviations. Xi minus x-bar, and x-bar

00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:21.442
is the mean. Okay, let's do squared deviations. That's pretty self explanatory,

00:05:21.442 --> 00:05:29.455
it's just the deviation squared, equals B2 squared. Now again, command c, go to

00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:39.370
cell B2, command down. Go to cell C28, command shift-up, command v. I'm telling

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.788
you, if you get used to those keyboard shortcuts, you'll be able to do things

00:05:44.788 --> 00:05:50.950
way fast, especially if you have a list of 500 data values. It might be easier

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.390
for short data sets to just drag this down, but for large data sets, these

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.162
keyboard shortcuts will make your life a lot easier. So now we have our squared

00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:08.200
deviations. Let's find the sum of squares. Equals, sum, C2;C28. Error, I must

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:18.232
have typed something wrong. Let's look and see what I did. Oh, there's a comma

00:06:18.232 --> 00:06:27.679
right there, let's delete it. Now we get the sum of squares, or SS. Let's find

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:34.964
the variance. That's simply the sum of squares divided by n, equals C30 divided

00:06:34.964 --> 00:06:43.574
by, and it looks like there are 27 values. This goes until C28, but there's a

00:06:43.574 --> 00:06:52.345
header here. So it's not using one of the cells. So there are only 27 values.

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:58.358
Cool. So this is the variance. Should probably write this down, just so you

00:06:58.358 --> 00:07:03.954
remember. Oh, and look, it says all changes saved in drive. Every change you

00:07:03.954 --> 00:07:08.360
make is automatically saved in drive, that is so awesome. I love Google Docs.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.240
Notice that for variance, we divided by n, but if we were treating this as a

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:21.147
sample, we would divide by n minus 1. Okay, let's find the standard deviation,

00:07:21.147 --> 00:07:28.642
equals square root of C31. So here is the standard deviation. Which remember,

00:07:28.642 --> 00:07:33.754
it's represented by that Greek symbol Sigma. What if someone had a lot of

00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:39.373
Facebook friends? Like 100,000. How would that change our mean standard

00:07:39.373 --> 00:07:46.594
deviation and variant? Let's say that instead of having 408 Facebook friends, he

00:07:46.594 --> 00:07:54.237
has 100,000. Ready for this? Whoa! Everything changed automatically. The

00:07:54.237 --> 00:08:00.573
deviations are huge, because the mean is huge, and the square deviations are

00:08:00.573 --> 00:08:06.240
huge, and everything's huge. That's so cool. And then you don't have to do

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.872
anything different. What if everybody had zero Facebook friends? Then

00:08:10.872 --> 00:08:15.493
everything's just zero. Are spreadsheets totally awesome or what?
