00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.158
Let's look at them. So, the first one uses Raise with the string Try again. This

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:08.336
is not an exception. Though it won't raise that error, but it will raise an

00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:12.606
exception because this is invalid code. Any invalid code raises some kind of

00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:16.930
exception. And what this raises is a type error, which gets handled by this

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.690
handler, which raises a ZEroDivisionError with the string raise a ruckus, which

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.960
then gets handled by the outer try, by this handler, which prints out that

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.280
string. For the second one, well, this is an exception, so the Raise could work

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.798
with just that, but we're adding 3 to it. Exceptions don't have a plus

00:00:33.798 --> 00:00:37.510
operation, so that's going to produce a type error, which will get handled here.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.920
That's going to raise a ZeroDivisionError, which is also going to print Raise a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.248
ruckus. That's distinct from the third example, where we're going to print

00:00:45.248 --> 00:00:49.305
Raise. Now, we're going to call Raise with IO error, passing an a, so that's a

00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:53.041
valid raise. It's going to raise the IO error exception that's not a type error,

00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:57.213
so it won't be handled by this exception handler. But it is an exception, so

00:00:57.213 --> 00:01:02.442
it'll be handled by this one, which raises a type error, which is the value of

00:01:02.442 --> 00:01:07.950
the string associated with that exception, which is a and ruckus. And that gets

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.376
handled by this handler, which prints out a ruckus. And we already printed out

00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:16.867
the Raise here. So, this one also prints out Raise or ruckus. Part of what this

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:21.960
example illustrates is how convoluted exceptions can make your code. So, please,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.712
please, please don't ever actually write code like this unless you're trying to

00:01:25.712 --> 00:01:29.760
confuse someone. And usually, when you're writing code, you shouldn't be trying

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.723
to confuse people.
