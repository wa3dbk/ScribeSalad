00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.930
To Fork the recipes repository, first I'll visit Larry's repository on GitHub.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.730
You can find the link for this repository in the instructor’s notes.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.680
Now I'll zoom into this part of the page, and click the Fork button here.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.660
Then a copy of the repository is made on my own GitHub profile.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.080
Now, when I visit my profile, I can see the recipes repository here.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.250
Now I'd like to be able to edit these recipes on my own computer rather than

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.290
just on the GitHub website.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.930
So I'll also want to clone this fork.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.680
For recipes it doesn't matter so much where I edit, but if I were writing code I

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.840
would definitely want to be able to edit on my own computer.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.130
The GitHub page contains the URL I should clone over here, so

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.850
I'll copy that URL.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.820
And paste it into my git clone command.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.900
Now I'll cd into the new repository and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.090
you might think that I need to add the fork on GitHub as a remote so

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.500
that I'll be able to push to it but actually when you clone a repository Git

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.730
automatically sets up a remote pointing to the repository you cloned from.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.284
I'll verify that by running git remote -v.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.500
And, sure enough, there's a remote called origin.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.910
And the URL points to my repository on GitHub.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.160
Finally, since I want Sarah to be able to collaborate with me,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.150
she'll need permission to push to this repository.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.950
I'll add her as a collaborator by going to Setting, clicking Collaborator,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.620
and then adding her GitHub user name with the salogel42.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.570
You won't need to add Sarah as a collaborator to your repository, but

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.990
you can add anyone who you would like to be able to push to your repository.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.990
Then I'll need to click the Add Collaborator button.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.300
Now fork Larry’s repository to your own GitHub profile.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.200
Don't fork the one on my profile, since I'll be making changes to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.600
my fork throughout this lesson, and you don't want those changes.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.580
Again, you can find full link to Larry's repository in the instructor's notes.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.610
Once you've created the fork, clone your fork and run git remote -v and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.790
paste the output into this box.
