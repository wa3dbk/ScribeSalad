00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.900
The upshot of attacking and fixing the three sources of latency of concern for

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.470
real time task is that TS-Linux is able to provide quality of

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.079
service guarantees for real time applications

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.460
running on commodity operating systems such as

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.904
Linux. At the same time, by

00:00:20.904 --> 00:00:25.696
admission control, using the proportional period scheduling,

00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:31.140
TS-Linux ensures that throughput-oriented tasks are not

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.489
shut out from getting CPU time. The

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.920
proof of the pudding is in the eating. I encourage you to read the details

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.430
of performance evaluation carried out in this

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.230
paper that I've assigned to you for

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.150
reading, wherein the authors show that both

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.060
the above objectives are achieved by their design.
