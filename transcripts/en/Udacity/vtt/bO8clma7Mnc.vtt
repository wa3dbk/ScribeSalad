00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.400
Now, you might be wondering why we care about parts of speech.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.480
I thought this was a visualization course.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.530
Well, I would argue that parts of

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.290
speech are to sentences what visual encodings are to charts.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.860
Just as sentences are composed of parts of speech,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.050
which each contribute differently to the overall message of the sentence,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.700
charts are composed of different visual encodings,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.310
each of which most effectively convey a specific aspect of the underlying data.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.010
Wikipedia defines a chart as a graphical representation of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.479
data in which the data is represented by symbols.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.990
It then goes on to give examples, such as bars in a bar chart,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.330
lines in a line chart, or slices in a pie chart.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.230
I'll be using the word chart in this lesson in

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.010
a slightly more constrained manner to mean a common pattern or

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.310
convention for combining visual encodings or symbols.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.160
And while there might be an infinite number of ways you can

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.190
create a sentence through different parts of speech, in practice,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.720
there are a limited number of combinations that make sense, and

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.320
an even smaller number that people use in practice.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.790
Part of this is due to the constraints and rules of language and

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.730
grammar, but part of it comes from the fact that it's easier to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.130
understand patterns that are familiar.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.980
For example, you'll never see a sentence that has no verbs and only nouns.
