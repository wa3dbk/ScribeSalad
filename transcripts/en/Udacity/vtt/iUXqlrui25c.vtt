00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.522
So I think that many times when you ask
an entrepreneur, when an entrepreneur

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:10.235
asks me what investors should I pick up,
or how should I choose my investors?

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.582
The first answer I give
them is just like that,

00:00:13.582 --> 00:00:16.763
just like I expect you fast as possible.

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:18.924
You should expect your investors
to move the fast as possible.

00:00:18.924 --> 00:00:22.690
In between getting a great
investor in three months, or

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.830
getting a good investor now,
go for the good investor now.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.610
And then fulfill the rest of your needs
in terms of people that will help you

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.890
through advisors or anything else.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.460
I think that this is good advice
in general, because as I said,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.610
speed is the most important thing.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.520
If you don't have money,
you cannot move.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.530
In many cases,
you cannot hire more people.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.680
And so this is really critical.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.420
Having said that, you've gotta make
sure that you don't get investors in

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.290
that basically become
a liability on the company.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.150
And the kind of investors that could
become a liability on the company,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.420
are those that are either

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.420
very bad in the way they manage
the relationship with the founders.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.400
That's one thing.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.860
Or they will demand all kind of
terms that would basically take away

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.470
either the control of the destiny of
the company or slow down the company.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.120
And so, when I see investors that
are requiring extreme veto rights,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.720
or they're requiring to be
the ones approving stuff, or

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.010
investor I've even seen investor
that say I want to sign on

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.930
amounts of the company spends
above a certain level.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.300
I stay away from these and
the reason is because as I said I wanted

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.870
the entrepreneur to be able to move
fast and interact fast, and if each such

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.270
movement and iteration is going to be
slowed down by investors that want to be

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.030
part of it, then the company's going to
have a liability that I don't like.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.960
And so, all things equal,
go with good investors that move fast.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.270
However, make sure that you
do not take money from people

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.010
that could become a liability.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.130
How do you know that?

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.160
First of all, get a good lawyer.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.780
And a good lawyer is not necessarily
one of the large firms, but

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.870
it's somebody that deals
with many start ups.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.500
And make sure that the lawyer
explains to you what are the terms

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.260
that are in the contract that
are going to slow you down.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.280
And these are the ones
you need to insist on,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.350
on removing the ones that slow you down.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.580
The second thing, never take money from
an investor without talking to at least

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.830
one company, preferably more,
that they invested in.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.497
Just like the investor
due diligence is you,

00:02:17.497 --> 00:02:20.220
you need to due diligence
them because that's marriage.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.170
They are going to be together for
years now.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.280
And so, if you're not going to basically
talk to somebody that already worked

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.120
with them and get honest review of them,
then you're not doing yourself justice.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.220
And just like an investor
is not doing its job

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.800
if they're not doing due
diligence in the company,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.220
you're on the doing your job if you
not due diligence in the investors.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.800
And after all of that,

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.670
when you get the list of people
that passed your due diligence and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.770
that are willing to move fast, only then
start thinking about who's the best.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.350
Only then start thinking about
who can help me the most and

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.950
who can bring me the most value.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.810
And then, when you think about who can
bring me the most value, it's important

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.340
to not think about who brings me the
most value hands on, because you don't

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.820
want your investors to be hands on with
the business that you're building.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.730
It's two things, is who gives me
the most credibility in the market.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.180
Because let's say that you're building
an open table like business, and

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.230
if you've got an investor which is an
open table x executive that brings you

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.510
lots of credibility with investors.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.030
So, that's one thing
that can bring you value.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.436
The other thing is if you
get access to their network.

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:26.380
So, look at the network of the person.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.460
These are the two things to look for.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.310
Credibility that it gives you,
a network that you can use.
