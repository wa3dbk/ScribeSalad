00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.350
1 divided by x plus y is correct. Fantastic work if you figured that one out.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.646
You might not be sure what to cancel here. So let's look at one fraction, and

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:12.140
our factors multiplied together. First I'm going to expand this power of two.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.493
The quantity x plus y squared is really x plus y times x plus y. Now we just

00:00:18.493 --> 00:00:22.890
multiply our numerators across and our denominators across. I need to make sure

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.530
to put parentheses around this x plus y, since we would really be distributing

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.625
this 2x to each of the terms. We could see that here. But I don't actually want

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:34.885
to distribute or multiply the 2x to each term, since you want to be able to

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:39.778
cancel factors here and here. These factors reduce to 1, and we're left with a 1

00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:44.300
in the numerator and an x plus y in the denominator. You want to make sure that

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.340
you don't think the numerator is zero. These factors really reduce to 1, so we

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.200
have 1 times 1, which is 1. Some fractions will end up with a 1 in numerator,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.213
and others might have a 1 in the denominator. You'll want to watch out for that.
