00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's see how we came up with our answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Number 1, our pay-per-click number was 75 cents for each customer that we go to our side

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and we know we got 4,025 customers, and so if we multiply that out, we know we've spent $3,018.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And on the next number that's important is that not all 4,025 actually activated and in fact,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
if we look at this number, our conversion number, only 3.7% converted.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If we multiply that out, we'll discover that equals about 149 activated customers,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and now if we divide the $3,018 by these 149 activated customers,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we find out that the customer acquisition cost, the CAC, equals about $20,

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
more precisely about $20.27.
