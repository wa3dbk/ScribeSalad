00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.220
Next, we'll do a little exercise
to practice using multitape

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.630
Turing machines.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.640
Again, the point here is not so
that you can put

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.410
experienced programming multitape
Turing machines on your resume.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.410
That is to get you familiar
with the model, so

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.890
that you can really convince yourself of
the Church-Turing thesis, and understand

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.020
how Turing machines can interpret their
own description in a later lesson.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.697
With that in mind your task is to
build a two tape Turning machine that

00:00:25.697 --> 00:00:30.130
decides the language consisting
of strings of the form x hash y,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.344
where x and y are both binary
strings and x is a substring of y.

00:00:34.344 --> 00:00:42.695
So for example,
the string 101 is a substring of 01010.

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:45.430
There it is as a substring right there.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.070
But on the other hand,
001 is not a substring of this one.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.250
Sure there's a zero here,
a zero here, and a one here, but

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.630
they aren't consecutive, so
it doesn't count as a substring.
