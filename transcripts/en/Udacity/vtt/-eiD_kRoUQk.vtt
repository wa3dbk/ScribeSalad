00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.050
I mentioned, a minute ago,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.930
the association class. You can think of an association class as ac-,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.430
as an association that has some class properties. For example attributes, or

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.430
you can think of it as a class that has some association properties.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.280
Here's an example. If we have a company class. And a person class,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.870
and we have some kind of association between them that a person, has

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.550
a job with a company. We might want to indicate what that person's salary is,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.080
from that company. So this is not really a property of the person.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.610
Because the person might have more than one job is not really a property of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.320
the company because the company certainly has more than one person.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.070
It's really a property of the association itself.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.860
Association classes are indicated by having a dashed line.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.730
That abuts into the association line. At the end of the dash line is

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.910
another rectangle. In this case it is the association of class called job,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.210
and in the class rectangle for job there is an attribute of salary.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.470
Notice something else a little peculiar here. That job,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.550
has an association with itself. This is called a recursive association.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.200
For recursive associations in particular, you better use role names.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.200
This case, we're talking about the manages association. So

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.020
one job might manage another job. The department head might manage the staff and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.430
therefore we want to have roles for the boss or supervisor, and the worker.
