00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.022
To make a reflection in the Y axis happen, we simply need to replace x in our

00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:09.705
original function with negative x in the transformed function. So, here are the

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:14.468
four functions that Athena needs to make her final glasses frame logo. This is

00:00:14.468 --> 00:00:18.498
pretty cool. With a couple of domain restrictions and a few other functions

00:00:18.498 --> 00:00:22.916
added in, she could complete her picture like this. Or maybe she'd rather let

00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:27.086
the functions themselves complete the glasses. Of course, adding in a couple of

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:31.150
other lines and points for wipers and nozzles. Either way, I think we've seen

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.950
just how powerful transformation of different kinds of functions can be. You've

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.635
learned about shifts, horizontally and vertically, reflections in the X-axis

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:44.936
and the Y-axis, and stretches and shrinks in the vertical direction. These are

00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:48.817
all super powerful tools that can be used with any kind of function. Awesome

00:00:48.817 --> 00:00:51.879
job. I'm sure Grant will be very pleased with this logo.
