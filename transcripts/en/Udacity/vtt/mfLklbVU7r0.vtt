Hi and welcome to class.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.130
I'm here with Jonathan and Ryan of academy which is an immersive program for

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.360
students to learn all about data science.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.570
We're super excited to teach you guys about data visualization and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.880
we want to kick off this class with one simple question.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.880
So Jonathan, Ryan, what is data visualization?

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.270
&gt;&gt; Great question, Chris.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.250
To me data visualization is about conveying a story or

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.330
an idea as efficiently as possible.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.440
It's often said that a picture is worth 1,000 words and

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.470
I think data visualization works the same way.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.370
Data scientists used data visualisation every day to explore patterns in

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.550
their data and to ultimately convey their results.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.210
So we're super excited to share some of

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.240
what we teach our students with you today.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.700
&gt;&gt; Cool. And Jonathan, what about you?

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.391
What do you think about data visualization?

00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:48.936
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I think the title of Edward Tufte's classic book,

00:00:48.936 --> 00:00:52.899
The Visual Display of Quantitative Information actually get's at

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.630
a core of what many people think of as data visualization.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.690
Simply, how best to represent visually some underlying data using things

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.700
like color, size, shape to convey some information or

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.650
some insight to their audience and their reader.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.650
And I think it actually goes a little bit further than that

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.440
incorporating storytelling and narrative elements, like Ryan mentioned,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.080
to let the author of data visualization tell some interesting insight

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.140
they've discovered on their own and they want to share it with their audience.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.650
&gt;&gt; Interesting, thanks for sharing that guys.
