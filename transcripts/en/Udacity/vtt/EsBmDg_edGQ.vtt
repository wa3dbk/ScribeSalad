00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.650
In CSS, you first write what's called a selector.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.750
And this defines what elements of the page a particular style will apply to.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.660
You can select an HTML tag and that rule will apply to all tags on the page.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.950
And if, for example, you want to apply style to all paragraphs on a page,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.380
you can do so by writing the following.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.190
Another way to do so is to select elements by class.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.700
And this is what we did in our previous example.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.750
So, if we want to write a style that applies to the class description,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.260
we do so by typing dot description, and

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.050
inside brackets, you write the style in the form attribute colon value.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.330
So for example, we can say attribute color is value red.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.510
You can also combine selectors.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.660
So, for example,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.700
you can select all links that're inside an element with the class article.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.140
There are links to the instructor notes for more information on this.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.310
Now, earlier we said that red wasn't really the best color, but

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.800
what if we wanted to learn more about colors and how to define them?

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.610
Logically, we could say, instead of typing red,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.730
I might want to type blue or black, or any other color.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.600
But what if I want to get more specific?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.730
There's got to be a way to do that, right?

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.720
Of course, there is.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.870
I mean, CSS has a lot of functionality, and it's impossible and unnecessary to

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.430
go into every detail right now and memorize all possible attributes and values.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.450
I mean, you probably fell asleep at your computer, right now,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.160
and none of us want that.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.220
Instead, you should get comfortable referencing the CSS documentation.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.880
We've included a link in the instructor notes.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.180
In exploring the page,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.130
you'll see that there are a lot of attributes that you can use.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.520
For example, going back to our color reference, we can search for color.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.350
Scrolling through the documentation,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.700
you'll find examples of different ways you can define colors.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.980
You can find the color red we used before.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.889
You could also call rgb colors.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.880
Here you'll find the color red example we used earlier.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.870
You could also call hexadecimal colors or even rgb.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.690
Going back to the documentation,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.820
let's do a small exploration into font properties.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.170
Search on the page for the font-style attribute.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.590
Then answer the following question.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.520
Which of the following are possible values for the font-style property?

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.600
Is italic a possible value?

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.840
What about bold or normal?

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.730
Is that a possible value?

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.520
What about standard?

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.420
Also, which property would you use to make the text look bold?
