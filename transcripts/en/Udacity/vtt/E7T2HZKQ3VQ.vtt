00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.841
This vertical distance is about forty five and eight tenths of a centimeter.

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:08.886
Nice problem solving if you got this correct.

00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:13.020
We'll find this vertical leg by using 
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.032
We know the horizontal distance are one leg
of the triangle is twenty units.

00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:21.394
And we know the length of a string is fifty units.

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:23.932
Now our units are centimeters

00:00:23.932 --> 00:00:26.910
but I'm just leaving it out as we work 
through the problem.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.775
We want to make sure we add that back in

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:30.644
when we get to our answer.

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:32.677
So twenty squared equals four hundred

00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:36.547
and fifty squared equals two thousand five hundred.

00:00:36.547 --> 00:00:40.032
Then we'll subtract four hundred from both sides of our equation

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:43.674
to get b squared equals two thousand one hundred.

00:00:43.674 --> 00:00:46.135
We'll take the square root of both sides of the equation

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:47.888
indicating plus or minus.

00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:50.282
But we'll only use the positive root

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:52.561
in the sense that we have a distance.

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:56.970
In this case b is about forty five and eighty two hundredths

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.802
Round it to the nearest tenth

00:00:58.802 --> 00:01:01.722
we'll have forty five and eight tenths.

00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:03.505
We've been working in centimeters

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:07.144
so we'll report this answer in centimeters.
