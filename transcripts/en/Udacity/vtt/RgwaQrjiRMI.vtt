00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.349
Working together, they can paint the room in 12 7ths hours time. Great thinking

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:11.600
if you found this fraction. 12 7ths is equal to 1 hour and 5 7ths of an hour.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.813
If we do some conversion and convert this to minutes, it's about one hour and

00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:20.098
43 minutes. And here's the equation we want to set up. We know that Tim can

00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:25.065
paint the room in 4 hours time. So he can complete one job in 4 hours. The

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:28.475
other way of thinking about this is that he will complete 1 4th of the job in 1

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:34.428
hour. Vanessa's painted the room in 3 hours. Which means she can complete the

00:00:34.428 --> 00:00:39.658
full job in 3 hours time, job per hours. So, notice that we can think about

00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:44.452
this as a rate. We have Tim completing 1 job in 4 hours and Vanessa completing

00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:49.537
that same job in 3 hours. So if we add their two rates together, we would get

00:00:49.537 --> 00:00:54.298
them completing the job in x hours time, the time you want to find. And now

00:00:54.298 --> 00:00:57.642
here's the other way we were thinking about it. Tim can complete 1 4th of the

00:00:57.642 --> 00:01:03.156
job in 1 hours time. Vanessa can complete 1 3rd of the job in 1 hours time. So

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:08.354
together they can complete 1 over x of the job in 1 hour's time. We start

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:12.791
solving this equation by multiplying though by the LCD. The least common

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:19.590
denominator is 4 times 3 times x. Or 12 x. We multiply each fraction by this

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.438
number, and that gives us 3 x here, 4 x here, and 12 here. We add our like

00:01:26.438 --> 00:01:31.666
terms on the left to get 7 x equals 12. And finally we divide by 7 to get 1 x

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:36.574
is equal to 12 7ths. This is the amount of time it takes them to paint the room

00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:37.660
together.
