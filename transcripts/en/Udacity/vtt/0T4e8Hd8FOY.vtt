00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.930
Our goal is to create a model to understand a phenomenon.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.090
We cannot do this in isolation.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.690
Modeling must be done in tandem with forming and

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.100
reforming questions, and validating the model that we create.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.680
The process of model building in data analysis can be

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.050
thought of as occurring in three phases.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.730
Questioning, modeling, and validating.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.870
In the course of analysis we are constantly iterating back and

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.790
forth among these things in successive loops that build upon each other.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.330
So it turns out that the single most frequent call to AT&amp;T's helpline is,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.118
when will my UVerse technician arrive.

00:00:32.118 --> 00:00:35.680
And so AT&amp;T thought it would be valuable to create a model for

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.430
performing this prediction.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.910
So my modeling process began with a simple question.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.070
When will my service tech arrive?

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.090
Now in order to make this question answerable, it has to be made quantitative.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.610
And so we must choose a metric that captures this phenomenon
