[Norvig] One important principle of testing is to do extreme values.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So in some sense, this is kind of an extreme value.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We're testing 1 hand against itself.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But there are other types of extreme values.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What if the list of hands that's passed to poker has only 1 item

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
or 0 items or 100 items?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, poker is not usually played as solitaire,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so there wouldn't be much point in having 1,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but nothing in the specification rules it out.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So add a test that checks when 1 hand plays that that 1 hand is the winner.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What about 0 hands?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The specification doesn't say, but it does say that the function poker

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is supposed to return a hand.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And if we pass it a list with nothing in it, then there's no hand to return.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So I think the best thing to do is to make it clear that when we're passed 0 hands

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that that's going to be an error.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If you wanted to, you could return the value none.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That might be a reasonable thing to return.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But I think the best thing to do is just to say that that's an error.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We also want to have extreme values.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What if 100 people are playing poker at once,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
if hands is a list of 100 different hands?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We want to allow that too.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It would be unusual, and we'd need a big deck of cards with 500 cards, but it could be done.

00:01:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So I want you to write tests to check for 1 player and to check for 100 players.
