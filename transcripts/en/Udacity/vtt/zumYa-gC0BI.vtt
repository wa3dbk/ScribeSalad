00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.711
Here are a few common types of
market segmentation practices.

00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:08.141
Behavioral, psychographic, demographic,

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:14.270
geographic, occasional,
and cultural segmentation.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.220
Let's start by talking about behavioral
and psychographic segmentation.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.252
Behavioral segmentation
considers a few things,

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:23.585
such as the knowledge of your product.

00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:25.709
Their attitude towards your product.

00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:30.250
How or how often they use your product
or how they respond to your product.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.709
Their loyalty to your product.

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:36.675
And you can also think about creating a
segment based on what your customer will

00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:39.100
benefit from your product.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.810
Behavioral segmentation
is a great place to start

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.270
when you think about
segmenting your market.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.480
Let's take an energy bar, for example.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.543
What's important to you?

00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:49.500
Do you look at the price?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.220
Do you look at the calories?

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.450
Do you want something that has
less calories or more calories?

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.480
Do you look at the protein?

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.340
Or maybe you don't care,
and you're just hungry?

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.491
Our messaging for
each of these segments, so

00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:04.661
the people who are just hungry,
the people who want more protein or

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:07.335
less calories, or
the people who care about the price.

00:01:07.335 --> 00:01:08.959
The message is going to be different.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:11.662
And it's going to be affected by
the different benefits that these

00:01:11.662 --> 00:01:13.070
customers seek.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.600
We also need to think about the places,
online or

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.100
offline, where our customers may
find each of these segments.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.790
So, say it's offline.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.220
We may consider to put a poster in
a gym, marketing our energy bar.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.660
And online, we might want to add an add
to a page that sells workout clothes.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.590
Now let's talk about
psychographic segmentation.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.440
This segmentation is achieved by
studying activities, interests, and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.640
the opinions of your customers.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.292
You're thinking about
the lifestyle of your customer.

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:45.793
How do they spend their downtime?

00:01:45.793 --> 00:01:48.125
What are they influenced by?

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:50.445
What image are they trying to project?

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:54.815
What are the needs and wants of people
in this common lifestyle group?

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:58.580
For example, usually people who buy
a luxury car can not only afford it,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.390
thus defining their economic status, but

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.620
it also shows a preference to spend
money on more luxury lifestyle products.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.055
So we can extrapolate that they may
travel to high class destinations,

00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:14.646
wear specific brands, or
visit certain establishments.

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:18.786
So, say we're trying to sell a luxury
car, if we want to market to people who

00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:23.084
can afford it, we're going to consider
doing that in other high-end places.

00:02:23.084 --> 00:02:26.941
Such as a luxury magazine found in the
first class section of an airline, or

00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:30.020
sponsoring the valet outside
of an expensive restaurant.
