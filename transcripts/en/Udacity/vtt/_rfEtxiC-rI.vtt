00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.939
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Because functions are so unique and have an input and output, we have another

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:10.042
way of representing it. Instead of using y, we'll use something else. We'll use

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:14.809
f of x, or a function of x because the output relies on the input x. F of x is

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.397
the name of the function that represents the output. And x is our input

00:00:19.397 --> 00:00:24.540
variable. And this side of the equation describes how we change x. To find the

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.580
value or output of a function, we use substitution. For example, we could

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.826
evaluate this function for x equals 3. My input is 3, so I plug it in. I want to

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:39.967
find the output, or f of 3, by carrying out this math. So, here, the output,

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:45.101
when x is 3, is 7. When you see a statement like this, you really want to think

00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:50.214
of it in terms of the outputs and inputs. When the input x is equal to 3, the

00:00:50.214 --> 00:00:55.167
output of the function or the y value is 7. We don't have to evaluate our

00:00:55.167 --> 00:01:00.538
function for just numbers though. We could also use another expression. For

00:01:00.538 --> 00:01:05.908
example, if my input x was 3 x squared, I would plug it into my function. So,

00:01:05.908 --> 00:01:12.909
the output of 3 x squared would be 6 x squared plus 1. This would be the answer

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.057
containing a variable. Notice, it's not just a number.
