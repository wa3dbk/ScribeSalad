00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.450
So now that we're logged
in to our cloud shell,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.050
let's take a look at how we manage
applications without Docker.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.528
We'll kick this off by creating a Ubuntu
VM to play around using the gcloud

00:00:09.528 --> 00:00:11.280
compute instances create command.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.080
Once our VM is created, we"ll log in
using the gcloud compute ssh command.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.852
On our VM, let's use our native
package manager to install NGINX and

00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:24.090
all of its dependencies.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.560
First we'll have to make sure
everything is up to date on our system.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.090
Now, with our system up to date, we're
going to install the NGINX web server.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.470
And let's check the NGINX version.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.240
Let's use systemd to start the NGINX
based on what we did previously.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.640
Now I need to check that
the NGINX is actually running.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.600
One way to do that is with
the systemctl command.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.860
So I see that everything's
actually running.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.990
I see the logs are telling
me everything looks right.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.950
So now I should be able to hit
NGINX locally, using curl.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.853
This is great.

00:00:56.853 --> 00:01:00.999
So modern OSs make it really easy
to install applications, start, and

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:01.630
run them.
