00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.150
Bottomline is you can't design an complex system with having,

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.270
without having some idea of what it's supposed to do.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.720
That is what problems is it trying to solve. Diagrams can help you

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.120
express that understanding and express your solution to that problem.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.538
UML provides a wealth of diagram types for you as well as OCL and

00:00:22.538 --> 00:00:27.300
the meta model. In general, the more precisely you understand problem the fewer

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.290
subsequent problems you will have with that system's history.
