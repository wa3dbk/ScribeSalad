00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.340
So here are the eight types. First, we have linguistics. This is the language

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.192
and verbal side of intelligence. This is our ability to understand and use both

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:14.192
written and spoken language. Next we have our mathematical logical type of

00:00:14.192 --> 00:00:18.108
intelligence. This is the ability to analyse information and problems

00:00:18.108 --> 00:00:22.540
logically, and to perform mathematical operations. For Spatial Intelligence,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.660
this involves the ability to solve problems in three dimensional space. Next,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.346
our Musical Intelligence involves the ability to perform or compose music, or

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:37.301
to hear patterns and recognize them. Bodily kinesthetic Intelligence, this

00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:41.632
involves the capacity to use your whole body or parts of your body to solve

00:00:41.632 --> 00:00:47.660
problems, make something, or carry out a performance. Next, we have our

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.784
Intra-personal Intelligence. This is the ability to understand, yourself, know

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:55.032
who you are, what you want, and understand how you're going to react to

00:00:55.032 --> 00:01:00.602
different situations. Your Interpersonal Intelligence, this is your ability to

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:04.822
understand other people, what they're thinking, what they're feeling, or what

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:11.874
they're being motivated by. And finally, Naturalist Intelligence. This is

00:01:11.874 --> 00:01:15.600
having the ability to understand and discriminate different living things, such

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.240
as plants and animals. And being aware and sensitive to one's natural world.
