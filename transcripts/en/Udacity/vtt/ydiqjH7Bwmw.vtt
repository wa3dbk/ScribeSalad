Design is a collaborative process. And to promote

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.400
collaboration in this course, we've built a space where

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.000
you and your fellow classmates can meet, discuss

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.690
the course and share course deliverables for feedback. Let

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.630
me give you a tour. To access the forum, just click on the Forum icon or the

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.165
Start a Discussion button from any course page. The

00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:25.850
forum will open in a new tab. And you'll

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.900
see that it's organized by categories for each

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.080
lesson and the final project, in addition to

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.720
a few other categories. Categories consist of instructor

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.320
defined topics which you'll see are pinned to

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.830
the top of the list in addition to

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.730
topics started by students. After creating a user

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.420

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.090
