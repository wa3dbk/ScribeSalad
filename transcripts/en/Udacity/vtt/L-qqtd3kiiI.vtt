00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.980
As we go through the following steps
I'll give you intervals in which to

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.910
pause the video and
implement the steps on your own project.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.270
Feel free to do this or

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.820
to follow the whole video to the end and
try it all at once.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.960
I'll start by creating
an empty project and

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.579
then adding a method
called SandboxPlayground.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.790
You can pause here to do this step now.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.130
Now within this method we need to
create an instance of NSFileManager.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.438
This class allows us to find folders,
copy files, remove files etc.

00:00:33.438 --> 00:00:38.165
We'll use this to get the path to
the documents folder within our sandbox.

00:00:39.235 --> 00:00:44.275
Oddly enough, instead of a URL we're
going to get an array of URLs.

00:00:44.275 --> 00:00:45.545
What's going on?

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:46.805
Well, if we think about it,

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:50.155
there is actually more than
one documents folder, right.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:53.850
Remember, there is one for
each app installed.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.710
This method works by
returning all of them, but

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.620
since we are only asking for
one right now,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.560
we'll add in the second parameter to
filter out the ones that we don't need.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.290
Now we have an array with
just the one URL we need.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.420
So let's grab it.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.160
This is a URL to the documents folder,
but

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.730
I want a URL to the new
file I'm going to create.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.090
That's pretty easy, we only have
to add the name of the file.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.790
I'll do this now and then you can pause
the video and edit your own code.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.075
Okay, so
now we're ready to save something.

00:01:28.075 --> 00:01:32.295
We could use NSData or NSString,
both work in a very similar way.

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:36.185
Let's write the text inside
a string into a file.

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:39.650
There's nothing wrong with being
a little paranoid when it comes to code.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.470
So let's make sure we
wrote that correctly.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.160
How can we find that out?

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.970
Let's read it and
see if it's the same content.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.630
So did you try it on your end?

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.570
Works?

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.300
Perfect.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.440
Doesn't work, check out the companion
text and see if that helps.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.730
So right now we've just saved some data
to disk and retrieved it back, but

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.690
this doesn't exactly seem practical for
saving and retrieving tons of data,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.160
many different types of objects,
several versions of the data or

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.850
showing it in views and handling
it with controllers, and it isn't.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.580
But what we just did is
just the base concept.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.090
There are frameworks that
build on top of this.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.420
Let's see if Marty and
Doug have some ideas.
