00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.290
At this point, hopefully you feel like you can attack a new,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.100
big investigation, bring it within the scope of a statistical inference problem,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.140
and then apply iterations of the QMV process to gradually hone a solution.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.120
You've seen a taste of what model building and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.040
data analysis problems looks like in the real world.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.380
And how it is a continual process of investigation, finding results and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.180
then proposing new lines of investigation based upon those results.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.590
Sometimes retrying and adjusting previous decisions.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.400
Specifically we get the process going by iterating on an initial question,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.500
until we arrive at answers to the following.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.890
What metric will we be using to capture the phenomenon?

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.090
What statistical inference problem will we be examining?

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.970
What features will inform the inference problem?

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.840
Once we've determined how to measure the problem, as well as what form of

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.160
question we'll be answering, we enter the modeling phase,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.030
in which we choose a method for answering this question.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.830
Ideally, this method should take advantage of any

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.150
structure within the data that achieves the maximum effectiveness.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.640
Lastly, once we've built a model.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.630
We evaluate how good the model is at generalizing to the wider phenomenon in

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.870
the validation phase.
