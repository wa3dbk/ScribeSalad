00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.570
So, the answer is many of the properties are

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.710
desirable. The second property is desirable. So, the first property

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.940
is not desirable. That if the hash function outputs a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.040
unique number for every keyword, well then, the range for

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.780
the hash function would be very large. We'd need

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.270
a huge amount of memory to store the hash table.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.360
And the number of buckets would be the same as

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.860
the number of keyboards. That's not going to work very well.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.210
What we want is the number of buckets to be b, so

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.590
that means that the output of the hash function should be in

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.550
the range between 0 and b minus 1. That will find the

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.890
element of the list that corresponds to that bucket. So, we do want

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.660
the second property. The third and the fourth properties say that we

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.790
want the number of keywords in each bucket to be approximately the

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.720
same. So, if there are k keywords and we're fitting them into

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.030
b buckets, if we want the buckets to be approximately the same size,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.960
then each bucket should have approximately k divided by b keywords.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.590
So, both the third and the fourth property are true. The

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.250
final property says that we should have more keywords in bucket

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.690
zero than in bucket one. There's no reason that we would prefer

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.650
that, so you, you might think it would be better to

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.790
have more keywords at the beginning than later on, that's not

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.040
the case with a hash table. Remember, what our hash function

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.640
does is, it tells us right away which bucket to go through.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.850
We don't have to look through the earlier buckets. This

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.440
is different from the list index that we started with.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.930
Where the first one is the fastest one to find.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.580
And the last one requires going through all the elements.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.870
For the hash table, that's not the case. There's no

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.210
reason to prefer having more entries in bucket zero to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.540
bucket one. What we really want is to try to

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.140
have all the buckets have approximately the same number of keywords.
