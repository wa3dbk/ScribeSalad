00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.400
The word mip in the name mipmap is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase multum

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.898
in parvo, meaning "much in a small space." This is an excellent description, as

00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:10.131
all the extra textures generated in the mipmap pyramid don't take up much

00:00:10.131 --> 00:00:16.875
space, but prove themselves quite useful. So the question to you is this. Given

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:23.250
a 32 by 32 by 1 channel texture, Memory taken up is 1024 bytes. How much memory

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.100
is used in total by a mid map version of this texture?
