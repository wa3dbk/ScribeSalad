00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.795
I'm here with Dr Markie Blumer, who used to be my professor for Human Sexuality

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:08.164
when I was in my undergraduate. And, I was also her teaching assistant for a

00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:11.966
semester. Can you tell us a little bit about your background? I am a licenced

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:16.250
marriage and family therapist, I am also a licenced mental health counselor.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.667
I'm, I'm an approved supervisor with the American Association for Marriage and

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:24.596
Family Therapy. I began teaching about human sexuality in 1998 as an assistant

00:00:24.596 --> 00:00:29.611
at the Northern Arizona University. Starting in the fall 2013, I will be an

00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:34.070
associate professor at the University of Wisconsin at the stout location. And

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.334
that'll be in the human development family studies program and marriage and

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:41.190
family therapy program. For the last four years, I've been an assistant

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.971
professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. And my PhD is in human

00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:48.388
development and family studies with an emphasis in marriage and family therapy

00:00:48.388 --> 00:00:50.692
from Iowa State University.

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:55.642
&gt;&gt; So what are the stages of the human sexual response? Yeah, great question,

00:00:55.642 --> 00:01:00.382
actually that depends on who stages we're talking about. So Helen Singer Kaplan

00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:05.767
came up with a three phase cycle of the human sexual response. Which included

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:10.974
the desire phase, an arousal phase and then ended with an orgasm phase. Masters

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:14.855
and Johnsons came up with a four stage model. So a little bit different than

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:18.987
Kaplan's model. And their four stage model included an excitement phase, a

00:01:18.987 --> 00:01:24.164
plateau phase, an orgasm phase and a resolution phase. So really the biggest

00:01:24.164 --> 00:01:27.876
difference was the resolution phase. In other words, they though that there

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:30.660
were something that happened after people reach a plateau or a peek of

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.030
excitement through orgasm. And that was kind of this refractory period that

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.212
people go through. Where their bodies go back to more of a normative state

00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:43.468
before arousal occurred. Both of these models are great from a western point of

00:01:43.468 --> 00:01:48.116
view. there's, there's nothing wrong with these models. They, they match human

00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:53.080
physiology in a pretty normative way. What's problematic about them however is

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.436
not everybody Is situated to understand sexuality and sexual response cycles

00:01:57.436 --> 00:02:02.754
from a western point of view. In eastern cultures, there are kind of different

00:02:02.754 --> 00:02:06.210
ways of conceptualizing sexuality which would be through more like tantric

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.865
practices. Which doesn't really have this rigid here are the phases of sexual

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:16.064
response cycle that you must complete in order for it to be successful. So,

00:02:16.064 --> 00:02:19.950
really those practices are more like, you might be aroused and then you might

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.023
kind of take a break and then you might become aroused again. and then you

00:02:25.023 --> 00:02:29.018
might engage in sexual activity with each other. But rather than having an

00:02:29.018 --> 00:02:32.129
orgasm, be say the goal for one person, it might just be a goal for one of the

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.650
other people involved. One person might just might take their time and the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.650
other person might be orgasming multiple times. And maybe one partner never

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.658
orgasms and, and that would be considered a great sexual encounter. So really

00:02:44.658 --> 00:02:48.088
it just depends on where you are on the globe. Like I said here in Western

00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:51.100
Culture we have kind of these two ways of thinking about sex.
