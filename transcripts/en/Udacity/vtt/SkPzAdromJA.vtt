00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.310
This course is meant to tell the stories our genomes hold for us,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.700
both known and unknown. Now, depending on

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.260
your perspective this can mean different things.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.900
&gt;&gt; The lessons here will cover what genomes are and how they work.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.470
We'll learn how genetic information changes over time, and how it's passed down.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.400
&gt;&gt; We'll learn about how some traits

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.900
are controlled by few genes and other traits

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.660
are controlled by many genes. Genes. Ultimately,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.170
we'll see how we can use genetics to

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.240
trace our past and see how we're all

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.280
connected, all the while, we'll be getting first hand

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.729
accounts about certain traits and learning about the

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.550
social implications of knowing the genetic information underlying them.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.170
By the end of this course, you'll have

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.870
a solid grasp of genetic information. And how it's

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.660
organized into a genome and affects a myriad of

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.830
traits. So get ready for tales from the genome.
