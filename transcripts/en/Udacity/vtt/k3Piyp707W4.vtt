00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.336
Let's see if we can use our new system of equations to problem solve. Here's

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:08.563
our first problem. It would take 42 feet of fencing to enclose the rectangular

00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:14.132
patio. If the area of the patio is 108 square feet, what are the dimensions of

00:00:14.132 --> 00:00:19.164
the patio? So, here, this is my patio in black and then, this orange part is my

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:24.088
fencing. Now, this view isn't so helpful. We're going to take a bird's eye

00:00:24.088 --> 00:00:28.545
view, and look down into our patio to figure this problem out. Essentially, our

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:33.216
pattern looks like this. It's a rectangle in shape, and it has a length and it

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:39.240
has a width. What we want to do is take our equations for perimeter and area.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.483
And make them into two equations with a system of two variables. In other

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:48.572
words, we just want to have two equations with only l and w in them. Since we

00:00:48.572 --> 00:00:52.796
know it would take 42 feet of fencing to enclose our rectangular patio We know

00:00:52.796 --> 00:00:58.560
that the perimeter equals 42 feet. Notice that eh perimeter is even, so we can

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.709
divide each of these by two to get a new equation that is 21 equals l plus w.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.919
We know the area of the patio is 108 square feet, so we can replace this area

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:15.857
with the value of 108. Now, notice that we have two equations with two

00:01:15.857 --> 00:01:20.660
variables, l and w. This is a system of equations, and we've solved something

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.990
like this before. We're going to go ahead and solve this system using

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.440
substitution. First I'm going to subtract w from both sides of this equation to

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.934
get 21 minus w equals L. So, now I want you to use substitution to solve this

00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:40.715
system of equations. We know the length equals 21w, so we can replace this

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:46.345
length with 21 minus w. I want you to make this substitution and then solve for

00:01:46.345 --> 00:01:50.868
the width and the length. After you solve, the length should be the longer side

00:01:50.868 --> 00:01:55.288
between the two. As a hint, when you substitute 21 minus w in for l, you should

00:01:55.288 --> 00:02:00.716
wind up with something that's quadratic. Use what you know about factoring, and

00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:04.260
try and find the length and the width. Good luck here.
