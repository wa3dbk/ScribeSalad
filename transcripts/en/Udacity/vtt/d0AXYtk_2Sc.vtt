So now that we've played Avatar's movie trailer, here's your

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.190
challenge. I want you to comment out this line, the

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.470
line that shows the trailer for Avatar. Then, I want

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.490
you to create a new object, but this time of your

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.170
favorite movie, and I want you to play its trailer

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.510
instead. Here are the instructions one more time. Much like Toy

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.120
Story and Avatar, we want you to create a new

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.610
instance or object of the class Movie. Once you've done that,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.110
we want you to play a trailer of that

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.610
movie using the new instance or object. And finally,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.610
we want you to share a screenshot of your

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.390
program's output on the discussion forum. Now, in case you

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.250
have a way to video record your computer screen,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.490
perhaps using a smartphone, you can also share a Youtube

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.000
video of your output with us. Make sure to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.590
check this box after submitting your response on the forum.
