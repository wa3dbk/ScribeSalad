00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.200
We're going to use AdWords as an example
to help you build the mindset around

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.510
creating online campaigns while
focusing on search engine marketing.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.750
Many of the things you need to consider
when building AdWords campaigns

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.120
are similar to what you do in
creating any online campaign.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.080
Such as the structure,
the target audience, tracking,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.310
measurement and more.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.630
&gt;&gt; AdWords works by having
companies bid for keywords.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.290
When a potential customer searches
a keyword in Google search,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.790
there is an auction behind the scenes
that automatically resulted

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.640
with the winner ads shown up at
the top of the search results.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.590
&gt;&gt; Winners will be decided by a formula
that takes into consideration

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.750
both the relevance of the ad and
the bid.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.170
So let's get started by building our
AdWords campaign using Abarkment as

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.530
an example.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.050
&gt;&gt; So I'm Andrea, I have been working
at Google for about four years.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.020
Mostly the whole time been working
with AdWords advertising customers.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.449
Supporting small,

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.247
medium businesses as well as some
of the Fortune 500 companies.

00:01:00.247 --> 00:01:03.581
And so, it's given me a lot
of experience to work with

00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:08.250
all different advertisers and to see
how AdWords can really be flexible for

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.461
advertisers of all kinds, all different
businesses, with all different goals.

00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:17.454
So Google is really great at
serving as a platform for

00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:20.920
advertisers who want to
drive app downloads.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.535
Specifically, I think Google Search
is going to be the best

00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:32.285
first step for
anyone who wants to promote their app.

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:36.120
Google search is going to
provide the opportunity for

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.758
users to find your app,
especially when they're looking for

00:01:40.758 --> 00:01:44.161
a product that your app
can meet their needs.

00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:47.725
So for example, if a user is going to
be searching for shopping apps,

00:01:47.725 --> 00:01:51.864
they're going to go to google.com,
look for a best shopping app, and that's

00:01:51.864 --> 00:01:56.320
an opportunity where you can serve
your add for those types of queries.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.710
Additionally, we've just opened
up Google Play inventory so,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.720
when users are looking for
apps within the Google Play Store,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.669
you can now show your ads within
the results on Google Play.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:13.150
So again, if the user is looking for
shopping or

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.080
shopping apps or whatever it might be.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.510
They can search within Google Play and

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.850
that will give you an opportunity
to show your ads there as well.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.460
Depending on your experience
with AdWords, setting up an app

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.050
promotion campaign is similar to any
other type of Google Search campaign.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.930
But, if you haven't used AdWords in
the past, it's really easy to onboard.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.932
A user can sign up online without any
support from Google specifically.

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:51.895
So you can just go online and create
an AdWords account but beyond that,

00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:56.211
you want to create a campaign
specifically for app promotion.

00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:59.068
And that is an easy process.

00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:04.258
It just walks you through different
steps for setting up your budget

00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:09.830
as well as your targeting and
then you can enter in your ad creatives.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.890
So, when you set up your keyword lists,

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.669
you want to remember to think
about themes for your keyword set.

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.327
So ideally, you separate a couple
different ad groups with different

00:03:21.327 --> 00:03:22.754
themes for your keywords.

00:03:22.754 --> 00:03:25.256
You want to be as
specific as possible and

00:03:25.256 --> 00:03:27.839
as relevant as possible to your product.

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:32.045
So again, back to the shopping app,

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:39.101
you want to have terms that would
be related to a shopping app or

00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:43.187
best deals online or shop locally.

00:03:43.187 --> 00:03:46.439
Those are the type of terms you
want to be thinking about and

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.947
what's really the value
of your product and

00:03:48.947 --> 00:03:52.050
then how do your key words
match up to your product.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.300
So keep those as relevant as possible,
and

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.340
then also separate an ad group for
your brand terms.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.090
So obviously you want to capture
anyone who's searching for your brand.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.692
Or terms that are most
similar to your brand.

00:04:06.692 --> 00:04:08.790
You want to make sure that
anyone whose looking for

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.390
you is able to easily find you.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.880
So those are the things you want to
be thinking about with keywords.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.115
You want to make sure they're just
really relevant to your product,

00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:18.022
to your business.

00:04:18.022 --> 00:04:22.368
And that they're going to capture
users when they're searching and

00:04:22.368 --> 00:04:24.780
trying to find a product like yours.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.130
AdWords is great for
small advertisers, for startups.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.790
It's really a platform that
allows small advertisers

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.560
to compete in the big leagues as well,
because it really does come down to

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.130
the quality of your product and
the value proposition of your business.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.920
So, as long as you can really
communicate that in your ads and

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.860
figure out the keywords that
work best for your business,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.486
then those are the auctions that you
really could see yourself perform and

00:04:57.486 --> 00:05:00.600
outdo any of the competitors.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.930
So that does take some testing in
figuring out which keywords are best for

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.222
your business.

00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:11.300
You want to stray away from some
of the really expensive terms or

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.568
really broad terms.

00:05:12.568 --> 00:05:16.938
So if I'm selling shoes, I don't want to

00:05:16.938 --> 00:05:21.573
bid on terms like shoes or
women's shoes.

00:05:21.573 --> 00:05:24.220
That's going to be really broad and
that's going to be really expensive.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.300
And those are the types of terms
that you might see some of those big

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.650
companies.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.740
They can afford to to be showing ads for
those really broad terms.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.600
But you want to think,
what is your product do best?

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.890
How can you be as specific as possible
to capture the users that are looking

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.090
for something that you can provide?

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.160
So for example,
if user is specifically looking for

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.950
a certain type of shoe that you sell.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.260
That's what you want,
your keyword and your ad to convey.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.558
So, I think that's what's
great about AdWords is that,

00:06:00.558 --> 00:06:05.405
it is an auction and it does
create a level playing field where

00:06:05.405 --> 00:06:09.603
you can decide which terms
do you really care about?

00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:13.109
Those are the terms that you're
willing to bid on and pay per click.

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:16.742
And if you can communicate
that within your ad and

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:21.258
drive them to the best landing
page that you can offer a user,

00:06:21.258 --> 00:06:27.450
then I think you have a really good
chance of those ads delivering for you.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.780
So one advantage to Google AdWords
is with Android users,

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.198
we actually don't need to set
up any additional tracking.

00:06:36.198 --> 00:06:38.050
So we do have a code list tracking,

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.920
and that's just because Google
owns the Android platform.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.359
So we're able to know when
users download the app.

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:50.716
You can see when a user
actually clicked on your ad and

00:06:50.716 --> 00:06:55.002
then when they actually downloaded
the app, all within AdWords.

00:06:55.002 --> 00:06:57.680
Now, as far as iOS and tracking that,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.897
that's where you need an additional
tracking system outside of Google.

00:07:02.897 --> 00:07:07.355
So that's where you're going to have
to research for a third-party SDKs.

00:07:07.355 --> 00:07:12.670
But yeah, there's a lot of great things
that you can do to get started with

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.991
AdWords that don't require a lot of
additional technical integration or

00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:19.850
implementation.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.620
A lot of it is pretty much all there for
you within AdWords.
