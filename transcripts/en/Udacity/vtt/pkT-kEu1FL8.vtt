00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.490
Now we have to test this.

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.040
Let's go back to test provider once more.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.840
It'll be helpful to parameterize our tests
a little bit more,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.510
both for location and for date.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.620
All right, now that we've
parameterized our tests,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.570
Let's go back at looking into
our insert read provider.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.490
For the weather, we're currently using
the raw content URI to query.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.260
But we can also query on additional data.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.350
By cutting and pasting this test,
we can try the test

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.130
with different query parameters.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.490
We'll close the cursor
because it's good practice.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.150
Now for our second weather query,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.230
we're going to test
the first of our new URIs:

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.710
WeatherEntry.buildweatherlocation

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.413
and we can use
our new test location parameter.

00:00:42.413 --> 00:00:45.256
All right. Let's try running this test.

00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:47.690
And our test passed.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.370
All right. We're going to
add one more test

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.580
with a slight variation on the query

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.300
using build weather location
with start date instead.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.670
So, we're going to use test location
as well as test date.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.550
And now, let's run those tests.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.863
And our tests pass.

00:01:01.993 --> 00:01:05.726
Now, sometimes it's useful
to actually demonstrate a test failure.

00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:10.900
Let's put in a date
that's certainly going to fail: 20150624.

00:01:13.146 --> 00:01:15.622
We would expect this test to fail.

00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:18.390
Let's try it and indeed it fails.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.050
So we're pretty sure that our tests
are actually doing what we expect them to.
