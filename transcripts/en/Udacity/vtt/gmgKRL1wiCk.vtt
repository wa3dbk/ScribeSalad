00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and add these properties to this class.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is how you do it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You say title=db.StringProperty.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is in the database module from Google,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and this is how you say something is a particular type.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You give your property name, and then you say equals, and then you give the type.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is the class that represents the string type--string.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm going to add another parameter here--required-True.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And this sets a constraint on the database.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It means if we try to make an instance of art

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
without giving it a title,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we will get an exception--Python won't let us do that--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which is handy.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You want to always have as many constraints as you reasonably can

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to prevent you from making silly mistakes

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and putting bad data into your database.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Having bad data in your database is really annoying.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Sometimes it's really hard to find

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
because you don't have the appropriate keys to do your queries to look it up.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So constraints are important, and this is a handy one

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that Google provides--required=True.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Let's add another field. This is our art.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This is going to be a db.TextProperty.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This will also be required=True.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Simple enough.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Actually, the first time I wrote this I used the string property,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and then I got through this whole project

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and all of a sudden I couldn't paste in ASCII art longer than 500 characters.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So text is handy there.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And we're also going to add our last field for created,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
which will be a DateTimeProperty.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And this takes another parameter called

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
auto<u>now</u>add=true.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And what this property does

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
is it automatically--when we create an instance of art--

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
we'll set the created to be the current time, right now.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So we don't have to actually deal with that ourselves.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This is really handy.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Now, you may be thinking this is an awful lot to know.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You don't have to know this.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This is all in the Google Datastore docs.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So when you're working on your homework and stuff, please have those docs handy.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It will save you a lot of heartache.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
There's some interesting stuff in there. This is one of them--auto<u>now</u>add.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Okay, so that's all we have to do to define a type,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
or at least our simple type here.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Let's go ahead and start creating these things.
