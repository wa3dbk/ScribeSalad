There are 2 parts to this problem, the first part is saving the vertex in the

00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:09.531
geometry object. This is pretty straight forward and you've seen it before. You

00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:14.125
add a point to the vertices. The trickier part is generating the faces. There

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:17.177
are a number of ways to do this, here's mine. You may recall from the

00:00:17.177 --> 00:00:21.532
triangulation exercises that a polygon with some number of points generates

00:00:21.532 --> 00:00:26.925
points minus 2 triangles. The loop here uses this fact with face looping through

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:31.811
this many triangles. My loop makes this kind of fan with all the triangles

00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:35.733
including this top most point and radiating out from there.
