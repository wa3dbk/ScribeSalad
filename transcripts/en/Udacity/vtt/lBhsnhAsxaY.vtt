&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5 feet. We can't add a negative to something to make it bigger. We can of

00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:09.537
course check this answer, too. Remember that we started off with the equation 15

00:00:09.537 --> 00:00:14.037
plus x times 10 plus x equals 300. Let's see if 5 satisfies this. For the

00:00:14.037 --> 00:00:19.029
left-hand side, we'll have 15 plus 5 times 10 plus 5, which is just 20 times 15,

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.521
which is 300. And the right-hand side is just equal to 300. So, we're good. 5

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:27.777
feet is the right answer.
