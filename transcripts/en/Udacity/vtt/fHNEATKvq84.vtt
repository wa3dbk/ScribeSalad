00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.900
By rejecting the null, we know that at least two of the foods differ in terms

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.710
of mean amount consumed. But we don't know which ones differ. We can see that

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.634
all three of the means differ from each other. But we don't know if these

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:18.130
differences are due to sampling error. Therefore, we need to do additional

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.328
testing to see which means are different. This additional testing is called

00:00:22.328 --> 00:00:26.793
Multiple Comparison Tests. So we're able to compare all of the means with each

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:32.900
other. We wouldn't do a multiple comparison test until after we've done ANOVA.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.188
One of the most common multiple comparison test is called Tukey's HSD, which

00:00:37.188 --> 00:00:43.144
stands for Honestly Significant Difference. It's named after John Tukey, a very

00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:48.469
influential statistician. Tukey's HSD evaluates the significance of the

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.170
difference between any two group means. In statistics, we say that this test

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.734
will allow us to make pairwise comparisons. The way that we calculate Tukey's

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:03.494
HSD is just like the margin of error that you've learned before. Remember that

00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:08.742
with the Z-test, it was the Z critical value denoted Z star times the standard

00:01:08.742 --> 00:01:14.315
error. And remember with the t-test, it was the t critical value times the

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:18.930
standard error. Recall that this is approximately equal to half the width of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.200
the confidence interval. But now when we're comparing three or more samples, we

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.593
have a new statistic called q. And we multiply this by the square root of the

00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:35.192
mean square for within subject variability divided by n. You might ask how is

00:01:35.192 --> 00:01:39.872
this similar to these, well the mean square for within subject variability is

00:01:39.872 --> 00:01:46.102
the pooled variance. It's just the average square deviation of each value from

00:01:46.102 --> 00:01:51.492
its respective group mean. Therefore, the square root is the pooled standard

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:58.180
deviation. q is the studentized range statistic. And we find this in yet

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.470
another table. Its purpose is to adjust the whole HSD, so that it's less likely

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.475
we commit a type 1 error. Remember, a type 1 error is when we reject the null

00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:14.400
hypothesis when it's actually true. Since q increases, when there are more

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.560
groups that we're comparing, it makes it less likely to commit a type 1 error.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.976
Remember that if a sample mean was further away from the population mean than

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:30.592
the margin of error, it was considered unlikely? Well, if two sample means are

00:02:30.592 --> 00:02:35.986
further apart than the Tukey's HSD, then that's considered honestly

00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:39.706
significantly different.
