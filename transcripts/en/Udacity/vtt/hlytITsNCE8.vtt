You saw how to find the first match and also return if there are no matches.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.720
But what if you want to find out where the first match occurs? In our Alice in

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.490
Wonderland example, maybe we find the first long word and then find out how far

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.984
in that occurs to get some idea of how common long words really are. This is

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:22.360
where the program left off. How would you modify it to return the position of

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.305
the first long word? As well as that the long word was. Remember, the position

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:30.529
of the first word would be zero, and the position of the second word would be

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.829
one.
