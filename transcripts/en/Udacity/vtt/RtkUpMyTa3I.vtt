00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.500
Notice that the two symbols to enclose the ranges of values listed down here are

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.883
square brackets and round parentheses, just like we see on our number line.

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:13.305
Since up here, we have a square bracket to include the negative 2 in our range,

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:17.583
and we have a round parentheses to not include the 6, we'll just match those

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:21.974
with either end of the interval that they belong to down here. So this is the

00:00:21.974 --> 00:00:22.953
correct answer.
