all of these tasks if an artificial agent that we design accomplishes the task,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.870
we're able to go back and look at its reasoning, look at its processing, and

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.280
figure out exactly how it did it. So it's never going to be unexpected.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.920
It's always the output of a predictable algorithm. Interesting [UNKNOWN] David.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.500
Not sure I agree with it. Let's discuss it further.
