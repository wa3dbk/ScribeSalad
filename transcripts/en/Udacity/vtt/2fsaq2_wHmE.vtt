00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.510
Now you may have heard of other
types of orders besides just buy and

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.590
sell, market and limit.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.360
It turns out though that the exchanges
only execute these types of orders.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.710
They don't execute those other types.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.380
Well, you might wonder,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.830
okay, how do those other types
of orders come into being?

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.950
These other types of orders
are implemented by your broker.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.860
The way that works is you
enter this order type and

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.030
I'll give you a couple
examples in just a second.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.330
The broker holds that order and watches
the market until the conditions that you

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.700
specified are met and
then when those conditions are met,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.790
the broker sends your order
to the market accordingly.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.250
So here's some examples.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.430
Stop loss is a kind of order
where you say when the stock

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.030
drops to a certain price,
I want you to sell it.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.330
Stop gain.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.780
Similarly, when the stock
reaches a certain higher price,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.690
I want you to sell it.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.460
Trailing stop is a combination
of stop loss but

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.490
also an automatically changing value for
when that criteria is met.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.635
So for instance, you might have
this trailing stop remain say,

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:08.220
$0.10 behind the price.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.730
So as the price goes up, the value at
which you would want to sell the stock

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.260
goes up along with the price,
but when it drops down below.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.860
Then that stop loss is triggered.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.210
But probably the most important and
most impactful kind of order

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.100
the brokers implement for
you is something called selling short.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.260
What selling short allows you to do is
take a negative position on a stock,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.320
in other words,

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.910
you sell a stock short if you believe
its price is going to go down.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.930
Keep in mind here we're selling
stock we don't even own.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.710
So how is that possible?

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.560
Well, again, it's possible because
the broker facilitates it for you, and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.620
I'll explain how in just a minute.
