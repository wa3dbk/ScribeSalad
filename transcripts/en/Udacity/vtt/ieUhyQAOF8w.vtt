00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.942
Our task was to go through all of the elements and the list of the drawables,

00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:09.585
to check which ones are movable. That's done with the instance of operator. Now

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:13.160
then we wanted to move them, but of course, we have convert them from drawables

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.818
to moveables, that's done with this cast. Take the drawable, cast to moveable,

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:23.732
save it in a moveable variable, and then we can use that variable to exercise

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:29.563
the move method. When we run the program, we see the cars move, we see the dogs

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:36.115
move, which is really isn't moving experience. Now, I'll turn it over to Sara,

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:40.855
who will talk to you more about interfaces, the instance of operator and

00:00:40.855 --> 00:00:43.142
casting.
