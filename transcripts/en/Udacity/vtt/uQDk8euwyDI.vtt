00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.196
So, this seems like a really brain-dead way of doing things a bit. Maybe that's

00:00:03.196 --> 00:00:06.436
good enough. We need to look at how we are actually using this procedure. If

00:00:06.436 --> 00:00:09.404
we're going to use it for a human to tell how many days old they are, in an

00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:12.796
interactive way, the fact that we have to wait 300th of a second for the answer

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:16.418
doesn't matter, that's plenty fast enough. Getting that down to less than a

00:00:16.418 --> 00:00:19.930
100th of a second is not worth extra effort. If we are using it in a service,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.290
that's doing this computation lots and lots of times for lots and lots of

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.042
different dates, well then, maybe it's not fast enough and it's worth putting time

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:30.851
and effort to doing something better. But we shouldn't put that time and effort

00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:34.660
until we know that we need it to be faster. This point is important enough that

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.108
I want to put it in our guide to solving our problems. So, we have our first

00:00:38.108 --> 00:00:41.618
steps, don't panic, make sure we understand the inputs and the outputs, works

00:00:41.618 --> 00:00:44.966
through some examples by hand to think about how we would solve the problem

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:48.898
systematically. And then, try to develop a simple mechanical solution. And the

00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:52.378
key here is simplicity, the simpler it is, the more likely we're going to be

00:00:52.378 --> 00:00:56.076
able to program it correctly. Eventually, we might need to worry about making it

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:58.593
faster, but let's not worry about that until we have to.
