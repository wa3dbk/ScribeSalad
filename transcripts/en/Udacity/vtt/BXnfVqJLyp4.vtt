00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.320
The last thing that I want to mention about class diagrams is

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.830
some creation tips. So something I know based on my experience and the

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.300
experience of others, I can recommend to do when creating a class

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.780
diagram. So the first tip is to understand the problem. So take the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.070
time to look at the description of the system that you have

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.500
to build, to make sure that you understand the domain. That you understand

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.230
what you are supposed to build. Because that is going to save you

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.550
time later. It's going to help you identify from the beginning, a more relevant

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.370
set of entities in the description of the system. This

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.730
one might seem trivial but is very important to choose

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.910
good class names. Why? Because class names communicate the intent

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.770
of the class, and clarify what the class refers to. So

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.510
having a good class name allows you, makes it easier, to

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.390
create the mapping between the real-world object and the entities in

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.610
your model. And of course, it also makes it easier

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.100
to understand the system, after the system is built. Third tip,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.480
concentrate on the what. So here, in the class diagram,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.390
we're just representing the structure of the system. We're representing

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.150
what is in the system. What are the entities? What

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.140
are the characteristics of the entities? We are not focusing

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.850
at all, on how things are done. So, be careful.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.430
DonÃ¢Â€Â™t think about the how, just think about the what.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.150
Proceed in an itinerary way. So, start with a simple

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.910
diagram and refine it. There is no need to identify,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.650
right away, all of the details of the system you need to

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.570
build. It is much easier to look at the description, identify an initial

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.670
rough class diagram and then refine it, because in this way, you'll

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.650
also gather more understanding of the system as you build it, and you'll

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.670
most likely end up with a better product at the end. And

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.360
if you proceed in this way, then make sure to refine until you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.920
feel the class diagram is complete, until you feel that you represent

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.960
the system that you're supposed to build. So your final goal should be

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.820
to have a class diagram that is complete.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.870
So it represents all of the relevant entities

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.870
in the system and their characteristics, and it's

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.170
correct so it represents them in the right way
