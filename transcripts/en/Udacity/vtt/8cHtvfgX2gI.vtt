00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.193
Let's consider another system of equations. When we perform substitution, we

00:00:04.193 --> 00:00:08.162
need to choose one variable and one of the equations that is easiest to solve

00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:12.128
for. For example, in this equation, we want to think, is it easier to get x

00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:16.225
alone, or y alone? Also, we could consider the other equation. Do we want to

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:20.482
solve for this x, or this y? We need one of these equations to be in the form, x

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:24.860
equals something, or y equals something in order to perform substitution. So,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.557
what do you think in this case? Which of these variables would be easiest to

00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:32.037
solve for? Choose the best one. If you actually solve for some of these

00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:35.946
variables, you might see that some are better than others. Think about why that

00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:42.115
is. Maybe some have negatives. Maybe some have fractions. You want the easiest

00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:42.499
one.
