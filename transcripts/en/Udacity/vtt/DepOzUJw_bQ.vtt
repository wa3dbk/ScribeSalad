00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.838
What does this mean? Depending on our criteria for what constitutes likely or

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:09.311
unlikely if we get a sample mean in the critical region here for a one-tailed

00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:15.976
test or here or here for a two-tailed test. Then we decide that most likely we

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:20.520
did not get this sample mean by chance. Note that in the case of a two-tailed

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.744
test. The z-critical values are the same used to calculate confidence

00:00:24.744 --> 00:00:30.410
intervals, Here, you're just applying the same ideals to different situations.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.180
When we do statistical test, we'll set our own criteria for making a decision,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.121
in other words, we'll choose an alpha level. And then we'll decide that if the

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:42.593
probability of obtaining a particular sample mean is less than that alpha

00:00:42.593 --> 00:00:47.680
level, Then there's evidence of an effect. Usually we're going to stick with an

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.450
alpha level of point zero five. At an alpha level of point zero five we have

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.774
two possible outcomes in either situation, one tailed or two tailed. Either the

00:00:57.774 --> 00:01:03.500
sample mean will lie outside of the critical or inside the critical region. We

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.861
notate these two outcomes as the null hypothesis. Which we call h not or h sub

00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:15.780
zero and the alternative hypothesis h sub a. Other ways of notating this could

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.297
be h sub one but I'll just stick with h sub a for alternative. The null

00:01:20.297 --> 00:01:23.816
hypothesis assumes that there is not significant difference between the current

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:28.446
population parameters. And what will be the new population parameters after

00:01:28.446 --> 00:01:33.500
some sort of intervention. So we'll notate it like current population parameter

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.120
mu is equal to the population parameters after the intervention, where when we

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.740
say equal, we don't mean exactly equal, we just mean they're not significantly

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.100
different. The alternative hypothesis guesses that there will be a significant

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.654
difference. Either the current population mean will be less than that after the

00:01:54.654 --> 00:02:00.290
intervention, or the current population mean will be greater. Or that it'll

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.310
just be different, and we don't predict a direction of the treatment. For the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.270
null hypothesis, when we're guessing that there's no significant difference

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.110
between these two parameters Our sample mean will lie somewhere outside the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.946
critical region, in this white space. Note, also, that for a 1-tailed test the

00:02:17.946 --> 00:02:22.756
critical region could be on the left tail, not just the right. And the

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:26.620
alternative hypothesis guesses that there is a significant difference, and that

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.223
means that our sample mean will lie somewhere in the critical region.
