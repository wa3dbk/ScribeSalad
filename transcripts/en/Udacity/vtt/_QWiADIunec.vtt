00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We can answer this question pretty quickly with the help of a little program.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Like before I've got this make_link function, and I'm going to make an empty graph

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
with 256 nodes which is going to be arranged a grid--a number nodes per row and column

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
on a side here is the square root of n or 16.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Then what we're going to do is we're going to run through all the pairs of nodes in the graph

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
i, n, j, and for each one if it's not on the very edge, we're going to make a link--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
well, if it's not on the bottom edge, then we're going to make a link downward.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If it's on the right edge, we're going to make a link to the right. That's going to build our gird.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So, we print out the number of edges in this graph that we created and we get 480.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We could do that kind of by reasoning as well, that just like in this grid example before

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the little chain that we have going across is the number of nodes in a column minus 1,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and there are five of them because there are five rows.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In this case there will be 16 of them.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
There will be 16 chains of length 15 across.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The downward ones are going to be the same, so we'll just double that.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We also get 480 that way.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It'd be nice to be able to answer this question in a little bit more generality.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
How many edges do we have in a grid graph?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We're assuming that there are n nodes and the nodes are arranged in a square.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The picture of that looks like this where you have nodes arranged in a square.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
For this to make sense, we're assuming that n is a perfect square,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
so that we can actually arrange the nodes and form a square as so.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
There's √n nodes on each of the sides, and if we fill in the edges, these green edges,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
what's the total amount that we get?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Well, the same basic idea as we used last time applies.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That is, the number of edges that go across in a chain here is going to be √n - 1.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That's going to be repeated for each of these rows.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And we're going to get the same kind of analysis for the edges that are going down.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So, what is that? That's 2n - 2√n.

00:01:51.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Does that give us the right answer when n is 256? Yes. Well, that's good.
