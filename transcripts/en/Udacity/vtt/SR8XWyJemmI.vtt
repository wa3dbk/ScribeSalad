00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.915
It's important to note, that we feel pride when we've accomplished something

00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:07.446
really important in our lives. Classic gesture of pride, is when we, raise our

00:00:07.446 --> 00:00:12.654
hands and clinch our fist, as we see when, athletes have won a competition. So

00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:17.746
pride comes in two distinct flavors. Authentic, and self inflated. So an

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:21.078
authentic pride happens when we, accomplish something that's really important

00:00:21.078 --> 00:00:26.122
but also very difficult. Like run a marathon. Get an A on a very difficult exam

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:31.098
or do well at work. Self inflated pride however, occurs just because we are

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:35.806
superior to other people or feel superior. So for instance, we might drive a

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:41.048
fancy car, have expensive clothes. So there's a superiority that occurs in

00:00:41.048 --> 00:00:45.239
self-inflated pride that isn't there in authentic pride.
