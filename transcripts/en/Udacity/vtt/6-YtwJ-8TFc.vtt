00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.580
Our task is to add an instance variable that counts the number of passengers.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.276
Here it is. Here I want to add a passenger to this car, so we will increment

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:17.586
our counter. But, of course, there's a twist. You can only add a passenger if

00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:22.921
there's room. So, we need to check if the number of passengers plus the one

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:27.372
that I want to add is less than the number of seats. Why not less equal than

00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:31.148
the number of seats? I still need one seat for the driver. So only in that case

00:00:31.148 --> 00:00:35.361
do I increment. So when I talk about patterns in general, the pattern that I

00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:38.448
described here says increment the counter, but it doesn't mean that you'll

00:00:38.448 --> 00:00:43.132
always have to increment the counter. The patterns gives you the broad outline

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:47.245
of what you have to do, and the details are different, in every situation.

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:52.645
After all if it was that simple, then you wouldn't be making the big bucks

00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:57.870
figuring out the answers. Finally, the getPassengerCount really is as simple as

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.344
you think, here we just return the numberOfPassengers. The point is again,

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:06.154
knowing that many classes keep a counter can help you when you have a situation

00:01:06.154 --> 00:01:13.211
where that is appropriate. Here, at the counter, you figure how does the count

00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:19.836
change, that's the case here. Here we increment the counter, and then here we

00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:24.964
have a simple and boring method to return. In this example, we just counted the

00:01:24.964 --> 00:01:29.350
number of passengers. What if we wanted to know who's actually in the car?

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.270
We'll turn to that next.
