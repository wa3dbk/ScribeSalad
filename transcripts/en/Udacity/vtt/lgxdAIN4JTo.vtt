00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.021
This is the graph of y equals x to the 4th. Now because this power is even just

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:09.998
like x squared, there's no real number that we can plug in for x, that's going

00:00:09.998 --> 00:00:14.535
to give us a negative answer for y. For example, negative 3 taken to the 4th

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.840
power is just four negative 3s multiplied together. And because there are an

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.064
even number of negative signs here, they're all going to cancel one another out

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:27.355
to give us a positive answer. Sure enough, this is positive 81. So what this

00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:31.645
parent graph, y equals x to the fourth, of fourth order polynomial functions,

00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:35.803
the lowest y value that we can have is going to be this point right here, when x

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:39.045
equals 0. This point is just the origin: zero, zero.
