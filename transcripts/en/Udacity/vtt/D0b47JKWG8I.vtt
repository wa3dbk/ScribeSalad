00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.080
I'm here with My Friend Michael who has night terrors. So Michael, when did you

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.625
figure out you had night terrors?

00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:09.971
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; When I was about 13 in my teen years and found out I was experiencing them a

00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:15.074
few times a week, even sometimes, like three times in a night, and my parents

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:20.795
just took me to the pediatrician.

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:23.205
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So what's it like to to live with night terrors?

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:31.004
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's exhausting. It's exhausting for me, it's exhausting for my wife. And like

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:35.096
when I was living with my parents, like family members just because they're

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:40.615
really intense. And at one point, I was having them every night, like sometimes

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:44.899
three times a night, but pretty much on a regular basis and that's, you know,

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.782
waking everybody up having to deal with the situation. And then, for myself,

00:00:51.782 --> 00:00:56.198
feeling like I was asleep the whole time, but really, I'm up sprinting around

00:00:56.198 --> 00:01:00.545
screaming my lungs off at whatever was going on and, and not, not knowing the

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:05.640
next morning like why I was exhausted.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.665
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And what's it like to have a night terror episode?

00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:12.182
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sometimes, they are totally fuzzy. I don't know what I did at all, until

00:01:12.182 --> 00:01:17.127
somebody wakes me up and tells me. Other times, you would remember everything

00:01:17.127 --> 00:01:20.909
and, and the one that was the most terrifying for me, because, I was the only

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.813
one that would wake myself up from them was when somebody was coming after me,

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:31.832
whether it was maybe it was like a giant spider. It was like a person like

00:01:31.832 --> 00:01:35.602
lurking in the room and you just be totally still, eyes wide open really

00:01:35.602 --> 00:01:40.832
sweating. And, I was afraid for my life that if I budged or moved at all that

00:01:40.832 --> 00:01:44.924
this, this spider or this person or whatever it was would come after me and,

00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:52.124
and kill me or whatever. And, those were terrifying because you're just, you're

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:58.743
frozen and you're seeing everything. Nobody's waking me up, nothing. I'm just

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:05.558
still. All by myself and having to wake up from that on my own. The consistent

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:10.045
thing no matter if somebody wakes me up or if waking up myself from those ones

00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:16.535
that are still, you're just always the next day, bags under the eyes. You're

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:20.751
just tired all the time, because you're, you're, you're running around in your

00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:25.239
sleep, like you're, you're, you're exerting energy in a time when you should be

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.659
relaxed and your body should be refreshing itself, like you should be getting

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:37.151
energy back. Another thing that I, I've discovered is I get, I get really mad.

00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:41.506
I'm like very aggressive when, I'm like, coming back out of that, that dream or

00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:48.440
whatever's going on. That I'm very I'm just very pissed off. I'm yelling at my

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.578
wife, like, stop it, no, I'm not, just leave me alone. And then the next thing

00:02:54.578 --> 00:02:59.600
that comes into that phase is just total shame. I'm just very embarrassed, kind

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.297
of curl up, just I, I don't, I, because I, whatever you see, I swear it's

00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:10.511
there, I know it's there. It's just like looking at you right now, I swear that

00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:14.159
you're there, but then, somebody wakes me up and goes, no you're, you're just

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.693
having a night terror, like and, and I don't know if that's where it kicks in

00:03:17.693 --> 00:03:24.570
that you get mad and, and that I'm aggressive in that way. I, I don't know why,

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.778
why that feeling comes over me. But it definitely scares me to the fact that I,

00:03:29.778 --> 00:03:34.260
I don't want to hurt anybody. Definitely don't want to hurt my wife and I hope

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.582
it never comes to that. I mean, I even have a little one now, and that's

00:03:38.582 --> 00:03:43.188
definitely one thing that terrifies me. If I was to go running out of the room

00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:48.534
or something, and God forbid, I, I had something happen to her. And that's one

00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:52.502
thing that's always in the back of my mind is you know, I'm kind of, I'm, I'm

00:03:52.502 --> 00:03:56.995
bigger guy and what would happen if that happened.

00:03:56.995 --> 00:03:59.875
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now, is there anything that you want people to know about night terrors?

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:02.668
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The worst thing you can do and, and people that have been around me and

00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:05.608
experienced it, the worst thing you can do is to go along with the person,

00:04:05.608 --> 00:04:11.430
talking to them, and trying to figure out what's going on. the person will seem

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.462
coherent, like their eyes will be open, I'll have a full-blown conversation

00:04:15.462 --> 00:04:19.116
with somebody, but I'm, I'm sleeping and I don't know what I'm going to do

00:04:19.116 --> 00:04:25.214
next, I have no idea. I have no control of this situation. That, what has

00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:29.368
control over me is whatever I'm picturing, whether it's spiders, snakes,

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:35.745
whatever that, that's what has control. Not me, the, the situation. If you know

00:04:35.745 --> 00:04:38.400
somebody that has it, if it's a family member, somebody that's going to be

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.235
around all the time, try to keep the door open, maybe have like a little night

00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:45.826
light out in the hallway or something. I know it sounds kind of silly if you

00:04:45.826 --> 00:04:48.751
have like like for me, I was a teenager, you know, put a night light, what are

00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:53.161
you talking about? But looking back on it, it would have probably been the best

00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:56.137
thing for my, my dad and, and people trying to help me out because they could

00:04:56.137 --> 00:04:59.065
see me, it was so dark all the time, I'd go sprinting out of the room and they

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:05.658
don't know where I'm at, like you can't see anything. So it's little things

00:05:05.658 --> 00:05:10.522
like that, that could help me out. And I don't know, as far as releasing my

00:05:10.522 --> 00:05:16.211
stress somehow, kind of kept to myself. I don't know if I, I talked enough to

00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:21.480
people to learn how to cope with stress differently. And I think that's what

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.597
ended happening is I got into the habit of not telling anybody anything. And

00:05:25.597 --> 00:05:30.815
that was my way of coping, was going to sleep and thinking about it. So I don't

00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:35.129
know if there's other avenues that way, I just haven't figured it out yet.
