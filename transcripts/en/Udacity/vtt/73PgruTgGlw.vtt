00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.986
The y intercepts would be 0 comma 3 and 0 comma negative 3. Great work if you

00:00:05.986 --> 00:00:11.806
got those two correct. We know for y intercepts we need to let x equal 0. So we

00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:17.395
set the value for x equal to 0, and then we solve for y. 0 squared is simply 0,

00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:23.655
so this fraction with the 0 in the numerator simplifies to 0. Then we'll just

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:28.926
have the rest of our equation. Y squared divided 9 equals 1. We'll multiply

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:33.714
both sides of the equation by 9 to get y squared equals 9. And then we'll take

00:00:33.714 --> 00:00:37.554
the square root of both sides using plus or minus to get 1 y is equal to plus

00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:42.914
or minus 3. Notice that we had a y squared term. This led us to have two

00:00:42.914 --> 00:00:50.053
solutions for y. We'll have positive 3 and negative 3. We use positive 3 for

00:00:50.053 --> 00:00:54.731
one of the y-coordinates, and negative 3 for the other y-coordinate. The

00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:57.218
x-coordinates are both 0.
