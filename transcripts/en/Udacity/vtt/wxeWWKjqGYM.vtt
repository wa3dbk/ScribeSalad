00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.019
It turns out we can always set up a proportion to solve direct and inverse

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.084
variation problems. Let's try this one out. For this problem the area of a

00:00:08.084 --> 00:00:13.166
circle varies directly with the square of it's radius. A circle with a side

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:18.370
length of 3 inches has an area of 28 and 278 thousandths inches squared. What is

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.774
the area of circle with a radius of 4 and 1 tenth inches? Now this problem is

00:00:22.774 --> 00:00:26.782
very similar to the last one we just did. Except you need to include on more

00:00:26.782 --> 00:00:30.350
thing. We're not just varying directly, we're varying directly with the square

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.820
of something. What do you think you're going to do? Try playing around with this

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.940
one and I hope you'll get it. Good luck. Also you don't want to round while you

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.562
solve the problem. When you find the final answer, round your answer to the

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:46.342
nearest thousandth. And again, I've already included the unit here of inches

00:00:46.342 --> 00:00:48.613
squared, so just write in your area here.
