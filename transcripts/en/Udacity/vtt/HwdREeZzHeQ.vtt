00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.028
We've seen how adding just simple color textures can vastly improve the look of

00:00:03.028 --> 00:00:07.255
a model. GPUs are very much optimized to access textures having considerable

00:00:07.255 --> 00:00:12.175
numbers of transistors dedicated to just this task. This in turn has led to a

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:15.954
huge number of uses for textures. The idea of applying two or more textures has

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:20.154
any number of other uses. For example, a surface can be made visually rich by

00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:23.162
giving it textures that add scratches, decals, planetary cloud cover or any

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:27.480
number of other phenomena. Multiple textures can be combined by addition,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.304
multiplication or other operations and all affect the same attribute. Mirror

00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:35.120
reflection can be done by rendering from a different angle and then using the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.447
reflected image as a texture used at each pixel. This is a whole huge sub

00:00:39.447 --> 00:00:42.027
category where a scene is rendered, and then its resulting image is post

00:00:42.027 --> 00:00:45.880
processed in various ways. We'll talk a bit more about these when we get into

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.346
shader programming. Because three.js is a web component, it can interact in

00:00:50.346 --> 00:00:54.520
interesting ways with other data. For example, you can take a video and use it

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.223
as a texture. This texture can then be placed on multiple moving screens as

00:00:58.223 --> 00:01:01.768
shown in this demo. Now that you know the basics of texture mapping, you're

00:01:01.768 --> 00:01:04.840
equipped to go ahead and dig into other people's demos and see what makes them

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.187
tick. Better yet, you can not try out some of your own effects. Texturing is a

00:01:09.187 --> 00:01:12.250
powerful tool and I look forward to seeing what you do with it.
