00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.120
For this module,

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.080
you'll want to open up the playground
file entitled Lesson1_Strings.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.180
And then of course, you'll want to check
in your Editor's menu that down here at

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.310
the second to the last item says,
Show Raw Markup.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.930
If you see a bunch of green comments,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.480
you're going to want to
click Show Rendered Markup.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.750
There's a lot of fun to be
had playing the strings and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.640
Swift strings are no exception.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.280
Earlier, you saw strings
defined as string literals.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.150
And you also saw Swift
style string concatenation.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.593
Because Swift string class is
built from Unicode scalar values,

00:00:34.593 --> 00:00:37.918
one can type emoji directly into
string literals, like this.

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:47.322
Oh yeah, to bring up the emoji keyboard
like that, I do control, command,

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:47.990
space bar.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.290
And then I can choose the heart.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.620
Another time saving feature of
Swift strings is support for

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.710
string interpolation.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.730
In other words,
inserting values of variables and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.550
expressions directly
into string literals.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.429
Let's say we have a statement about how
much a particular dog eats per month.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.450
And remember you can
always see the result of

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.200
the executed code over
here in the sidebar.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.530
Now let's say instead of Lulu
we want to know how much Ferris

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.770
the Springerdoodle eats per month.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.790
Here I've declared
dogName as a variable and

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.690
then I've inserted it into my string.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.770
And over here on the right you can see
that the string evaluates to Ferris eats

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.570
25 pounds of dog food per month.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.930
We can add expressions
to our string as well.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.680
Let's say we're really only paying
attention to how much Ferris

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.500
eats per day.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.130
This monthly consumption rate
can actually be evaluated as

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.720
the string is built.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.150
And of course, I do that by typing
backslash, and then parentheses.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.020
And then between the parentheses,
I put the expression I want to evaluate.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.899
So pounds per day, Times days per month.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.960
And again, you can see
the output hasn't changed much.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.770
Now our doggie diet string
is much more customizable.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.810
For example if we want to calculate the
pounds per month eaten by little Frankie

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.380
here, all we have to do is change
the value of pounds per day.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.320
Reassigned the dog named variable and
then re-evaluate our doggie diet string.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.790
And then over here we can

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.190
see that little Frankie eats 7.5
pounds of dog food per month.
