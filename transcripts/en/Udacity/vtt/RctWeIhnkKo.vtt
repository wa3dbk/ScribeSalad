00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.240
The introduction of Machine Learning
as an EMR technology is I think,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.620
potentially a key development.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.170
If EMR's are to adapt to physicians,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.330
they must have some
understanding of what they do.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.730
To explore that further,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.640
we'll now turn to a second commercial
EMR, Praxis by Infor-Med Corporation.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.440
PRAXIS using machine learning and
each physician user trains it

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.460
as they see the common
problems in their practice.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.720
Which it identifies based on the
physicians entry of the clinical finding

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.490
most specific for each problem.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.090
Over time PRAXIS learned how that
physician usually treats each problem

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.080
and as shown here.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.460
Presents a note based on
the most similar past patients.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.980
Each phrase is what Praxis
calls a clinical concept.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.210
But these are not encoded into
SNOMED CT or any other data standard.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.520
They are text descriptions as
defined by each physician.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.160
To avoid the erroneous default
value problem we discussed earlier.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.830
The physician must click on each
clinical concept to confirm

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.400
and, or edited.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.530
This one has been clicked on and the
physician can then edit the number of

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.690
days to whatever is appropriate for
that patient.
