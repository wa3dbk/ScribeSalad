click on the car class and here they are, pick the second one. Now let's supply

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:18.370
both parameters. And here is our car. The other constructor. Only requires one

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.460
parameter, and we get a car with a default image. Now I'll turn it over to

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.070
Sarah so you can practice writing constructors for the person class.
