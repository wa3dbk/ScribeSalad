00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.840
Now that we have our tile sets parsed, we need a way to find the image and

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.247
coordinate position of a specific tile in a tile set from our data array. Now to

00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:12.686
do this, we're going to have to create a new function called getTilePacket. That

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:16.910
takes the index value we want from the data array of a layer, and determines an

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.389
object like you see here. With the parameters of image set to the atlas image,

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:25.533
and then px and py set to the x index and y index of the tile in the atlas. To

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.953
grab the specific tile we want, we first need to lewd through all of the atlases

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:34.198
in the tile sets array, checking the first GID of each one. If our first GID

00:00:34.198 --> 00:00:38.218
parameter is less than or equal to the tile index that we're given in this

00:00:38.218 --> 00:00:42.697
function, then we know that the tile we're looking for exists in that tile set.

00:00:42.697 --> 00:00:46.357
Once we have the correct tile set, we can grab the tile set image, and compute

00:00:46.357 --> 00:00:50.023
the necessary offset for the specific tile we want. Based on first GID, the

00:00:50.023 --> 00:00:53.805
number of tiles for across and down, and the size of the individual tile. This

00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:56.873
should be some easy math to determine the x and y value you need.
