00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.162
So I have been talking about compile time errors as the big thing that static

00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:06.912
typing gives you. Let me explain what that means. So when we run a Python

00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:10.389
program, well we write the program we feed it as imput into the Python

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.476
interpreter and the Python interpreter runs the program, jumps around our code

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:18.562
and if at some point we get a type error the program will crash. With a staticly

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:23.010
type language like Java, things are quite different. You write a Java program

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.710
instead of running that right away, you feed that into what's called a Compiler.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.628
This is the program that takes the Java program, produces a Compiled program. In

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:35.016
the case of Java that's called Java by codes. It's called different things for

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:39.076
different language. But the other thing the Compiler does, is it looks at the

00:00:39.076 --> 00:00:44.526
entire program. So it's reading an entire program in. If there's anywhere in the

00:00:44.526 --> 00:00:49.052
code for that program, there's a type error, it's going to give a compile time

00:00:49.052 --> 00:00:52.965
type error. That means it'll stop, it'll warn the programmer something's wrong

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:56.860
with their program, go fix it. You can't even run the program even if maybe that

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.220
type error is somewhere in the code on all the executions you actually do. You

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.239
would never actually encounter, if there aren't any type errors if the programs

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.140
okay the compiler outputs a compiled program which then is input into the java

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.064
interpreter and that's what runs the code. At the point where the codes running

00:01:13.064 --> 00:01:16.704
we know that there aren't any type errors in it because the compiler would have

00:01:16.704 --> 00:01:20.400
caught them and stopped the program from even producing a compiled program and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.701
even being able to run in the first place. So that means with a statically typed

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:28.635
language like Java, we're getting them before we even run the program. With a

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:32.285
dynamically typed language like Python, we're getting our errors later. We're

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:36.363
not getting them until we encounter that part of the program in an execution.
