00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so here we are. Here's my version of the solution.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We take in day from the user.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
First thing we need to do is we need to check if day is a number or not.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Remember everything we get from--we get in our web app is going to be strings.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
HTTP and our web app doesn't know whether the user is typing in numbers

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or strings or whatever, so we get all strings, and we have to make sure

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
our string is made up of digits.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That's what the isdigit function does before we convert it to an integer,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which is what the int type does here when we call it as a function.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So now day, here, will be an integer, and if it's between 0 and--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
if it's greater than 0 and less than or equal to 31, we return it.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You can see down here, I've run it on 25, and we got 25.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Let's try some of the error cases. I'll try 0.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We'll run that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Our function returns none, which is what we expected.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If I type in 'foo', one of our test strings--we'll run that.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We get none again.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Let's try a correct date again--31. We'll run that.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Okay, all is well.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now, we could have made this more complicated by also taking the month,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and then making sure that February has only 28 days and March has 31

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and that sort of thing, but we don't need to make this too complicated.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm not trying to quiz you on calendars. I'm just trying to quiz you on writing basic functions.
