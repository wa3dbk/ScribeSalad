00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.998
So getting back to the point, now that we have the physics engine executing a

00:00:02.998 --> 00:00:06.932
callback, we need to define the callbacks somewhere. Now for our purposes,

00:00:06.932 --> 00:00:10.405
we're going to let game engine define the collision callback structure. Now in

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:14.451
the post solve collision function, we're given body A and body B. The next step

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:17.562
for you is to call the associate get user data function from these objects

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:21.220
getting the variable to the entity that created them
