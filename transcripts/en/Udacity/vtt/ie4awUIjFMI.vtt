00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
So it turns out doing this conversion is actually very straightforward.

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.584
All we're going to do is flip these 2 lines around, okay?

00:00:06.584 --> 00:00:11.445
If we interchange these 2 lines, then we've turned this scan from inclusive to exclusive.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.437
And why is this the case?

00:00:13.437 --> 00:00:17.127
So if we remember, an inclusive scan sums up all the elements,

00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:20.847
including the current element, and then writes its output.

00:00:20.847 --> 00:00:23.701
Instead, we want to convert this to an exclusive scan,

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.373
which is going to sum up all of the elements except for the current element,

00:00:26.373 --> 00:00:28.142
and then set the output.

00:00:28.142 --> 00:00:30.655
So what we do in the inclusive code that we see here

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:34.061
is first we apply the current element and then output the result.

00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:39.025
But for an exclusive scan, we will output the result and then apply the current element.

00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:42.085
So it's a very simple transformation to go from one to the next.
