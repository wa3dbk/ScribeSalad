Building little demos is fun and

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.590
all, but building a real game
is a whole different beast.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.689
It's like assembling a fine watch,
there's so

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.160
many moving pieces to keep track of, and
integrate, and so many interactions have

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.710
to be frictionless,
lest the whole thing grind to a halt.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.670
And guess what?

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.630
You've done it.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.980
You've brought Gigigal to life in all
her platform jumping, cannon shooting,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.780
robot destroying glory.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.080
I can't wait to see how you choose
to extend what we've built here.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.250
Will you add a level select screen,
add new types of enemies,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.130
add different types of
weapons maybe a boss battle?

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.060
The possibilities are as endless as
your imagination now that you've

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.840
got the skills to bring
your ideas to life.
