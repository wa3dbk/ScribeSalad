00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.540
So, when I decided to take a look at what websites had

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.160
a slow layout. I came to nbcnews.com. This website has different stories

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.040
laid out in sort of a grid on the screen. Let's see

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.370
what happens if we change the size of the grid. And, we

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.700
can see that the stories, instead of being stacked next to each

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.070
other are now stacked on top of each other. Let's make this

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.990
full screen again. And, we can see that the stories moved out

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.160
to their original horizontal orientation. Let's take a look at what this

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.670
looks like in Dev Tools. I'll Cmd+Option+i to open up

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.600
dev tools. Alright, where I have the HTML, let's go

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.230
over to the timeline. And, I'm going to hit the record

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.950
button, and start changing the size of the screen and watching

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.830
what happens with layout. We'll make it small. Okay, it

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.010
looks like the stories have moved. Let me go ahead

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.110
and make it full screen again. Cool. And, I can

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.160
go ahead and stop the recording. Alright. So, we have quite

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.950
a bit of data here in the timeline. I'm not

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.820
sure what we exactly we need to look at, so let's

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.660
go ahead, well instead of searching through, just filter out

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.100
what we don't want. Layout happens in Rendering, so let's get

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.090
rid of Painting, Scripting and Loading. We only see these

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.850
purple events here. Let's go ahead and take a look at

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.670
this section, we can see a few Layout events. Clicking

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.600
on this one we can see that it took 113 milliseconds,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.440
which is definitely a noticeable amount of time.
