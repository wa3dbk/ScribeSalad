00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300
If you play around with this a little bit further, you can figure out a general rule here,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:15.300
and the general rule is that if you have n vertices then the number of different paths from A to B

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.340
is two to the power of n half minus one.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.260
And the way you can see that this formula is correct is you can plug in the four here

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.360
so it's four over two which is two minus one and 2¹ that is two.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.090
And in the quiz, we just saw that each time we add two vertices here, we have to multiply by 2,

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.270
and this is exactly what happens here because if we add two vertices here

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.370
then the exponent here will increase by one.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.270
And in this way, you can work your way up to larger and larger networks of this structure.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.090
So what you can see here is that the number of ways to get from A to B

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.360
grows exponentially as these graphs here get more and more vertices.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.370
And I'm now going to ask in algorithmic question, and the algorithmic question is a very simple one

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.470
and that is what is the fastest way to get from A to B or the shortest way to get from A to B.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.140
And if you have had an algorithm's class, you might know that this is a problem

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.530
that can be solved in polynomial time.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.270
So there are many algorithms actually that can figure out in polynomial time.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.560
What the shortest way is to get from A to B?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.000
But this means that having many possible solutions cannot mean intractability

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.630
because here's the case where we do have many possible solutions.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.360
There are exponentially many ways to get from A to B,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.240
but if we ask an algorithm to figure out the shortest one for us,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.480
it does obviously not have to consider an exponential number of solutions

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.320
to come up with the answer because, otherwise, there would be no polynomial time algorithm

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.370
to figure out shortest paths between two points A and B.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.360
And so for vertex cover, clique, and independent set, this means that

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.410
if we want to show these problems to be intractable, it's not enough to point out

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.480
that there's an exponential number of solutions because that does not mean

00:02:05.480 --> 99:59:59.000
that there can't be no polynomial time algorithm.
