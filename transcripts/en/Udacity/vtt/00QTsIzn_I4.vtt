00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.170
Now in this course so far, we've seen a ton of different equations involving two

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.932
variables. Things for example like y equals 3x plus 2. Now equations in two

00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:14.156
variables can express input and output, causing effect or some sort of other

00:00:14.156 --> 00:00:18.644
relationship involving dependence. The note seemed like the two variables in the

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:22.730
equation would each play a different role. Perhaps it's that one of these two

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.764
variables needs to depend on the other. Now just like in this equation right

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:30.860
here, a lot of the other equations we've seen at different parts of the class,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.019
have been written in the same form. As y equals some sort of expression

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.037
involving x. We saw that we could write quadratics in this form too. And there

00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:44.384
were a lot of situations in which isolating y by itself on one side was really

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:48.863
conveinent for solving for different quantites. Now those equations were all

00:00:48.863 --> 00:00:52.896
written in the form y equals some expression where x is the variable. And if we

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:56.666
have an equation that's written in this form, which of these three statements

00:00:56.666 --> 00:01:01.470
down here do you think is implied? In an equation like this does x depend on y?

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.369
Does y depend on x? Or, is there no relationship of dependence between x and y?

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.926
In other words, does one of these two quantities help determine the value of the

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:12.553
other one?
