00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.591
These are the cerebral hemispheres. They may look similar. But our hemispheres

00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:09.818
differ in size, shape and function. Thus even though the cerebrum is divided

00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:13.998
into two equal hemispheres. We now know that the left hemisphere processes

00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:18.529
information in a focused and analytical manner. And the right hemisphere

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.068
intergrates information in a more broad manner. We see that insights and

00:00:23.068 --> 00:00:28.062
solutions to ideas are more likely to occur in the right hemisphere. However,

00:00:28.062 --> 00:00:32.205
the hemispheres do not operate independently. Let's look inside so I can show

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:37.098
you why this is. Here we have the Corpus Collosum. This is a thick band of

00:00:37.098 --> 00:00:41.002
fibers that connects the two hemispheres and this band allows for extensive

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:47.100
communication between the two hemispheres. This is really important for things

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.499
such as logical thinking, even creativity. From research we know that the

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.910
biggest functional difference between the two cerebral hemispheres is language.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.362
Both speech and language abilities involve the left hemisphere. However, they

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:05.546
involve different parts. The first neural scientist to discover this was a man

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:10.215
named Paul Broca. He found that a man who had a stroke could understand

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:15.032
language but could not speak grammatically correct sentences. This man had what

00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:18.512
we call Aphasia, which is a deficit in the ability to speak or comprehend

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:23.550
language. Due to his research, the part of the brain that's responsible for our

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.966
ability to actually produce speech. Is named the Broca's Area. The part of the

00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:34.664
brain that's responsible for the ability to speak in meaningful sentences. And

00:01:34.664 --> 00:01:38.930
to comprehend the meaning of speech, is named the Wernicke's Area. It was

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.255
discovered by Karl Wernicke. If there's damage to this area, the type of

00:01:43.255 --> 00:01:48.010
aphasia that results from this is fluent, grammatical streams of speech.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.880
However, they have no meaning. So, they're grammatically correct. They just

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.713
don't have any meaning to them.
