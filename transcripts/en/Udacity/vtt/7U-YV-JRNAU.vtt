00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Another quiz about parsing charts, although the hint for this one is to think about the closure.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I've written a grammar on the left. It's like the E plus E E minus a grammar, but this time,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we're using multiplication and division instead for no adequately explored reason.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We're currently looking at a state in chart 2.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Looks like this, E goes to E times, here's where we are,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and then another E coming from chart state zero.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What I'd like you to do is indicate which of these other states would have to be included in chart 2.

00:00:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That is, let's say we bring in closure from this parse state. What else we are going to bring in?
