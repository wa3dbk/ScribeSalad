00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.780
Through the class project, you'll investigate New York

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.870
City subway ridership as a data scientist might. First,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.850
you'll pull some publicly available data on subway ridership,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.440
and also on New York weather conditions, using the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.970
New York MTA website and the Weather Underground

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.110
API. Then, you'll answer some questions about subway ridership

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.810
using statistics and machine learning. Does the weather influence

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.650
how many people ride the subway? Is the subway

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.280
busier at certain times than others? Can we

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.950
predict subway ridership? Finally, you'll develop some charts

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.930
and graphics that communicate your findings, and synthesize

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.140
everything into a cohesive write-up that your friends

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.010
or family might find useful and informative. This

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.820
may sound daunting, but we'll be going through

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.810
this step by step, and learning how to use the necessary tools as we go along.
