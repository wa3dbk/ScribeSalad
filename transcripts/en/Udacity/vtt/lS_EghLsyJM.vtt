00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.350
But who's to say that you always have to work alone? What if you guys solved

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.524
the problems together? The amount of work you do in 1 hour plus the amount of

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:11.678
work Anthony does in 1 hour, would equal the total fraction of work you both

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:16.816
can do in 1 hour. In other words, we knew that you could complete half of the

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:21.288
job in 1 hour. And Anthony can complete a third of the job in 1 hour. So if we

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.808
add these 2 fractions together, this would be the total sum of the fraction of

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:29.852
the job that you both could do in 1 hour's time. Notice that the denominator

00:00:29.852 --> 00:00:34.946
here represents the time that it took for you do the entire job. And for

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:38.418
Anthony, the 3 represents the amount of time it took for him to do the entire

00:00:38.418 --> 00:00:43.288
job. This means that x represents the total number of hours for you and Anthony

00:00:43.288 --> 00:00:48.164
to do that job together. So working together, how long would it actually take

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:52.028
you and Anthony to complete the assignment together? Write the number of hours

00:00:52.028 --> 00:00:55.797
it would take them to complete the work together here. And then convert that

00:00:55.797 --> 00:00:59.800
answer to the number of minutes it would take them to complete the work here.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.925
Keep in mind I don't want you to write your answer as hours and minutes. I want

00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:06.792
you to write the fraction or the number of hours here and then convert that

00:01:06.792 --> 00:01:09.730
fraction to the toal number of minutes here.
