00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.462
Here's our answer. Great work if you got that one correct. We can factor the

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:09.525
numerator to be x plus 3 times x minus 3, since this is the difference of two

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:14.260
squares. Our denominator factors into x plus 3 squared. This is a perfect square

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.949
trinomial. The first term is a square. The second term is a square, and the

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.250
middle terms is twice the square root of the first term and the last term. We

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.118
know for the square exponent, we really write this factor twice. From here, it's

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:29.880
easy to see we have a common factor of x plus 3, in the numerator and the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.298
denominator. So those simplify to equal 1. Another way to think about

00:00:34.298 --> 00:00:38.800
simplifying this is to do it over here. We have an exponent of 1 for this x plus

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.490
3. An exponent of 2 for this x plus 3. We use one of these x plus 3s to cancel

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.960
with the 1 and the numerator. So our power of 2 drops down to a power of 1 and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.257
we lose this factor altogether. Keep in mind that things aren't equal in 0 here,

00:00:54.257 --> 00:00:59.584
it's really that we have an equivalence of 1, x plus 3 divided by x plus 3. This

00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:01.933
leaves us with our final answer.
