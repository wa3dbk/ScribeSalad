00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.940
We want to figure out what the sum of all of the numbers that are entered is.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.245
And also what the count is. So, we can use them to calculate the average and

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:11.316
return it. We can use a do loop to collect the user input. Somewhere in the do

00:00:11.316 --> 00:00:15.414
loop we'll have to update value by getting the next user input. So, we'll need

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:18.378
to ask the user for a double, and then read in the next double using the

00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:22.700
scanner. If the value is 0, then we want to quit, but if it's not, we want to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.080
increment count and add to the sum. So, count goes up, and sum goes up. So, how

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.180
long do we want to keep going? We want to keep going as long as value is not 0.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.581
Because if value is 0, that means we read a 0 from the user. So, we continue

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:44.232
doing these steps, as long as value is not 0. Let's try this, after I fix up my

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:50.772
syntax errors. Running the main method. If I enter 2, it doesn't quit. Negative

00:00:50.772 --> 00:00:55.238
3, it doesn't quit. 0, it stops. And it gives me an average. Let's look at the

00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:58.600
program again though. There's some repetition here. We have to check that the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.092
value is not equal to 0 in two different places. We could change this so

00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:06.936
instead of using a do while loop it would just use a while loop and only check

00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:12.875
the value as not equal to 0 in one place. We would declare a Boolean to track

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:17.092
whether we're done or not yet. Initially, we're not done. So, it starts as

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:20.854
false. Then, as long as we're not done, we would keep doing the things in the

00:01:20.854 --> 00:01:24.640
loop. So, we wouldn't need the while at the bottom. As is, this loop would go

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.180
forever because we never change the value of done. So, when do we want to say

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.520
that we're done? Well, we want to say that we're done if somebody puts in a 0.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.090
So, if the value is 0, then we set done to true. This will work the same way.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.810
When I run the main method, it'll ask for doubles until I enter 0, and then

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.029
give the average. You can structure any loop and a half this way using a

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:50.313
Boolean to guard your condition.
