00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.151
The last part of graphing an inequality is figuring our which region to shade.

00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:08.454
We could either shade this top region, region 1, or this lower region, region 2.

00:00:08.454 --> 00:00:12.452
One of these has to be correct. To figure it out, we can use a test point. We

00:00:12.452 --> 00:00:16.548
can choose any point in one of the regions to determine whether or not it makes

00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:21.503
the inequality true. I want to make sure I don't choose a point along this line.

00:00:21.503 --> 00:00:26.553
Because these points have been excluded. It's dashed. The origin is usually a

00:00:26.553 --> 00:00:31.494
great point to check. It's zeroes, and it's easy to plug in. So you check it,

00:00:31.494 --> 00:00:36.109
and determine. Should we shade region 1 or region 2? If 0,0 makes a true

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:41.225
statement here, we want region 2. If 0, 0 doesn't make a true statement in this

00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:43.585
inequality, then we want region 1.
