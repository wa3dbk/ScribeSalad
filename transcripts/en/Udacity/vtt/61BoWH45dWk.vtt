00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.500
Here, we're going to
talk about metacognition.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.000
Metacognition is thinking about
thinking, or knowing what you know.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.634
It's really any thought process,
where the target of the thought process,

00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:10.560
is actually inside you're own brain.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.660
So it might be thinking about
what you're thinking about,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.160
or knowing what knowledge that you have.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.352
Now, a key type of metacognition,
in learning, is called self-regulated

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:22.180
learning.-Self regulated learning is the
process by which a person plans out how

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.150
they're going to learn something,
monitors how learning is going,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.585
evaluates it, and
then adjusts it accordingly.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:30.850
Self-regulated learning is really
the goal that we want students to reach.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.210
We want them to become self-regulated
learners because it's more about

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.680
active learning rather
than passive learning.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.690
It's about driving your own learning
process as opposed to being a passive

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.640
consumer of whatever information
is presented to you.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.880
Now a key part of self-regulated
learning is the mindset that one has

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.000
towards learning.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.750
There are a lot of people out
there that think they have

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.660
a fixed amount of intelligence, that
they are as smart as they'll ever be,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.420
and if they can't do something it's
just because they aren't smart enough.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.930
That's not really an accurate
way of framing intelligence.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.920
Intelligence is much more something that
we can work at, we can grow through.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.090
Through effort and intensive study we
can actually get smarter, effectively.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.940
Now I think everybody has that one book
that they recommend that everybody read

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.200
and mine is actually on this topic.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.070
Carol Dweck is a Stanford psychologist
who spent decades working on motivation

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.870
and learning, especially at the lower,
middle and high school levels.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.800
And what she found was that ability
does not necessarily predict success at

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.880
the next level.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.940
But the mindset that one
has towards learning and

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.680
towards intelligence is really
the chief predictor at whether or

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.990
not someone will be
successful at the next level.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.350
She found that those people who
recognized that failure is just

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.590
an opportunity to learn, as opposed to
a referendum on one's own intelligence,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.970
are really the ones who
succeed at the next level.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.140
So I highly recommend picking
up this book, especially for

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.530
both designing educational
technology and for self-improvement.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.780
So in this lesson what we're going to
talk about is really how to use

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.290
technology to facilitate
metacognitive development.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.660
We'll talk about how technology can give
a kind of open-ended and self-driven

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.720
opportunities to students that would
be difficult in a regular classroom.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.430
Typically classrooms are driven
by a lesson and a lecture and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.240
it can be difficult to give students
the opportunity to drive what they're

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.030
learning In time.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.630
But through technology,
we can build more open-ended

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.600
environments in which the learner
is put into the driver's seat.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.440
And they get to control what they
learn and when, and how, and

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.140
learn at that process of monitoring it
and planning it, and evaluating it.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.210
So we'll talk about how technology
can really facilitate meta-cognative

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.750
development
