This comes from the saying that if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and

00:00:03.864 --> 00:00:07.774
quacks like a duck, then it is probably a duck. Python encourages this style,

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:11.470
it's a very dynamic way of programming. It means that we can dynamically add

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.836
attributes to classes and they'll take on these new behaviors and the code that

00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:18.748
uses them will still work. It doesn't matter how we create an instance as long

00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:22.476
as it has the operation we need when we need it. There are certain dangers to

00:00:22.476 --> 00:00:26.200
duck typing. Just because an object has a quack method, it doesn't mean it

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.140
necessarily does what we expect. Not all ducks quack. Some would say mak, mak,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.442
like they do in Romania.
