00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.430
The answer is that find will return negative one. When

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.000
the target string is not found in the search string.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.070
Of the four examples here there are two where that's

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.530
the case. For both of these, it is found, so

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.870
in the first example we're looking for t within the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.850
string test. It occurs in two places. But it'll find

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.840
the first one, so the result of this find will

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.110
be zero. For this one we're looking for the string st.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.050
Strings are the same whether they have single or double

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.100
quotes. It doesn't matter what we use, as long as we're

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.690
consistent with the first and the end quote. And in

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.090
this case we find the string st at position two, so

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.200
that would return two. For this one we used an

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.830
upper case t, a lower case here. The find has to

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.650
match exactly, it has to be the same character and case

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.490
matters. So this would return negative one, and would be correct

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.480
that this is one of the examples that returns

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.090
negative one. And for the final one, we're searching

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.790
for the string test, within the string west. They

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.560
don't match exactly; so this would also return negative one.
