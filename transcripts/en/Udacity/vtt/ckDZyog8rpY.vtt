00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.560
So let's see if we understood
the coherence definition.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.640
Let's say that we have two cores, in a
system that is supposed to be coherent.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.886
Let's say that core 1
executes this program.

00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:17.290
It sets A = 1, then waits for

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.760
A to change from 1, so it's going to
loop here as long as A == 1.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.650
Sets A again to 1, and
then prints done one.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.170
At the same time when core one is
started on this, core two starts on

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.340
another program that writes zero to
the same location A in shared memory,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.360
waits until a changes from zero, sets
A to zero again, then prints done two.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.030
And remember that core one and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.880
core two, need not necessarily execute
these two programs in lockstep.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.940
So it's not necessary that core one
executes this while core two does this,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.680
core one does this while
core two this and so on.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.260
It could be for example that core one

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.459
executes several of these while core
two is still not even beginning.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.830
So you can insert
arbitrary delays in between

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.080
any of the statements here and here.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.870
The question for you is which of
the following print outs are possible?

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.080
First, core one prints Done 1!,
then core two prints Done 2!.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.800
The next possibility,
first core two prints Done 2!,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.260
then core one prints Done 1!

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.720
The next option,
core one prints Done 1!,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.770
but core two gets stuck and
never gets to print Done 2!.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.860
The next option is
core one gets stuck and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.830
never gets to print Done 1!, but
core two successfully prints Done 2!.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.900
And the final option, is that
nothing is printed because both of

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.450
the cores gets stuck, so
neither of them prints anything ever.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.450
So which of these five
options are actually possible

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.490
when these two programs
run in a coherent system?
