Now, we can try this out in BlueJ. Let's make a new car object. Here it is.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.970
Let's drive the car for ten miles. Hm, that wasn't very exciting. It would be

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.570
nice if we could see the car. Let's do that. I'll put a picture in here, and

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.450
you'll see later how that picture is initialized. And in the drive method, I'll

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.880
move the picture by the distance trip. Now, let's make another car. You see the

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.930
picture. Let's drive it, and there it goes. And that was a little bit

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.310
disappointing, because it only moved by ten pixels. Let's fix that. Let's move

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.330
it by 10 times the distance, and actually let's do this right. Let's declare a

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.249
variable, and then use that variable. Now, when the car drives, then it shows

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.870
it nicely. Okay, now you have seen how to implement some instance methods. And

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.530
Sarah will walk you through that process with another example, with a person

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.790
class.
