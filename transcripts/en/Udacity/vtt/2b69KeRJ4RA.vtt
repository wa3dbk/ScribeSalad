00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.040
We have come across the notion of meta-reasoning earlier in this class.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.000
You may recall this was the explanation that an agent had built,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.160
to decide why a particular object was an instance of the cup.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.400
And we told it that it was an incorrect decision. The agent then,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.230
reflected on its knowledge. Here was the knowledge.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.560
Here was the explanation it had built. It is now reflecting on it and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.270
trying to figure out what makes this particular explanation incorrect.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.360
Where does the fault lie? That was an example where the agent was reflecting on

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.390
its knowledge, but has this knowledge was stored in the short term memory.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.020
It had been pulled out of the long term memory. But just like there can be

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.430
error in the knowledge, there could also potentially be an error in reasoning.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.400
Or potentially an error in the learning process. An example of an error in

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.270
reasoning occurred very early in this particular class. You may recall this

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.220
particular diagram from mean sense analysis. This was the blocks micro build.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.470
The agents needed to take the blocks from this initial stage to this goal state.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.850
However there were multiple goals here. D on table, C on D, B on C.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.300
And as the agent tried to accomplish these goals. It ran into cul de sacs,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.440
where no further progress was possible without undoing some of

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.130
the earlier goals. So, that was an example of metacognition over reasoning,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.230
where the agent was trying to figure out, what was the error in my reasoning,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.030
and how can I remedy it. We can similarly have metacognition over learning. So

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.460
an example of metacognition where learning occurred.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.910
When we were talking about learning making mistakes. You recall this was

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.250
the explanation the agent had built, after it had remedied the explanation.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.340
The remedy in this particular case was adding here that the handle is fixed and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.630
relating it to the rest of the explanation. Given that the agent had

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.300
used explanation based learning to build this explanation in the first place,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.890
we can think of the agent as, reflecting on this process of explanation based

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.530
learning and asking itself, what did I do wrong? And then deciding,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.808
well I built the wrong explanation. I must change that explanation. And

00:01:54.808 --> 00:01:58.230
that's what learning by correcting mistakes did. We can consider this to

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.860
be a process of metacognition of learning in the sense that the agent may say,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.760
how did I learn this particular knowledge. Well,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.730
they learned it through explanationless learning. So

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.240
what was wrong in my process of explanationless learning that lead to this

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.090
incorrect explanation? How do I fix my process of explanationless learning so

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.750
that I do not make the same error, again?
