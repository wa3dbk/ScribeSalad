00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The thing I want to do next is say let's just deal with a single row at a time.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's not worry about the rest of the row. Let's now worry about going in columns.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Just deal with one row but also have that row handle the cross letters--the cross words.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm going to need a representation for a row, and I think I'm going to make that be a list.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There are many possible choices, but a list is good.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I choose a list rather than a tuple, because I want to be able to change it in place.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I want to be able to modify the row as we go, as the game evolves.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Row is going to be a list of squares.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If the square is a letter, we'll just use that letter as the value of the square.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If the square is an empty spot which has nothing in it,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I think I'll use dot just to say nothing is there.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
A trick that you learn once you've done this kind of thing a lot of times,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is to say I'm going to be look at letters, I'm going to be looking at locations in the row,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm going to be looking at their adjacent letters and going to the right

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and going to the left.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If I'm trying to fill in from this anchor, I'll move to the left to put in the prefix

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and I'll move to the right to extend the word.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It seems to me like I'm always going to have to be making checks of saying

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
what's the next character, is it a letter, is it an anchor, what is it?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Also, oops, did I get past the end of the board.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It seems like I'm going to have to duplicate the amount of code I have to write to check

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
both the case when I go off the board and when I don't go off the board.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
One way to avoid that is to make sure you never go off the board.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It cuts the amount of code in half to some extent.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
A way to do that is to put in extra squares--

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to say here are the squares on the board, but let's make another extra square on each side

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and just fill that in say the value of what's in that square is a boarder,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
not a real square that you can play in, but if I'm here and I say what's the value of square

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
number i -1, I get an answer saying it's a border rather than getting an answer

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that's saying when you go i - 1 from position 0 you get an error.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I think I'll use a vertical bar to indicate a border.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'll have one there, and at the end of my row, I'll have another border.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now I've sort of got everything. I got borders, letters, empty squares.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The only thing left is anchors.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I think what I'll do here is I'll introduce a special type for anchor.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I could have used something like a tuple or a set of characters,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
but I want to make sure I know, and I want to have something in my code

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that says if the value of row[ i ] is an instance of anchor, then I want to do something.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So we'll make anchor be a class, and I want it to be a class that contains the set of letters.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I can do that in a very easy way.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I can use a class statement to say I'm going to define a new class.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
The class is called an anchor, and the class is a subset of the set class.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Then I don't need anything else for the definition of the class.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
All I have to know is that anchors are a type of set, but they're a particular type of set.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
They're a set of anchor letters. Here's a code for that.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I define a class of anchor. I have all of my allowable letters.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Then I say any is an anchor, which allows you to put any letter onto that anchor spot.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Now I want to represent this row where here are the borders, here are the empty spots,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and here are the particular letters, and this representation--

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
the schematic representation as a string does not account for a fact

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that after the A we're going to have

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
two restricted anchors that have to contain these characters.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So we'll define them--use the names mnx and moab to be the two anchors

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that are restricted to have only those letters.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Now our row is equal to the border square is element number 0.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Then the A is element number 1.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Then we have these two restricted anchors, two more empty spots,

00:03:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
another anchor where anything can go--the B and the E, and so on.
