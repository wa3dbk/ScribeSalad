00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.700
So let's just make
a little room here and

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.630
we'll copy this equation
down one more time.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.600
But this time what we're going to
do is instead of considering

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.830
this weighted combination of
the Q values at state S prime,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.530
weighted by the probability
of reaching S prime.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.140
Let's just make it simple and

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.860
just worry about the S prime
where the difference is largest.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.160
Since this is a weighted average,
or a convex combination,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.090
it can't be any larger than
the biggest difference at any S prime.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.560
So we're going to do that,
we're going to copy that down and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.990
max it over S primes.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.820
And we don't need to include
the max over a and S anymore,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.090
because you'll notice this expression
doesn't even have a and S in it anymore.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.140
So actually, by considering this kind
of worst case version we don't have to.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.100
We don't have that max anymore.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.320
&gt;&gt; And that gets us from
an equal to a less than an equal

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.520
&gt;&gt; This gets us from an equal to a less

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.600
than an equal that's right
because we're bounding it.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.730
It could actually be a bit wider here.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.470
We're considering the worst
possible next state in terms of

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.760
the difference between
these Q functions.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.810
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And now you can see that it's

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.740
actually getting pretty close
to where we want to end up.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.510
The main difference, in fact, let me
rewrite this max norm equation out.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.090
So when we write that out we get gamma
times the max over state action pairs.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.338
And I'm going to write s prime and

00:01:15.338 --> 00:01:18.150
a prime to make it easier to
match up with the other equation.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.710
It's however we're indexing
over the state action pairs

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.960
that make up Q1 and Q2.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.890
So this max norm is really just the max
over those of the difference between

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.710
the two Q functions, and
this is where we are at the moment.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.650
We have something like
gamma max over S prime, and

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.820
these maxes are trapped
in the absolute value.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.480
It would be really nice if we could move
these maxes out of the absolute value,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.140
and have it this way so
now the a primes actually match up.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.470
Here this is the max action
according to the Q function Q1 and

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.710
this is the max actions
according to Q function Q2 and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.788
it would good if we could just
talk about them together.

00:01:55.788 --> 00:02:00.160
So this is kind of to me anyway
this is the most fun most exciting

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.644
most interesting step because
this turns out to be true.

00:02:03.644 --> 00:02:08.530
[LAUGH] Right, that we can
actually move these maxes out, and

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.940
then we get a valid sequence.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.960
So I'm going to focus in
on this step in a moment.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.450
But let's just accept it for the time
being, that we can move these maxes out.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.250
Now we've actually completed
the algebra that we needed to complete.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.256
The difference between the two Q
functions after we apply the Bellman

00:02:24.256 --> 00:02:28.814
operator is actually less than or equal
to gamma, something smaller than 1,

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:32.420
times what the distance was
before we applied the Q operator.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.138
I'm sorry, the B operator of the
Bellman Operator of a value iteration.

00:02:40.138 --> 00:02:45.640
&gt;&gt; Wow, so Bellman and
value iteration converges,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.130
except for this magical step
you're about to explain to me.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.620
&gt;&gt; Except for the magical step, yeah.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.600
And the magic step is fun because it's,
I alternate between as seeing it as

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.640
completely obvious, and of course this
is true, and being completely mystified

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.730
and don't understand how
it could possibly be true.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.010
And my brain just sort of flips back and

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.450
forth between those kind of
like a Necker cube.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.830
So let's dive in and
make sure that this property holds,

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.650
knowing that once we establish
that we get the whole chain,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.050
we get the whole
contraction operator thing.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.690
We get all the power of
contraction operators

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.260
in when we're doing Bellman Optics.
