So, in fact, it's the introverts, because remember, they respond more to

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.250
stimulation than extroverts. And this is seen even in constriction of the eye,

to light. So this study confirms Eysenck's basic assumption and prediction that

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.946
there's a biological basis for introversion, extroversion and this includes

00:00:19.946 --> 00:00:22.890
sensory stimulation.
