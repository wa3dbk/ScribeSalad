00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.960
So, let's use these TimeUtils
tools to create simple movement.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.320
Just a ball moving around in a circle.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.450
The first thing we need to do, is set
up some constants that determine what

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.000
the movement of the ball looks like,
including how many

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.570
seconds the ball should take to
go all the way through one cycle.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.130
Then we need to store the time at which
the application adapter was created

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.970
by declaring a long called initialTime.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.180
And then setting equal
it to TimeUtils.nanoTime

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.750
in the create callback.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.480
Now, down in the renderer callback,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.890
we can figure out how long it's
been since the game started running

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.380
by subtracting the initial time from
the current value of TimeUtils.nanoTime.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.380
This gives the number of nanoseconds
that the game has been running.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.150
But seconds would be
a lot more convenient.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.890
LibGDX provides a very nice
MathUtils.nanoToSec constant

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.560
to help with that conversion.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.770
Now we need to figure out
where in the cycle we're at.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.650
If we take the elapsedSeconds and
divide it by the period,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.350
we get the number of elapsed periods
since the game started running.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.090
We can then take the modulis
with 1 to determine what

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.450
fractional part of a cycle has elapsed.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.770
So we now have a number that counts up
from 0 to 1 and then resets back to 0.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.840
And we need to map that interval
to a position on a circle.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.220
Don't suppose you remember
the parametric equation on a circle?

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.260
You can check out the link
in the instructor notes for

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.740
a short refresher on some trigonometry.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.305
To figure out the x
position of our ball,

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:25.907
we take the center point of the world,
and then we add the movement radius

00:01:25.907 --> 00:01:29.235
times the cosine of the cycle
position times two Pi.

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:30.889
For the y position
it's almost identical,

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:33.540
except we're taking the sine
instead of the cosine.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.970
And there we go,
we've achieved circular movement.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.950
Even with something so
simple as balls moving in circles,

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.670
we can make some surprisingly
beautiful patterns.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.074
Check out what we can do with 20 balls,

00:01:45.074 --> 00:01:47.709
each moving at a different
harmonic speed.

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.119
