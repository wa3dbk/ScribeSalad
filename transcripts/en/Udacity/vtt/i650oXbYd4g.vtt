00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now I want to describe a family of strategies that I'm calling hold at n,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
where n is an integer.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For example, hold at 20 is a strategy that keeps on rolling

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
until the pending score is greater than or equal to 20, and then it holds.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The point of this strategy is you get points by rolling,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but you risk points by rolling as well.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The higher the pending score is, the more you're risking.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So there should be some point at which you're saying that's too much of a risk.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I've accumulated so much pending that I don't want to risk any more,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and then I'm going to hold.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So hold at 10, hold at 20, hold at 30 describes that family of strategies.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I should say there's one subtlety here that we'll build in to hold at,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
which is let's say that the goal is 50,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and my score when I start my round is say 40.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Then let's say I roll a 6 and a 4.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
According to hold at 20 I should keep on rolling because my pending score is only 10.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I haven't gotten up to 20 yet, but it would be silly for me to keep rolling at that point.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I would risk pigging out and only scoring one point and getting to 41.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Whereas I know if I hold now I have 40 + 6 + 4 is 50.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I've already won the game.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So, hold at 20 will hold when pending is greater than or equal to 20,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
or when you win by holding.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So, I want you to go ahead and implement that.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Since hold at x is a whole family of strategy of functions,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
hold at x is not going to be a strategy function.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Rather, it's going to return a strategy function.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So I've given you this outline of saying we're going to define a strategy function,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
then we're going to fix up it's name a little bit to describe it better.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Then we're going to return it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You have to write the code within the strategy function.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I should say, we're going to stick with the representations of states,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
where state is a four tuple of the player to move, zero one,

00:02:04.000 --> 09:59:59.000
me and you score, and the pending score.
