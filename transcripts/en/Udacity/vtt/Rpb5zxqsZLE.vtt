00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.390
The success or failure of the models that you create

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.870
is in a very large part determined by essentially what

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.070
are you paying attention to about your data. So, this

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.100
is the problem called feature selection. And I think that not

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.520
enough time is spent in doing this. It's very, very

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.410
important so it's, in a lot of data science shops,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.210
it's very easy to just sort of take, records that

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.830
come in, and then put them into a logistic regression, and

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.660
you get some output, and then like, you can

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.960
call it a day. and, you know, maybe often

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.570
times that could be enough to take you, like,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.210
you know, 50% of the way there. But really

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.360
the difference between, like, a mediocre and a top-notch

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.440
shop, is like you have sat and thought about

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.730
what are the things to pay attention to? Like

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.850
should I synthesize these features into a new feature?

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.690
Is there something new about this phenomenon that I

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.410
should be capturing but haven't yet, haven't yet captured? So

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.100
there's a lot of sort of there's a lot of

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.750
process that goes into, just the feature selection process which

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.540
is, is hugely important. More advice, which just occurred to

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.310
me, is there's an additional, there's a world of tools

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.950
out there that are not merely limited. so, so everything

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.460
you would learn in the machine learning class is fantastic.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.130
It forms a great foundation. Beyond there, there's

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.140
a wealth of mathematical tools, and the more of

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.650
them that you know, the more that it

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.200
will help you. So things, for example, like differential

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.500
equations, or stochastic processes such as Markov chains.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.870
Knowledge of these things allow you to break down

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.650
a problem that you know nothing about. You

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.430
can sort of break it down a little bit,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.260
a little bit further into pieces that give you

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.740
just that extra bit of predictive ability or or insight

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.450
into a problem. And the more tools that you

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.150
have at your disposal the more it will help you.
