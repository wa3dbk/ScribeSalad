00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.920
One easy transformation we
can do is a circular review.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.800
We'll cover other elements
of meaningful motion

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.280
in more detail later in the course,
so let's consider this a preview.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.760
In this app, clicking one of
the recycler view items will kick off

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.100
a circular review transition
to new item texts.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.670
The circular reveal effect is
used a lot in material design and

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.119
ties in nicely with ripples.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.530
So let's talk a little bit

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.280
about how we're going to
make this circular reveal.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.240
This is the signature of
the createCircularReveal function.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.925
The view we're going to operate on,
a center X and

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:41.370
Y to start the transition,
a startRadius, and an endRadius.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.440
So let's say this is the view group
holding the text we want to change.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.080
First we need to find
the center point of our reveal.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.600
We can do that by taking the item's
width and height and dividing in half.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.640
The reveal should start from nothing,
so our starting radius is zero.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.720
You might remember from geometry class
that the diameter is a line segment that

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.580
passes through the center and
whose end points lie on the circle.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.510
The radius is half of the diameter.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.010
So if we fit our item to a circle, and
situate the center points here to line

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.910
up, our ending radius would be
from about here to here, or

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.400
a little bit more than half
the width of the item.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.550
One reason why it would
be a little bit more,

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.480
is just because if it's a square item,
it's not going to

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.570
perfectly align with a circle, so
you would need to adjust that.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.610
So now we have all the pieces we
need to create a circular reveal.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.360
As I mentioned before, you couldn't
just use half of the width of the item.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.510
You actually need to use the hypotenuse
of half the width and half the height.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.340
And here are all the components
of the createCircularReveal

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.410
function that create our animator.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.850
After that set,
we chang the text, and the title,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.750
along with the background color.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.410
Lastly, we start the animation
