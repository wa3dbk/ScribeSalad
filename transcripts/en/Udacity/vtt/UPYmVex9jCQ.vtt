00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.570
There are a couple of different solutions for this,

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.000
but all of these solutions will have in common that you need at least

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.060
4 monitoring devices to monitor the whole network,

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.520
and I will show you one of these solutions.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.030
So you could install one here, which would monitor these cables here.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.070
You could install one here to monitor these cables,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.700
and then you need one here, or you could have one here.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.230
There are other possibilities, as I said, to monitor these 2 cables here.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.420
And then finally, you can install one here to monitor these 2.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.590
So this is one solution where you use 4 monitoring devices

00:00:29.590 --> 99:59:59.000
to monitor the whole network, and it's not possible with 3.
