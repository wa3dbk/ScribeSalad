00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And the answer is 1. The mean of x is 2, the mean of y is 3, b=1 3-2 makes 1.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So we've recovered using these formulas, but we kind of already knew about the data,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
mainly that y is x+1--that is a=1 and b=1

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
because there's exactly 1x over here in this equation, so let's make this more complicated.
