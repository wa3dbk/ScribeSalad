00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.065
So now that Susan explained classical conditioning, let's look back to when I

00:00:03.065 --> 00:00:07.290
classically conditioned Greg, and identify the parts of classical conditioning.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.490
Let's start here. Here I am with the bell. The bell originally didn't produce

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.175
any significant

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:11.435
[SOUND]

00:00:11.435 --> 00:00:14.919
response from Greg, other than maybe looking around. So what's the original

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.320
term we would give to the bell in this situation? Is it the unconditioned

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.286
stimulus? Is it the unconditional response, is it the conditioned response, or

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:25.650
is it the neutral stimulus?
