So you may be wondering how is that people who grow up in the same family can

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:08.010
grow up in different environments? Well, birth order is one way this can

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.342
happen. And by birth order we just simply mean whether you're first child or

00:00:11.342 --> 00:00:16.985
second child or fourth child or whatever. Now birth order really can affect our

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:21.702
personalities. In general, the evidence suggests that first born children, for

00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:26.439
example, tend to be more conservative. They tend to be more responsible. And

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.947
they tend to have a higher self esteem. And then latter born children, people

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:34.485
second, and third, and fourth, and so on tend to be more rebellious and

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:39.869
challenge the status quo. In fact, the psychologist Frank Sulloway wrote a book

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:44.570
called, Born to Rebel and it was all about birth order. And he studied the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.600
history of science and politics and the reason he chose these two areas was

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.410
because they have revolutions pretty regularly. New ideas come on and he wanted

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.190
to see who accepted and who rejected these new revolutionary ideas and as it

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.090
turns out, the best predictor of who accepted and rejected these new ideas was

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.168
birth order. First born children tended to reject new ideas in science and

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:14.474
politics. And latter born children tended to accept them. So birth order really

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.310
does affect our personalities.
