00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.530
Okay, Michael, so let's, let's look at this little line

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.340
segment, okay? And then say I've got ten little points that

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.580
I could put down on this line segment, and I want

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.850
them all to represent some part of this line, alright? That's

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.590
kind of K nearest neighbor-y/-ish. So, I'm going to put a little

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.670
X here, I'll put one here, I'll put one here, put

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.024
one here, put one here, here, here, here, here, here. Is

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:25.790
that ten? Three... six. Nine, ten. Ten. Okay. And let's pretend

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.060
I did the right thing here and I have them

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.870
kind of uniformly distributed across the line segment. So that means

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.340
each one of these points is sort of owning, an

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.190
equal size sub segment of this segment. Does that make sense?

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, so it's representing it in the sense that, that point. Uh,when

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.110
you're trying to estimate values of other places on the line it's going to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.700
default as the nearest neighbor to being

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.360
that point so there's a very small little

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.730
neighborhood of the red line segment that is covered by each of the green X's.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.320
&gt;&gt; That is exactly right and in fact each one

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.440
of these green X's represents. How much of this segment?

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.650
&gt;&gt; Each of the green X's covers one tenth?

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.960
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. You cover one tenth. Alright

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.220
Michael, so let's say I move from a line

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.560
segment now to a two dimensional space. So

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.230
a little square segment. If that's the right

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.850
technical term. And I've taken my little ten

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.890
x's, and I put them down here before. Well,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.960
here's something you'll notice; you'll notice that each

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.850
one of these x's is going to still end

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.410
up representing one-tenth of all of this space,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.418
but you'll also notice that, that, that it's representing

00:01:41.418 --> 00:01:45.180
now you know. Really really really really big.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.010
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.060
&gt;&gt; So one way of putting it is, you know if you think

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.320
about the farthest point, as opposed to

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.110
the furthest point which would be incorrect.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.360
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.850
&gt;&gt; The farthest point that this particular first x

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.690
over here is representing, its got some distance here.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.940
Over here, the farthest point from this x, the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.620
distance is very, very far away. So, a question

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.810
would be, how can I make it so that each of

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.070
the x's I put down represents the same amount of. I

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.310
don't know diameter or distance as the xs in this line

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.960
segment over here. So what do you think I have to do?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.840
&gt;&gt; I feel like you need to fill up the square with xs.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right so let's do that. So

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.710
filling em up Michael as you suggested. You'll notice that

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.490
at least if we pretend that I drew this right. Each of

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.330
these X's is now going to end up being the nearest neighbor for

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.170
a little square like this, and the diameter of these little squares are

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.920
going to be the same as the diameter of these little line segments.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree for some definition of the word diameter.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.800
&gt;&gt; Yes, and for some definition of our demonstration. Okay, so how

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.430
many of these X's are there, Michael? Can you tell? You want to count?

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.671
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:02:57.671 --> 00:03:00.401
I'm going to multiple [CROSSTALK] cause it looks like

00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:02.620
you did ten by ten so that'll be 100.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.010
&gt;&gt; That'll be 100. So each one now holds a hundredth of the space, and I went

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.010
from needing ten points to, of course, 100 points

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.870
in order to cover the same amount of space.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.140
&gt;&gt; Alright, so that definitely seems like the mild rebuke of dimensionality.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.990
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.530
&gt;&gt; But doesn't seem that bad.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.760
&gt;&gt; Okay well, what happens if I now move into three dimensions?

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.900
So now, if I want to cover the same amount of, you know,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.000
diameter space for, you know, sufficient

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.770
definition of diameter. I'm going to have

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.080
to do a bunch of copying and pasting that I'm not willing

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.960
to do so, you know, there would be more x's here and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.690
you know, there will be x's there and an x here and

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.510
it'll just kind of go and fill up some space and you

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.378
know, I'm not going to do this whatever but [SOUND] and you'll get

00:03:45.378 --> 00:03:48.950
x's everywhere. And you notice, I need a lot more X's than

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.660
I had before. And by the way, I'm just

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.850
showing you the outside of this little cube, there are

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.890
actually X's on the inside as well, that you

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.210
can't see. How many X's do you think I have?

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.450
&gt;&gt; I don't think you drew any X's. You're

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.360
just like scribbling on the side of the cube.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.160
&gt;&gt; These are X's.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.840
&gt;&gt; You, you were doing so well for awhile, and then just lost it entirely.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.210
&gt;&gt; Well, wouldn't you lose it if you had to write 1000 x's.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.790
&gt;&gt; Hm. No

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.870
because I would use computers to help me but yes, yes it is very

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.700
frustrating to have to have that many x's. And so but in particular in

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.770
this case we're talking about data points in a nearest neighbor method and that,

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.346
boy that does seem like a big growth from ten to a 100 to 1000.

00:04:29.346 --> 00:04:31.576
&gt;&gt; In fact the growth is, exponential.

00:04:31.576 --> 00:04:32.628
&gt;&gt; Exponential

00:04:32.628 --> 00:04:36.290
&gt;&gt; &gt;Right. So if we went into four dimensions, which

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.986
I'm not going to draw, then we would need not

00:04:39.986 --> 00:04:44.267
1,000, but 10,000 points. And if five dimensions we would

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:48.184
need 100,000 points. And in six dimensions, we would need 1,000,000

00:04:48.184 --> 00:04:51.990
points. And so on and so forth. So something like.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.070
Ten to the D, where D is the number of dimensions.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.370
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.880
&gt;&gt; Right. So this is really problematic right.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.460
In my little nearest neighbor method, wanted to be

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.870
able to say, well, I want to make

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.470
sure the neighborhood remains small, as I add dimensions,

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.530
I'm going to need to grow the number of points that

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.100
I have in my training set exponentially. And that's really bad.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.912
And by the way, this isn't just an issue of

00:05:14.912 --> 00:05:17.860
kNN. This is true in general, don't think about this now

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.290
as nearest neighbors in the sense of kNN, but think

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.950
of it as points that are representing or covering the space.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.340
And if you want to represent the same sort of hyper-volume

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.160
of space as you add dimensions, you're going to have to get

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.030
exponentially more points in order to do that. And

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.630
coverage is necessary to do learning. So the curse

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.830
of dimensionality does not just to kNN.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.930
It is a curse of dimensionality for ML period [SOUND].

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.990
&gt;&gt; You mean for me?

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.252
&gt;&gt; Yes. Because of [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:49.252 --> 00:05:53.030
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay. And that seems really problematic because it's very

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.470
natural to just keep throwing dimensions into a machine learning problem.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.940
Like it's, it's having trouble learning. Let me

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.640
give it a few more dimensions so, to give

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.820
it hints. But really what you're doing is just

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.150
giving it a larger and larger volume to fill.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And it can't fill it unless you give it more and more

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.120
data. So you're better off giving more data than you are giving more dimensions.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.910
&gt;&gt; Zoinks.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.650
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. There's an entire series of lessons that

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.800
we will get eventually that, that deals with this issue.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.150
&gt;&gt; The issue of?

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.250
&gt;&gt; Dimensionality.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.540
&gt;&gt; Finding the right dimensionality?

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.430
&gt;&gt; That would be a useful thing.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.560
&gt;&gt; It would. But it's far off in the future. It's like infinitely

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.980
far in the future. So we'll worry about that in a few weeks.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.150
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.760
&gt;&gt; Okay. All right. So there you go, Michael.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.200
Curse of Dimensionality is real and it's a real problem.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.790
&gt;&gt; Where did that term come from, it's a cool

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.420
term. I think it came from, oh what's his name. Bellman.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.960
&gt;&gt; Oh, Bellman, like the dynamic programming guy.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.362
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the dynamic programming guy,

00:06:46.362 --> 00:06:50.910
uh,the Bellman of Bellman equation guy.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.580
&gt;&gt; Which we haven't gotten to yet in the course.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.640
&gt;&gt; Which we haven't gotten to in the course but we will get to in the

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.440
course. Because it's central. So it looks like

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.110
actually, the element's central to a lot of things.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.070
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.860
&gt;&gt; Sometimes it gives us equations that

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.260
helps us but sometimes it gives us curses.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.490
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Curses Betterman. Foiled again.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.837
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
