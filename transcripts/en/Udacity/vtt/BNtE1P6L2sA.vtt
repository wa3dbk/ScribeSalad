00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Why are we bothering to write an interpreter for JavaScript that just runs Python in the end anyway?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Shouldn't we just write our code in Python directly and skip the middle step?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That's an interesting idea and one that I think gets to the heart of language design.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Programming languages, as we know them, are actually

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
relatively old in the history of computer science.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
John Bacchus starting with speed coding, perhaps the first interpreted language, in 1953

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and moved on to FORTRAN, which is still alive and going well, in around 1957.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Around the same time Admiral Grace Hopper made the first compiler around 1952

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and started really promulgating languages like FLOW-MATIC in 1957.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Let's imagine that we transplant this question back in time.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You're in the '60s saying, "You know? If I write this program in FORTRAN,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
ultimately it gets interpreted in assembly language and machine code.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Why should I bother with FORTRAN? Why not write it all in assembly language?"

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Or these days more modern languages like Java were initially implemented in

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
languages like C. Why bother with Java, if we could write everything in C?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It turns out that all of the modern programming languages that we are considering--

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Java, C++, C#, F# --

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
are all Turing completed, a term I won't define in this class explicitly,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
but it deals with Turing and models of computations--they're all equally powerful.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Anything I could do in one language, I could do in another.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now it's a matter of choice and expediency.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Some languages make it easier to write somethings or say some thoughts than others,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and some make it easier to do it with fewer errors,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and that's where I think the key motivations for modern languages really come from.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I think in the future, we're going to see an explosion, a proliferation, a profusion

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of domain-specific languages--languages that aren't trying to be C or Java

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
but are trying to solve a very particular problem and do it quite well.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
There are already a number of languages out there for dealing with mathematics,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
things like MATLAB or Maple or Mathematica.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
There are a number of ones out there for describing graphics.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Game design actually has a history of using a number of domain-specific languages

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
going all the way back to QuakeC from John Carmack.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Even more modern at the time of this writing,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
modern games like Skyrim feature their own languages for describing events and quests--

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Papyrus--check it out. Although they're based on relatively old programming language concepts.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Another more modern example is there are a number of hardware definition languages--

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
VHDL and Veralog.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Whenever Intel to some degree decides to design a new chip,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
they use a hardware definition language rather than C or Java or Python to describe it.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
These domain-specific languages hold out the promise of having higher-level operations

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and of helping you catch common mistakes.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That's really important in economic terms for saving money in software engineering.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I want to make it take less time for you to write the program,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and I want to reduce the number of faults that we're going to find in it later.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I think one of the advantages of more modern languages over something like C

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
is that they feature higher order datatypes.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
In Python if you want a list or a dictionary it's easy to write it with just a little bit of syntax.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
In C you'd need to have those datatypes prepared or do all of the allocation yourself.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It just takes longer, and it's easier for errors to creep in.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I think one of the things that's been driving changes in programming languages over time

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
is that we're recognizing that correctness is often more important than speed

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
for many applications. Speed is still critical, but bugs can be really expensive.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Especially in the financial district or in mission-critical applications.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
If you're making an airplane autopilot or an artificial heart pump.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Languages where one line of code creates a dictionary and initializes it with some value

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
save you a lot of work. You don't have to write out all of the lines to create that dictionary.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
As a result, you don't have to write out any lines with bugs in them.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
The fewer lines you can write, the more you can just declare your will and have the compiler

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
fill it in, the happier I am.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I think that there is a real reason to keep designing new languages,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
even if we bootstrap them on top of the old ones,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
because it might be easier or more concise to think a thought in the new language

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
or because the new language might help us reduce errors or software engineering defects.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Even thought our simple JavaScript interpreter is ultimately written in Python,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
webpages typically include JavaScript rather than Python, it's handy.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
People find it easier to write in one of these languages rather than the other,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
even though they're all Turing complete and can express the same computations.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
It's kind of a deep question and one that gets to personal choice and creativity.

00:04:51.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Sometimes we just prefer one language over another, even if they're all ultimately the same.
