00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. Here's our answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Each of these areas here is a region. I'm just numbering them.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Then there's also a region which is the outside box. Seven regions in this example.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's check Euler's formula again for this one.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We've got n = 10, m = 15, and 7 regions.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
N - m is -5, plus 7 is 2. Ta da!
