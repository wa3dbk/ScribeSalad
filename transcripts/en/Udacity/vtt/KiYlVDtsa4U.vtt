00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.636
Well right here, is the point that's the minimum, the vertex of the parabola. It

00:00:04.636 --> 00:00:09.150
looks like its height, or its vertical coordinate is 3 and its horizontal

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.089
coordinate is 2. Since the vertex of an upward facing parabola represents the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.953
minimum point on the entire curve, 3 is the lowest y value, or lowest value of f

00:00:18.953 --> 00:00:21.908
of x, that any point on this fuction will have.
