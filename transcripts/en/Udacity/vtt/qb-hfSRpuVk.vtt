00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.710
Object-oriented programming is one of those things where, there's just so many

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.950
reasons to use it that I can't think of a reason not to use it. I think, first

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.838
of all, so much of the programming that is done in industry today uses objects

00:00:14.838 --> 00:00:20.670
and object-oriented programming. And you almost cannot be in industry without

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.840
knowing what these things are. The second reason is that object-oriented

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.180
programming really falls in line with the way you and I think. So, you and I

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.510
think of a person as an object having a height and a weight and an eye color.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.560
And, all sorts of attributes. And that's exactly how object-oriented

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.210
programming works. It works the way we think. Which is why it's great to know

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.479
how to use it, because it'll make your job as a programmer a lot easier.
