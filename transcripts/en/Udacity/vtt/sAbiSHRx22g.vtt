00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.230
So JP, I did initial competitor analysis
and I estimated what the user base is

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.070
out there, and kind of what
the cash opportunity is, and

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.830
I gotta say things
are looking pretty good.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.360
Now there are a couple of other
competitors in this space.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.590
But if we focus on things like the
realtime update nature of the app and

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.270
the collaborative nature of the app,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.590
I think we really have the runway
to make this idea take off.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.030
&gt;&gt; Great, so you mentioned some
initial wireframes for the app?

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.990
I think we'll want to
divide this into stages.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.220
We can call these versions and
release the app to testers accordingly.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.050
Version 0.1 is where we'll decide what
kind of stack we're going to use.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.750
Once we've done that,
we'll take the minimum viable product,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.040
also known as the simplest
version of the app.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.570
That version will be
focused on writing and

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.540
reading one piece of data from the
online data store that we just set up.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.990
&gt;&gt; Sounds good, and then in version 0.2
you could build out the other screens,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.510
create the bulk of the data that
gets stored in the database, and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.132
decide how to visualize it and
connect it to the database.

00:00:56.132 --> 00:00:59.660
&gt;&gt; We're going to need to add user
authentication at some point.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.280
&gt;&gt; That could be for version 0.3.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.040
You could add a sign in and create
account screen to the app that will

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.460
allow for authentication and
user accounts.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.500
&gt;&gt; That sounds good.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.980
And in the 0.4 release, we can cover how
to use all the user data that we just

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.540
grabbed to allow for sharing user lists.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.890
Also, since we're
accumulating all that data,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.059
we'll probably want some way to sort and
filter it.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.730
And you'll need to adjust security and
permissions at some point.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.460
You don't want to have your data just
laying around for anyone to access.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.250
Maybe that's shopping list plus
plus 0.5 or maybe that's 1.0.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.680
&gt;&gt; Okay, so it looks like we have a
pretty good road map of the app sketched

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.410
out, but I'll keep checking in with you
both to make sure that we're on track.
