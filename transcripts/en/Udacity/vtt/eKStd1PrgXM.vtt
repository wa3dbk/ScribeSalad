00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.016
So now that we've talked about integers
quite a bit, let's talk about which

00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:08.924
numbers actually are integers. We already
know a bunch of examples of integers since

00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:13.471
we know that all whole numbers and
therefore all natural numbers are

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:19.605
integers. So any number that we could get
to by starting at 0 and counting up by 1s

00:00:19.617 --> 00:00:24.977
is an integer. These numbers however are
just the positive integers plus 0 of

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.695
course. But there are also a ton of other
numbers that are integers and these are

00:00:30.707 --> 00:00:36.313
the negative integers. The negative
integers are just negative versions of all

00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:42.081
of the positive integers. So, since 3 is
an integer, negative 3 is also an integer.

00:00:42.197 --> 00:00:48.156
The integers are all numbers from negative
infinity, to positive infinity that can be

00:00:48.168 --> 00:00:51.107
written without any fractions or decimals.
