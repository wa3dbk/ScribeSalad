00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.203
As we'll see later on, electronic
prescribing or e-prescribing for

00:00:05.203 --> 00:00:10.500
short is a key requirement of the new
federal EHR adoption programs.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.930
Because electronic prescriptions
are clear and legible and

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.980
an EMR can often spot potential
problems as prescriptions are written.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.960
E-Prescribing has been shown to
dramatically reduce medication errors

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.040
within a year of being adopted.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.960
As you can see here they decline from
42.5 per 100 descriptions to 6.6

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.675
within a year of this practice, or the
typical practice adopting e-prescribing.

00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:38.410
While of course they remain the same
in those practices that continued

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.140
to manually prescribe.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.280
Someday soon hopefully, each provider
will have a full medication record,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.440
including whether patients
are filling their prescriptions and

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.240
then refilling them at
the proper interval.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.490
Both are currently major problems.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.910
Currently patient privacy concerns, the
topic of lesson four are an impediment

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.930
to routinely and automatically
providing this information.
