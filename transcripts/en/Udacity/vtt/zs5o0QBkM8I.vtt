00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.390
Let's start with the simplest case.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.500
That is, we have a one-to-one association and

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.800
we're always going to traverse it in a single direction.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.430
We can do that with a simple pointer.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.350
Instances of class a are always going to refer to instances of class,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.800
exactly one instance of class b.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.380
And we're always going to go from the direction from a to b.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.686
You just have a simple pointer, which means in an object-oriented language,

00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:27.930
we have an attribute of the target type in our, in our class.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.510
Okay, this is quite simple to do.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.610
And it even extends in the case where there might be multiple instances in

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.840
the target class associated with a particular instance in the source class.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.160
In that case, instead of just using a simple pointer,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.350
we use a vector of pointers.
