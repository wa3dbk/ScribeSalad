We have a count i that goes from 10 to 20. And, so we print 10, 11, 12, 13,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:20.863
114, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. That now was ten numbers, and we print the 20, because

00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:28.245
over here there was a less than or equal sign. So we print a total of 11

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:32.479
numbers. It's the same as she has with the fencepost, one more number than one

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.830
might have expected. This is a common error, and people call it a fencepost

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.820
error. You don't want those fencepost errors, and here it the way to avoid

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.799
them.
