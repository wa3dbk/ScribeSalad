00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.760
The answer is no. If you think back to other curves you've looked at, like

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.708
parabolas for example. We saw that we could shift the curves up and down, and

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:13.292
we can do the same thing with rational functions, even with the graphs you've

00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:19.012
already worked with. In fact, here's what the graph of 4 over x minus 1 would

00:00:19.012 --> 00:00:23.228
look like If we shifted it up 1, we can see that now the horizontal asymptote

00:00:23.228 --> 00:00:28.163
is at y equals 1, instead of at y equals 0.
