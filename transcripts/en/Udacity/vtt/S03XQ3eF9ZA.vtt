00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's go over now how we can actually solve the top K problem using this idea of partitioning.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now, remember what we're given her is the list L and some number K

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and what we're interested in are the top K elements of L,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and for the sake of simplicity in this example by top--I mean the smallest,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the one that have the smallest values.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You can always put things around, turn the right greater ends into less ends

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and so forth and everything will be fixed,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but for now, let's just imagine that we're interested in the smallest element--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the smallest K elements if the lists were sorted.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Here's what we're going to do.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We're going to start off--remember we know how to do a partitioning is giving some v,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
well I don't know which value to use, so let's just pick one at random.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Here I am picking a value at random--let's say there.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There's our value v, and now, we're going to run the partitioning algorithm on this,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and there is a couple of different cases that can happen.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We're going to look first at this case 2 because that's the super duper easy one.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
In this case 2, we pick some v at random

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and it just so happens that we totally locked out and the rank of v is exactly K.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What happens when we run partitioning on that value v

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
is it's going to separate all the values of L into the ones smaller than v, equal to v, and greater than v,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and that happens to be position K,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
so the ones on the first K positioned here are exactly the top K for the list,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the smallest K elements that we were looking for.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
In this case, we're done--we locked out.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But that's only one of the three cases. We need to look at the other cases now.
