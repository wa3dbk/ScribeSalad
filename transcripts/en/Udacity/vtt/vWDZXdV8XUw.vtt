00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.280
As with everything else,

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.630
when building an app for Geo Fencing,
you'll need a GoogleAPIClient.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.390
You've seen these earlier in the course,
and you've seen how to set them up, so

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.630
let's assume at this point
that you've done that.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.008
In order for your app to monitor
the GeoFences, you have to define them.

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:18.700
And a GeoFence is defined
using the GeoFence object,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.730
which you create using
a GeoFence Builder.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.880
It takes the following properties.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.170
Latitude and longitude define where
the GeoFence is in the world.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.680
These are just the typical latitude and

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.860
longitude that define
any location anywhere.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.690
The radius defines a circular area
around the latitude and longitude.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.770
This determines how close
the user needs to be

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.250
to that location from any direction
before any alert gets triggered.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.650
The expiration time determines how
long the fence should remain active.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.960
Once this time expires,
the GeoFence is deleted.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.700
And you can of course set up
permanent ones if you like.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.880
And the GeoFence ID is
an identifier to use so

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.740
that you can know which
GeoFence has been triggered.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.620
This should be unique.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.700
If you consider the fact that GeoFences
are based on latitude and longitude and

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.270
a circle around them, you can actually
have GeoFences that overlap each other.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.366
When a user enters a particular space,
they may trigger two or more GeoFences.

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.945
As such, as a developer,
you may want to know which ones, and

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:19.815
you do that using
the ID of the GeoFence.

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:24.535
Now, I'm going to define a GeoFence
as looking something like this.

00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:28.545
You can then define a number of
GeoFences as an array of GeoFence

00:01:28.545 --> 00:01:29.625
objects.

00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:33.305
So, I'm going to wrap the list of
GeoFences in ArrayList like this.

00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:35.800
Once you have your
ArrayList of GeoFences,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.760
you can then use
a GeoFencingRequest class

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.830
simply by calling its addGeoFences
method and passing the ArrayList to it.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.650
Once this is working, you can then add
the GeoFencingRequest to your client and

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.830
specify a pending intent that is
used to process the call backs

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.180
from the location services API.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.340
This pending intent
uses an intent service

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.730
in a similar way to the address
example that we saw earlier.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.660
Now, whenever a GeoFencing
action happens,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.560
the intent service will catch it,
and it will route it to your app.
