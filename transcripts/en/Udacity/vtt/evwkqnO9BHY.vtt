00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.114
To find the pooled variance. We add the sum of squares, and then divide by the

00:00:04.114 --> 00:00:08.375
total degrees of freedom. Which is the degrees of freedom from x plus the

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:15.277
degrees of freedom from y. 3 plus 2 which is 5. We get 15.2.
