00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.014
Your task was to complete the implementation of the addChoice method, and the

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:09.006
previous step you had added the choice string to the list of choices. Now we

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:12.917
want to take this parameter into account. And if were handed the correct

00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:17.005
choice, we want to update the answer. Now the answer is the string, such as

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:21.274
three if we're currently at the third choice. So, over here, we can find out

00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:25.348
what the current choice is by measuring the size of the choice array. When

00:00:25.348 --> 00:00:28.803
we're at the third choice, there are three choices in the array. The number

00:00:28.803 --> 00:00:32.770
that we need is three, but we need it as a string not as a number. That's the

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.610
step here. Now, this is the string that we need to set as the answer of our

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.802
question. I've talked about that, you cannot simply access the instance

00:00:39.802 --> 00:00:43.645
variable of the super class, but mercifully, we have a method from the super

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:48.840
class that does just that, namely setAnswer. So, all we have to do is call

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.832
setAnswer. SetAnswer by the way is an inherited method that we simply get to

00:00:52.832 --> 00:00:56.530
call. Alright. Now you've implemented your first subclass method completely.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.331
And next, we'll turn to implementing the display method.
