00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.455
Let's find the domain and range of another rational function. This time I want

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:09.215
us to look at y equals x times x squared minus 1 over 2x squared times x

00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:15.089
squared minus 3x plus 2. To figure out the domain You'll need to look for

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.047
values of x where the function is undefined, focusing of course on the

00:00:18.047 --> 00:00:22.466
denominator. To figure out the range, first see if this function has a

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.938
horizontal asymptote, and if it does, see if any values of x that we can plug

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:31.820
in, End up giving us that value Y that we saw in the asymptote. For this quiz I

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.175
would like you to tell me the domain and the range, by simply writing in the

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:40.176
values that X and Y cannot equal. If more than one value belongs in a single

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:44.793
box, separate your answers by commas. If you want to leave up box blank, then

00:00:44.793 --> 00:00:46.979
write the word none instead.
