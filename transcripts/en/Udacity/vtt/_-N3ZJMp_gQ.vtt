00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:07.942
W'll start by rewriting 9 16ths as 3 squared divided by 4 squared. We can do

00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:12.550
this since we know 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16. Next, we're going to

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.464
pull out our exponent of 2 from each part of the fraction. So we'll just have 3

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:21.803
4ths raised to the 2nd power. Now again, I'm so close to having these bases

00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:28.300
match. I have 4 3rds here, but I have 3 4ths here. In order to get these two

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.180
bases to match, we need to flip this base. So, we'll use a negative exponent to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.180
do that. So, 3 4ths squared is the same thing as 4 3rds raised to the negative

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.024
second power. Remember, this negative 1, or this exponent of negative 1, flips

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:49.635
over our base. Now we have two bases that are the same, so we can set the

00:00:49.635 --> 00:00:55.593
exponents equal. X must equal negative 2.
