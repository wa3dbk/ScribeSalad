00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.480
So far I've used the term pixel.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.240
Let's try to understand what that pixel is in the context of an image.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.510
A pixel, or a picture element, is basically the element that

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.870
contains the light intensity at some location within that image.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.430
In this case i and j of that image.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.510
So for example, what we're really interested in is now we have the scope and

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.570
the boundary of this image here, which is known by its width and height.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.270
But I also want to know within it at any location here what would

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.070
be various intensities within that image?

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.740
And I want to be able to do this for all aspects or all parts of this image.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.000
So for example at the ith and the jth index, this is the val, this is the pixel.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.830
What would be the intensity value at that location?

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.360
In essence, a computational aspect of all of this is,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.048
that I want to be able to create either a discrete representation or

00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:54.240
a continuous representation that I can now, by giving it values of i and j,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.540
give it some numeric value of what this image would be.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.290
Because once I get this numerical value, I could use it for

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.880
various types of computational steps.
