00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.380
So, I guess you could sum up optimizing

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.690
the critical rendering path, as having three main objectives.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.630
Reducing the number of critical bytes. Reducing the number

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.410
of critical resources. And shortening the critical path length.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.440
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so your job is to make the

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.210
critical rendering path as small and as short as possible.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.885
&gt;&gt; Definitely, okay so I'm going to go back and run my page through

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:30.540
PageSpeed Insight again and this time I'll get some recommendations I can act on and

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.180
I can't wait to start optimizing my site.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.100
&gt;&gt; Awesome, I'm glad to hear that. Web performance is a big topic

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.740
and there's a lot more to learn. So when you go through PageSpeed

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.690
Insights, make sure you follow the links to learn about other things. It

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.780
all adds up in the end. Are you ready to do the final project?

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.960
&gt;&gt; Alright, now that we've taken the full

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.130
tour through the critical rendering path, I think

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.720
you've got all the tools you need to make. The site render as fast as possible,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.260
ideally in under one second. And Cameron's portfolio site needs a lot of work.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.040
If we run it through PageSpeed Insights, we see that it's scoring pretty low.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.720
&gt;&gt; As a final challenge, use what you've learned in this class to help me

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.950
optimize my site. Your goal is to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.630
improve the PageSpeed Insight score above a 90.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.220
&gt;&gt; Right, and to do this you'll need to do a few things. First, fork the

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.720
projects Github repo. You can find a link

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.010
to it in the instructor notes. Then analyze

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.830
it using the techniques like drawing

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.790
the critical rendering path diagram and diagnosing

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.530
the. Protocol path metrics. Then apply

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.740
the optimizations. And publish it on GitHub

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.630
pages. If you're not familiar with GitHub, you can find some links in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.640
the instructor notes helping you fork the repo and publish your site on GitHub.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.790
&gt;&gt; Once you finish your optimizations. Run your

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.100
new and improved portfolio through the PageSpeed Insights.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.380
You'll see all sorts of suggestions that should make some sense now, like

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.480
optimized CSS delivery and removed render

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.600
blocking JavaScript. When you think you've done

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.160
all the optimization you can, post what changes you made on the forums

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.300
along with the URL of your portfolio and the new PageSpeed Insights score.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.850
&gt;&gt; And while you're at it, why don't you make

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.810
the portfolio page your own? You can use it to

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.510
showcase the projects you're proud of. We've got a link

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.410
in the instructor notes to help you out. Good luck.
