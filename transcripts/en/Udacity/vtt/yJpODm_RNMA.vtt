00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The next thing we're going to look at

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is how big does the hash output need to be

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to provide the properties we need?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So first let's just consider a weak collision resistance.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So the question is assuming that our attacker has just enough computing power

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to perform 2 to the 62 hashes, how many bits should our ideal hash function--and

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we're assuming now that we have an ideal hash function that provides a perfect

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
uniform distribution on the outputs--to provide weak collision resistance?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And to formalize what we mean by providing that, let's assume

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that we're satisfied as long as the attacker's success probability of finding

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
some pre-image that hashes to our value H is less than one-half.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Of course, for most applications we want this probability to be much less than one-half.

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
To answer, give the number of bits in the output of H.
