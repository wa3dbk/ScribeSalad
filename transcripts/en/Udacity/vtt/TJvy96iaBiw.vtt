00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.160
Whenever faced with a new technology or

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.090
library, I always like to interactively explore it.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.090
Whether that be in a in my terminal or the console in a webpage.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.150
I find that having immediate feedback, and in the case of the Chrome developer

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.168
tools method auto-complete, greatly increases the speed in which I can learn.

00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:24.660
Again go into the top menu bar in the upper-right of the window,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.702
scrolling down to the Tools sub-menu, and then opening up the Developer Tools,

00:00:30.702 --> 00:00:35.440
or Cmd+Option+I, we'll see a split pane.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.270
In this case, we have the HTML of the page,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.880
the JavaScript console, and the visual display of that page.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.370
We are fortunate that we're learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.850
D3 since we can access and inspect all the code used to construct a web page.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.260
Simply by opening the browser's console or looking at the source.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.230
If we would like to look at the raw source file, we can click on the menu again,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.270
go back to Tools, and simply click View Source to see the textural content of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.020
the page without any of the other Chrome tools.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.320
When we request from udacity.com the course and the exact HTML

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.110
page we get returned the HTML source content which the web browser then parses.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.220
Well it looks like the HTML source displayed in the web console of

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.090
the developer tools is actually the DOM representation of the HTML

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.060
source file I just showed you.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.720
Notice as you hover over specific elements they get

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.580
highlighted in the visual display of the corresponding visual element.
