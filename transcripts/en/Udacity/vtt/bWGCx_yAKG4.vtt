00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.648
Children with ASD do not follow the patterns that are typical when developing

00:00:03.648 --> 00:00:08.090
their social and communication skills. If you recall from our lesson on

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.930
development, here we see that these children do not reach the same milestone

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.590
markers in the areas of social skills and communication as you typically

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.176
develop in children. Some of the symptoms or signs of AS include, making little

00:00:23.176 --> 00:00:27.397
eye contact, failing to respond to other people, tending to look and listen

00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:31.752
less to people and to their environment, and responding unusually when other

00:00:31.752 --> 00:00:39.293
people show signs of anger, distress or affection. Children with ASD seem not

00:00:39.293 --> 00:00:43.847
to respond appropriately, as defined by prevailing social norms to emotional

00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:49.818
queues and human social interactions. In addition, some children with ASD also

00:00:49.818 --> 00:00:56.350
engage repeatitive actions that are termed stereotypy or stereotyped behaviors.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.185
Stereotyped behavior can be defined as persistent mechanical repetition of

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:06.106
speech or movement, or ritualistic movements like hand flapping or rocking. The

00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:10.540
number of individuals diagnosed with ASD has increased throughout the years.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.656
And currently rates are approximately 60 per 1,000 births. Why do you think

00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:19.990
there has been an increase in the number of children being diagnosed with ASD.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.083
