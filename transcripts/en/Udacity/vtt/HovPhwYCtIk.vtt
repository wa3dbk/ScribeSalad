00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.957
So, let's go back to the code we have for extracting the first URL in a page

00:00:03.957 --> 00:00:07.324
and see how we can turn that into a procedure.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:10.561
And remember, we made many copies of the same code

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.803
if we wanted to extract many links from the page.

00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:16.931
What we want to do now is take the part that we kept having to copy

00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:20.884
and figure out how to turn that into a procedure.

00:00:20.884 --> 00:00:23.346
What we want to do is take this code--

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:26.539
we're going to take all the code here--

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.378
I'm leaving this part out of the procedure,

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:32.509
because that's what we want to do with the results--

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.388
what we want to do is take all this code

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:36.224
and turn it into a procedure.

00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:39.392
That means, instead of having to do all this work each time,

00:00:39.392 --> 00:00:40.926
what we want is a procedure

00:00:40.926 --> 00:00:42.309
that will start from what we have here--

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.651
we have the "page."

00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:45.236
What we want to do is from the "page,"

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:48.334
do a bunch of work; get the URL.

00:00:48.334 --> 00:00:50.732
Then, we want to do some stuff with the URL,

00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:52.445
want to do some stuff with the page,

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:54.288
and then we're going to do it all over again.

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:57.918
Our goal is to figure out how to turn this part of the code into a procedure,

00:00:57.918 --> 00:01:01.078
so we could keep reusing that, each time,

00:01:01.078 --> 00:01:04.616
instead of writing the same code.

00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:07.836
We need a little more room, so let's shrink the code we had.

00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:10.685
Now the question is, how are we going to make that procedure?

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:12.728
Let's start with a quiz:

00:01:12.728 --> 00:01:14.917
When we think about making a procedure,

00:01:14.917 --> 00:01:17.957
the first thing we always want to do is make sure that we understand this:

00:01:17.957 --> 00:01:20.301
we need to know what the inputs are to that procedure;

00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:22.048
we need to know what the outputs are.

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:24.474
If we don't understand the inputs and outputs,

00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:26.897
then there's no hope of writing the procedure correctly

00:01:26.897 --> 00:01:28.271
since the main purpose of the procedure

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:30.899
is to map the inputs into the outputs.

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.278
Let's see if you can figure out what the inputs should be

00:01:33.278 --> 00:01:36.723
for the procedure that we want to make to replace this code.

00:01:36.723 --> 00:01:40.286
I'm going to give the procedure a name.

00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:42.421
The goal of the procedure is to find the URL

00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:45.257
that's the next link target in this page,

00:01:45.257 --> 00:01:48.006
so we'll call the procedure, "get_next_target"--

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:50.202
it's important to give good names to procedures;

00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:52.580
that's how we remember what they're supposed to do--

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.105
and we'll use the name "get_next_target."

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:57.358
So, our question now is, in defining this procedure,

00:01:57.358 --> 00:01:59.734
what should its inputs be?

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.505
I'll give you some choices:

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:05.956
its input could be a number giving the position of the start of the next link;

00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:10.482
its input could be a number giving the position of the start of the next quote;

00:02:10.482 --> 00:02:14.270
its input could be a string giving the contents of the rest of the web page;

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.133
and, for the final choice, we could have two inputs--

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:20.486
the first, a number giving the position of the start of the next link,

00:02:20.486 --> 00:07:26.000
and the second, a string giving the contents of the page.
