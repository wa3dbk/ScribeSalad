00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.250
As operating system designers, the natural question

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.010
that comes up is, okay, all this sounds

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.050
good. But do I lose out on

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.570
performance for the convenience of component-based design? This

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.630
is the same question that came up when we wanted to go for a microkernel-based

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.920
design, away from a monolithic design of

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.520
an operating system. The Cornell experiment takes it

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.880
one step further and argues for

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.910
synthesizing individual subsystems of an operating system

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.920
from modular components. Just like putting

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.440
together lego blocks to get the desired

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.580
functionality. I encourage you to read the paper from Cornell in full. That

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.860
shows that this methodology, applied to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.820
one specific subsystem, results in a performance

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.670
competitive implementation of the protocol

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.920
stack, compared to a monolithic implementation.
