00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.243
So I'm going to start by taking my total amount of money and splitting it into

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:08.328
fifths. Notice that 1 whole circle is 5 5ths. I'm going to save 2 5ths of my

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.621
money, so let's show that on a another circle. And I'm going to save 2 5ths of

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:16.853
my total money. I don't know how much total money I have but I know I'm saving

00:00:16.865 --> 00:00:18.217
this fraction. Money.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.595
I'm trying to figure out what fraction I have left that I can still spend.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.361
Visually, I can see that I still have 3 5ths of my money to spend. So how did I

00:00:27.373 --> 00:00:32.058
get that? I did 5 5ths, that was the whole amount of money I had, and I need to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.639
subtract off 2 5ths. So I have 5 5ths minus 2 5ths. So I'm taking away 2 5ths

00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:41.645
from my 5 5ths. So I just need to subtract the numerators. So 5 5th's take away

00:00:41.657 --> 00:00:46.670
2 5th's leaves me with 3 5th's. I work with subtracting just like I do with

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:52.095
adding fractions. I only change the numerators, all I'm doing is taking my 5th's

00:00:52.107 --> 00:00:57.120
and taking out two of them, leaving me with 3 5th's. If you got 3 5th's, nice

00:00:57.132 --> 00:01:01.561
work. Whether you know it or not, you've already started thinking algebraically.

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:05.627
I have no idea how much money you can earn in a month but we've let that amount

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:09.814
represent this circle. It was an abstract form of reasoning. We knew that if you

00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:13.912
saved 2 5ths of it that you would have 3 5ths of it left to spend on whatever

00:01:13.924 --> 00:01:17.742
you please. So, even though I don't know the total amount of money, I can still

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:21.216
say at least what fraction of that money can be spent. One of the key skills in

00:01:21.228 --> 00:01:24.736
algebra is to find ways to work with unknown amounts or numbers. We'll see this

00:01:24.748 --> 00:01:26.036
throughout the entire course.
