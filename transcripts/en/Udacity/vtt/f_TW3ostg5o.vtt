00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.050
Let's get to handling our
second integration point,

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.710
between the application and the user.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.170
In particular, we allow for
free form text entry of the location.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.980
That means there are multiple ways
the user can get something wrong.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.800
The user can input text that doesn't
actually resolve to a location or

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.660
the user can input text that resolves
to a different location than they

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.380
are expecting.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.520
We're going to look at
handling the first problem,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.540
the user inputting text that
doesn't resolve to a location.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.140
The second problem is a bit trickier.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.300
Many users use ZIP codes to set
their location, because we use that,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.500
by default, in our application.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.430
One of the fascinating parts about the
world's postal system is the fact that

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.870
postal codes tend to be unique within
each country, rather than truly unique.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.000
As a result, sometimes a postal
code in which was intended for

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.220
location in the United States will
return information for a location

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.300
outside the United States, even if
the postal code is properly written.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.090
In addition,
there are often cities around the world

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.670
that share the same name.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.090
Unless the user types in the entire
name, including state, province, and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.019
country, we may get this wrong as well.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.860
Note that we currently have
a function that maps the location.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.630
So, a determined user can find out where
their weather search is geolocated.
