00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:05.560
The equation would be x squared plus y squared equals 100. Great work if you

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.018
got that equation. We know, this is the equation of any circle centered at the

00:00:10.018 --> 00:00:16.430
origin. We just need to know the radius, r. In this case, the r value is 10.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.800
So, we just plug in 10 for r. We'll have this equation. And then simplifying 10

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.890
squared, we'll get 100. So, this is the equation for our circle.
