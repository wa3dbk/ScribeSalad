You just ran three demo programs. The first program gave the correct view of

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:06.971
the scene. The next two demos were a bit more mysterious, call them mystery

00:00:06.971 --> 00:00:10.360
demos number 1 and number 2. The question to you is, which of the following is

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.378
true? Number 1 draws objects in a fixed order, number 2 draws objects front to

00:00:16.378 --> 00:00:19.544
back. Number 1 draws objects front to back, number 2 draws objects back to

00:00:19.544 --> 00:00:23.273
front. Number one draws objects front to back, number two draws objects in a

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:26.947
fixed order. Or number one draws objects in a fixed order, number two draws

00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:28.560
objects back to front.
