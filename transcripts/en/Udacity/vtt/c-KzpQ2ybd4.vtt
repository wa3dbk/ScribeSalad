00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.410
So we've got a notification appearing,
but our goal is to give the user

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.040
a button they can press to
get the latest version.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.760
Clicking this button needs to
tell the waiting service worker

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.710
that it should take over straightaway,
bypassing the usual life cycle.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.340
Then we want to refresh the page so

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.630
it reloads with the latest
assets from the newest cache.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.030
There are three new components
that help us achieve this.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.120
A service worker can call skipWaiting
while it's waiting or installing.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.880
This signals that it shouldn't queue
behind another service worker.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.460
It should take over straight away.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.120
We want to call this when
the user hits the refresh button

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.140
in our update notification.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.550
But how do we send the signal from
the page to the waiting service worker?

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.610
Your page can send messages to any
service worker using postMessage.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.670
And you can listen for messages in the
service worker using the message event.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.410
So, when the user clicks
the refresh button it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.595
will send a message to our service
worker telling it to call skip waiting.

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:58.270
And the final part, we've already seen
navigator.serviceworker.controller but

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.550
the page gets an event
when its value changes,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.052
meaning a new service
worker has taken over.

00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:05.840
We're going to use this as a signal
that we should reload the page.
