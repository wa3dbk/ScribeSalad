00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.320
To deal with the mutual exclusion problem, pthread supports mutexes.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.650
As we explained when discussing Birrell's paper, mutexes provide a mechanism to

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.490
solve the mutual exclusion problems among concurrent threads.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.010
Mutual exclusion let's us ensure that threads access shared state in

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.800
a controlled manner.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.300
So that only one thread at a time can perform modifications or

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.780
otherwise access that shared variable.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.510
Birrell proposed the use of the mutex itself and an operation to lock mutexes.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.830
In pthreads, the mutex data structure is represented via pi pthread mutex type.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.757
For the log operation, remember that Birrell used the block construct where

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:46.715
the critical section was protected by these curly brackets.

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:51.321
Where the open curly bracket meant that the mutex was being locked, and

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:55.723
the closed curly bracket meant that the mutex was unlocked or free.

00:00:55.723 --> 00:01:01.069
In pthreads, this concept is supported explicitly, there is a separate pthread

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:05.660
mutex lock operation and a separate pthread mutex unlock operation.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.270
Whatever code appears between these two statements will correspond to

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.660
the critical section.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.200
As an example, remember that in the thread introductory lecture, we implemented

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.050
the safe_insert operation using Birrell's construct in the following way.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.740
With pthreads, the same safe_insert operation would be implemented as follows,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.050
we would be explicitly be locking and

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.880
unlocking the mutex around the insert operation in the shared list, my_list,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.750
and also note that the mutex is of appropriate type, pthread_mutex type.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.440
Pthread supports a number of other mutex related operations.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.600
Several of them are worth highlighting.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.050
First, mutexes must be explicitly initialized.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.220
This operation allocates a mutex data structure and also specifies its behavior.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.080
It takes as an argument a mutex attribute variable, and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.860
this is how we specify the mutex behavior.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.365
By passing now as this argument,

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:08.840
we have an option to specify the default behavior from mutexes, or

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.040
we can set one or more attributes that are associated with mutexes.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.300
For instance, pthreads permits mutexes and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.058
condition variables in general to be shared among processes.

00:02:20.058 --> 00:02:24.960
The default behavior would make a mutex private to a process, so only visible

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.550
among the threads within a process, whereas we can explicitly modify that

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.190
behavior and make sure that the mutex can be shared with other processes.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.253
Another interesting operation is pthread_mutex_trylock.

00:02:38.253 --> 00:02:43.530
Unlike the lock operation which will block the calling thread if the mutex is

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.755
in use, what trylock will end up doing is it will check the mutex,

00:02:48.755 --> 00:02:53.470
and if it is in use, it will actually return immediately, and

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.270
it will notify the calling thread that the mutex is not available.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.050
If the mutex is free,

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.830
trylock will result in the mutex successfully being clocked.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.130
But if the mutex is locked, trylock will not block the calling thread.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.550
This gives the calling thread an option to go and do something else and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.310
perhaps come back a little bit later to check if the mutex is free.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.840
Also, you should make sure that you free up any pthread related data structures,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.850
and for mutex, for instance, you have the mutex destroy operation.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.910
These are just some of the operations pthread support from mutexes.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.760
The ones we described here are enough to get your started with pthreads, and you

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.460
can always refer to the pthreads documentation for information on the others.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.920
In the previous lesson, we mentioned a number of common pitfalls where it

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.780
comes to writing multithreaded programs.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.790
A few that are worth mentioning in the context of

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.500
pthread mutexes include the following.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.910
Shared data should always be accessed through a single mutex.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.120
This is such a frequent error that it's worth reiterating.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.620
Next, the mutex scope must be visible to all threads.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.460
Remember, a mutex cannot be defined as a private variable to a single thread.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.890
Including main, you must declare all of your mutexes as global variables.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.230
Another important tip is to globally order the locks.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.920
Once we establish an order between the locks,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.839
basically between the mutexes in the pthreads program, then for all threads we

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:23.860
have to make sure that the mutexes are locked in that particular order.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.800
Remember, we said that this is a way to ensure that dead locks don't happen.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.250
Finally, remember to always unlock a mutex.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.818
Moreover, make sure that you always unlock the correct mutex.

00:04:34.818 --> 00:04:37.180
Given that pthreads has separate lock and

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.430
unlock operations, it can be easy to forget the unlock, and

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.550
compilers will not necessarily tell you that there is a problem with your code.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.680
So you have to make sure that you keep track of your locks and unlocks.
