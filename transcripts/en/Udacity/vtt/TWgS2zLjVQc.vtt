00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.160
So think about these special occasions you really like to celebrate. New Years

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.168
Eve, your birthday or just going to a nice restaurant with your friends. So

00:00:09.168 --> 00:00:13.626
your food comes along, you know, maybe turkey, mashed potatoes, gravey. You eat

00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:20.565
it up, it's very good and you get full. Okay then dessert comes along. You know

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:27.226
apple pie, pecan pie, ice cream, whatever. And all of a sudden you have room

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:31.699
for that, so what's going on is your brain has, sends different signals, for

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:38.580
savory like the turkey and sweet like the pecan pie. So you maybe full for the

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.890
savory stuff but you still have room for that sweet pecan pie.
