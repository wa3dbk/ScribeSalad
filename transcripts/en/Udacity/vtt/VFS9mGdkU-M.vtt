00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.977
Well, you can see that negative 2.59 is less than the z critical negative 1.96

00:00:05.977 --> 00:00:12.757
at the alpha level of 0.05. Since its in this critical region, we can say that

00:00:12.757 --> 00:00:18.388
it is unlikely to have gotten a mean engagement score of 7.13. However, this

00:00:18.388 --> 00:00:23.335
mean engagement score does fall in the critical region. However, there is

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:27.678
evidence that my singing made students less engaged. Perhaps I should just

00:00:27.678 --> 00:00:31.964
stick to talking when I teach a lesson. And we can also say that a mean

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:38.676
engagement score of 7.13 is significant at probably less then 0.05. The

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:43.574
probability of getting an egagement score this far from the mean in either

00:00:43.574 --> 00:00:49.342
direction is less than 0.05. That's basically what that means when we do a 2

00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:54.694
tailed test. So let's say we got a sample mean that is about here. When we

00:00:54.694 --> 00:01:00.831
determine whether or not this sample mean is significant at 0.05. We want to

00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:05.211
know if a probability of obtaining a sample mean this far from the mean of

00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:11.660
means is less than 0.05. And it doesn't matter what direction. So if we have

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.259
this z score, the probability of getting a z score that far below or above the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.220
mean is the area here and here.
