00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.800
So, how can we tie this to our graph? Well, the train track is in one piece.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.440
The train can't just jump from station to station, because it can't leave this

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.676
track. Similarly, all of the graphs that we've looked at so far are also in one

00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:18.362
piece, with no breaks. When a graph is like this one, and has no brakes in it.

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:21.848
But, it's, rather, one piece connecting two points together. What can we say

00:00:21.848 --> 00:00:25.418
about the range of that function? So, looking at this graph over here in

00:00:25.418 --> 00:00:29.588
particular. What numbers can we say are in the range of this function? Does it

00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:34.400
only contain the numbers, negative 8 and 4? Does it contain all of the integers

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.377
between negative 8 and 4? Does is span the entire interval from negative 8 to

00:00:38.377 --> 00:00:43.268
4, but doesn't include those end points? Does it span that entire interval and

00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:47.630
include the points negative 8 and 4? Or does it contain all the real numbers?

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.423
Please pick what you think is the best answer.
