00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.450
So the upshot of the logical protection domain is the ability to extend SPIN

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.700
to include operating system services and make that all part of the same

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.770
hardware address space, so no border

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.610
crossing between the services or the mechanisms

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.130
provided by SPIN. So here is one example where all these system services are

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.210
implemented as protection domain and using create, resolve and

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.770
combine. We've created all these services as logical extensions

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.140
of SPIN. Here is another extension living on top

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.750
of the same hardware, concurrently with the first

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.010
extension. And as you see, each of these mounds represent

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.700
a completely different operating system. And each

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.540
of these mounds may have their own

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.750
subsystems for the same functionality. For instance,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.050
this process uses memory manager two. This

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.050
process uses memory manager one. Both of

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.110
them implement the same functionality. But very

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.460
differently, hopefully, to cater to the needs

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.990
of the applications that need those services.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.925
But they may also have common

00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:23.560
subsystems. For example, the network protocol stack,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.160
may be shared by both extensions that live on top the same hardware framework.
