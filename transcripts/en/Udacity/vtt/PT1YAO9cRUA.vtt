00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.434
And the answer is 1. Since the 2n's of a polynomial function with an odd

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:09.514
degree, like this cubic one right here, need to point in opposite directions.

00:00:09.514 --> 00:00:13.540
Either one pointing to negative infinity, and the other to positive infinity,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.353
or vice versa. The curve has to pass through the x-axis at least once.
