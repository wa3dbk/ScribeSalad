00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.841
The last model of motivation that we're going to discuss was developed by

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:09.321
Abraham Maslow. Maslow developed the model of motivation in which he termed the

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:14.244
Hierarchy of needs. This Hierarchy of needs states that we progress or move

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:19.300
onto higher needs once the more basic needs are relatively well satisfied.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.854
Otherwise, we stay concerned with the more basic level needs. Here. Look at

00:00:23.854 --> 00:00:27.892
this model. For example, if we're dying of hunger, we're not concerned with

00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:33.834
beauty or aesthetics. But only with getting food. At the most basic level of

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:38.944
needs, we need to fill our physiological needs. These are the things such as

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:43.575
the need for food, water, oxygen. Or even an adequate body temperature. These

00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:47.044
are our basic needs in order to survive. And once we have our physiological

00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:50.516
needs met we can move on to the next level of the pyramid and that's a need for

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:55.403
safety and security. Safety needs are things such as having security,

00:00:55.403 --> 00:00:59.289
protection, stability and also not being exposed to things such as terrorism or

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:06.366
fighting. On the third level. Is our need for love and belongingness. According

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.822
to Maslow, the third level includes things such as our desire to belong to our

00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:15.018
family or belong to our social groups. We'll discuss the need for belonging in

00:01:15.018 --> 00:01:19.050
more detail a little later on in the lesson. The next level is our self-esteem

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.459
needs. And this is the need to appreciate ourselves and our worth. Here, we

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.770
want to be appreciated and respected by others. Finally, at the top of the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.610
Hierarchy of needs is self-actualization, or the inherent drive to realize

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.298
one's full potential or one's abilities in life. But because this is at the top

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:41.353
of the hierarchy, it's harder to achieve because all of our other needs need to

00:01:41.353 --> 00:01:43.390
be satisfies first.
