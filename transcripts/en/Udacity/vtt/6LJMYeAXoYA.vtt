00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.757
&gt;From our table here we can see that the quantity x minus four times the quantity

00:00:04.757 --> 00:00:09.356
x plus four is positive, or greater than zero, only when x is either less than

00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:14.200
negative four or greater than positive four. So, these must be the intervals of

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.075
values of x that satisfy our original inequality. Since we now know that x minus

00:00:19.075 --> 00:00:23.737
16 is greater than zero, it satisfied when either x is less than eight of four

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:28.032
or x is greater than four. Can you tell me about the solution set to sort of a

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:32.174
related inequality. X squared minus 16 is less than or equal to 0. Of course,

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:36.122
you can use our table down here for reference. And I'd like you to write the

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:40.612
answer using interval notation. Remember, that involves brackets that are either

00:00:40.612 --> 00:00:44.762
square or round. Two numbers inside and then comas in between those numbers, and

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:48.722
of course, you can combine the brackets differently depending on what you need

00:00:48.722 --> 00:00:49.640
for the interval.
