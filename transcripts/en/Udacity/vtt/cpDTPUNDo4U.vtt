00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.365
Okay, if we take our t value and square it and put that in the numerator, that

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:10.922
is 4. If we take t and square it again, that is a 4 again. And we add our

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:17.080
degrees of freedom we should get 4 over 4 plus 20. That gives us 4 over 24. And

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.350
if we divide 24 into 4 and round to two decimal places, that gives us 0.17 or

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:31.723
17%. Let's try another couple of examples. 4 squared is 16. That goes in the

00:00:31.723 --> 00:00:34.791
numerator. Put 16 again into the denominator, and we're going to add 10 to

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:37.604
that. That gives us 16 over 26. And if we divide 16 by 26 and round it two

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:47.135
decimals, that gives us 0.62 or 62%. Third example, well, 1 squared is 1. That

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:55.556
goes in the numerator. Put that again in the denominator. We're to add 9 to

00:00:55.556 --> 00:01:04.806
that. That gives us 1 over 10, which is .10, which is 10%. So, in each of these

00:01:04.806 --> 00:01:10.379
examples, we see how to get r squared. And I convert it from a proportion to a

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:14.372
percentage and now let's now interpret that. For number one, we'd say that we

00:01:14.372 --> 00:01:17.544
can explain 17% of the variation in our deep ended variable by knowing our

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:24.096
other variable. Here we can explain 62%. Here we can explain 10%. Obviously

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:27.819
we're explaining more variation in this example than the other two.
