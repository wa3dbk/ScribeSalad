00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now that you've seen how easy it is to build a random tester,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I hope that you build many of them in the future and most of the rest of this course is going to be spent

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
going into more details about how we build effective random testers.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But before we do that, what I'd like to do is address an issue that eventually confronts

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
almost everybody who works on random testing, which is that random testing gets no respect.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And what I mean by that is people often think that it's a really stupid way to test software.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For example, one of the classic references on software testing

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is a book called The Art of Software Testing.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In this book, the author talks about random testing and here's what he has to say.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"Probably the poorest methodology of all is random random input testing...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What we look for is a set of thought processes that allow one to select

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a set of test data more intelligently."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So basically what Myers is saying is random input testing is not a way that allows one

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to select a set of test data intelligently.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And so my opinion and this is after writing at least a dozen testers

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
what he should've said is something like what we look for in testing is a set of thought processes

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that allow one to randomly generate a set of test data more intelligently.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And so what we can do is get around this fact that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
testing requires thought about the software under test.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But my experience and the experience of a lot of other people is that if we think hard

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
about a random test case generator that's as good or better in many cases

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
than thinking hard about generating the test cases themselves.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So another classic piece of work is a book chapter called Random Testing by Richard Hamlet.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And in this chapter he says, "Most criticism of random testing is really objection

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to misapplication of the method using inappropriate input distribution."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And so what Hamlet is really talking about here is the input validity problem

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that we've just been discussing and what he means is that if you ignore the input validity problem

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and you just test randomly using completely random garbage, you're going to get a bad

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
impression of the method because it's not going to work very well.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You're going to experience a phenomenon that we talked about a little bit ago

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
where all of the test cases get rejected by very early parts of the software under test.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And so I would actually say what Hamlet said a little bit differently.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Most criticism in random testing is really objection to random testing done badly.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So let's take a look at one more quote.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So what the author of Testing for Zero Bugs has to say is, "The introduction of random testing

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
practically eliminated user bug reports on released back ends.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
To our amazement, RIG (and this is their test case generator) was able to find over half of all bugs

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
reported by customers on the code generator in just one night of run time."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And so this clearly was written by somebody who did a really good job creating a random tester.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And also probably applied in the domain where random testing happened to work really well.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The rest of this Testing for Zero Bugs is worth reading as well,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and we will include a link to that in the supplemental material for the course.
