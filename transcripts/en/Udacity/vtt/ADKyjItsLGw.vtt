00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.880
To summarize then, concepts can be of many different kinds. Fro very formal,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.820
concepts, like Axiomatic concepts, to less formal concepts,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.020
like Exemplar concepts. Of course, we can, if we want less formal concepts,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.155
like exemplar concepts, philosophers often talk about concepts called qualia,

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:26.390
Q-U-A-L-I-A. Qualia for the raw sensations that we may get from our sensors. And

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.120
example of qualia is, bitterness. I'm sure you've come across some bitter fruit,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.590
some time or the other. And you can even taste it, inside your mouth right now,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.870
if you wanted to. But it's very hard to communicate what a qualia is to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.010
anyone else, what. Your notion of a genesis to anyone else.
