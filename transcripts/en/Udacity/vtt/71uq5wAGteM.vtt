So what did you put for client ID here? What we want is a client ID of the

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.590
application that wanted to us the backend API. And

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.570
the app that wants to use the backend API

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.110
is dev-desserts and its client ID is 123devdes. So

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.530
hopefully that's what you put. The main thing I

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.110
want to get across is that in this course,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.370
our client, web UI and our backend API are

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.260
all in the same application. But they don't have to be. But

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.230
you do have to always authorize the client to use the backend API.
