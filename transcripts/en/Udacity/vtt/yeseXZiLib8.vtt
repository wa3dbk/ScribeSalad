00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.434
This isn't an algorithm because the procedure doesn't always terminate. Let's

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:10.674
try running it on the example I gave. Initially, it's not an order. So, Robby

00:00:10.674 --> 00:00:16.590
would locate the first two bricks that don't match and swap them. Now, they're

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.160
still not in order. So again, Robbie would find the first pair of blocks that

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.030
doesn't match. And swap them. We're now back exactly where we started. If

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.730
Robbie keeps doing the same thing, again and again, he'll always end up right

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.385
back where he started. The bricks will never end up in order. So this is not an

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:37.750
algorithm. Robbie's batteries will run out before this algorithm finishes, or

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.560
all the batteries and generators in the world would run out before this process

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.213
finishes. He will never finish.
