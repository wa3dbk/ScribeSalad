It turns out we multiply the exponents together, this choice. Great work if you

00:00:04.408 --> 00:00:08.901
identified the pattern. If this question gave you some trouble, go back and look

00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:13.181
at the last slide. You'll notice that the powers on the left will multiply to

00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:15.003
give you the powers on the right.
