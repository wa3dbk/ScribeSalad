00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.740
So adding colors wouldn't increase the latency, but it would

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.450
increase the bandwidth. What bandwidth means, is the amount of information

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.630
that can be transmitted per unit time. And it doesn't matter

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.860
if there's a start-up time. Right, the start-up time is the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.890
latency. That's how long it takes to start sending a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.230
message across. That's how long it takes for the start of

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.620
the message to be received. The bandwidth is, once you've got

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.364
some part of the message across, what's the rate that you

00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:28.610
can send information? So, this is going to be measured

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.160
in terms of units of information divided by units

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.320
of time. So bandwidth could be measured in terms

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.120
of bits per second. On the Internet this is

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.110
often measured In Mbps, which is megabits per second

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.140
or million bits per second. I haven't yet explained

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.560
what a bit is, and in order to understand

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.938
information, it's important to understand what a bit is.
