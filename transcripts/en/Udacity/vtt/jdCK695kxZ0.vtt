Hello, and welcome to our first question and answer session.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm Joe, the assistant instructor of the class, and I'm here with Dave, our instructor.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hi, it looks like there's been a lot of activity on the forums

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and some interesting questions to answer, so let's get started

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
looking at some of those questions.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Our first question comes from Insa, who wants to know

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
how many of the questions on the future problem set

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and the final exam will be primarily programming-based questions,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and how many will be primarily mathematics based?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's going to be a mix.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Cryptography is really a branch of mathematics,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so there's a lot of math in crypto,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but we also want to build things, and we are interested in programs

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and the computing aspects of that, so there will be questions that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
either require you to write a program or more often questions where

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to solve them well you probably have to write a program,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but the goal is to solve the question, not to write the program for its own sake.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
There will be a mix.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There will be a few questions on each homework that do involve writing programs.

00:00:52.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Many that don't, though, and those will be more involving the mathematics.
