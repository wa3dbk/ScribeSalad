00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here is one possible design for coding up a solver for these types of problems.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That design would be to write down all the rules of arithmetic

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
in terms of carry digits, in terms of odd and even and so on.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now, that seems like a challenging task.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There's a lot of complexity involved in understanding all the rules about arithmetic.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Even if we figured out everything about addition, there's also subtraction

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and multiplication and other operators.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So what we really want is a short cut that'll allow us to eliminate this complexity.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Let's go back to the back of the envelope

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and see if we can figure out a shortcut.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
One possibility would be to try all possibilities.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There are 10 digits.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
All combinations of digits--all permutations of the digits, rather--

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
would be only 10 factorial,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which I happen to know is about 3 million.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That's not so many.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It seems like it's feasible to try all the possibilities.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's not going to be super quick.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We would rather have this be thousands rather than millions

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
because there seems to be a fair amount of work in substituting in all the letters with digits.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But we can expect to be able to try all millions,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
not within a second, but within about a minute or so.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now we have an approved design, which is we represent our formula as a string,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and we'll use official Python notation here with the double equal sign.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Then we fill in with all permutations of the 10 digits for each of the letter,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and if there's fewer letters, we have to account for that.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
For example, we might substitute a 1 for the Os,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and a 2 for the Ds, and a 3 for the Es, and a 4 for the Vs, and a 5 for the Ns.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Otherwise just copy the equation.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Then evaluate that and check if that's equal to True.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If it is, then we have a solution.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
If it's not, we'll go back and we'll try another combination--

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
maybe 1, 3, 3, and so on.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We'll keep on going through until we find some permutation that works.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
That's the design.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now, let's take an inventory of all the concepts we're going to need.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
First we have equations.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
There's two types of those--the original and the filled-in.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The original has letters. The filled in has digits.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Letters and digits are concepts we have to deal with.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The assignment of a letter to a digit or set of those is also a concept we have to deal with.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I think that's pretty much it.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Maybe one more concept is evaluation or validation

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that the filled in equation is an accurate one.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Now let's come up with some choices to represent each of these concepts.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The original equation can be a string.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The filled-in equation can also be a string.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The letters will be single character strings like D.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
The digits will also be single character strings--like 3.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
The assignment of letters to digits will be some sort of mapping or a table

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that consists of this type of mapping that says D would be replaced by 3 and so on.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It turns out that there is a facility built into Python that's part of strings

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
called the translate function.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We can call the str.translate method in order to enact that type of assignment or substitution.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Then for the evaluation, there is a function called "eval" in Python,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
which takes a string and evaluates it as an expression.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
You may not be that familiar with these last two items, so let's go over them.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Eval is pretty simple.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:07.000
If we asked for eval of the string "2 + 2," then that would give us a value 4.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:21.000
If we asked for eval of the string "2 + 2 == 3," Python would evaluate that

00:05:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
using it's normal rules and tell us that that's equal to False.
