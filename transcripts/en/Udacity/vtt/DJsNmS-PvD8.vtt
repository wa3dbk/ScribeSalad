00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.270
Static data is not all that useful,
I know.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.370
Luckily, you have this content provider
that has the exact data we need.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.460
Let's put these things together.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.340
But wait, we took all this effort and

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.880
sunshine to not run queries
on the main thread.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.600
AsyncTasks, IntentServices, Loaders,
and SyncAdapters were all used.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.410
What can we do here, or
is there even a problem?

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.980
Let's go back to when we added our
app widget provider to the manifest.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.370
The app widget provider class is
actually a thin wrapper around

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.890
one of the basic types of components
on Android, a broadcast receiver.

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:40.105
Broadcast receiver is a short lived
component that receives broadcasts

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:44.875
from other components, or other apps,
through its onReceive method.

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:49.754
App widget provider harnesses
the broadcast sent by the Android system

00:00:49.754 --> 00:00:54.887
provides us with a simpler to use
onUpdate() method among other things.

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:57.387
Turns out the onReceive() method and

00:00:57.387 --> 00:01:01.665
hence our onUpdate() method
get called on the UI thread.

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:04.650
Doing anything that might take a while,
is probably not a good idea.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.890
A very common pattern, one you need to
do more work in response to a broadcast,

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.800
is the broadcast receiver starting
an Intent Service, do to heavy lifting.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.340
Intent Services are great for

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.750
this kind of work because the On Handle
Intent, runs on a Background Thread.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.380
And the service is automatically
stopped once done.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.580
No need to keep the service around
when there's nothing to do.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.800
So we'll write an intense service that
does everything our onUpdate method did

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.870
and change our onUpdate
to CallStartService.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.530
Now, we can use the same technique we
used elsewhere to retrieve data from our

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.450
content provider,
query to retrieve our data,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.350
then extract the information we need.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.840
So now, we can see our app widget
provider is calling our intent service.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.070
Our IntentService is then querying for
the data and getting a response back.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.650
As our AppWidgetProvider is
a broadcast receiver at its core,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.010
our SyncAdapter could send
a data changed broadcast

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.600
to our AppWidgetProvider to update the
widgets exactly when we have new data.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.440
We'll add a new constant
to our SyncAdapter.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.420
Then use that constant as the action for
the broadcast we send out.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.520
Then we'll update our manifest entry for

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.170
the app widget provider to
receive the new action.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.400
Finally to actually handle our message,
we override the onReceive method

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.860
to look for our action and start the
Intent Service to update the widgets.
