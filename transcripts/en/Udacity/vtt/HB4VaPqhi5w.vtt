00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.452
Let's learn one last method to help us solve what may look like a quadratic

00:00:03.452 --> 00:00:09.185
equation. Let's look at the equation x to the fourth minus 13x squared plus 36

00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:14.196
equals 0. This equation is considered to be a pseudo-quadratic equation, or a

00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:18.518
false one. It almost appears to be quadratic, but we really have a fourth power

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:23.740
here. Notice too that we have no odd powers of x. We just have x to the fourth,

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.666
x squared and then no x term, just a constant here. We can change this equation

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:33.995
into a quadratic equation that we can potentially solve. This part would be

00:00:33.995 --> 00:00:38.415
quadratic, since we would have something squared minus another something plus a

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:43.605
constant. Notice how the powers on any variable term would be 2 then 1 and then

00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:48.795
0, since there's no variable here. In this first equation, we actually have a

00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:53.122
repeated expression here. When we have an expression that's repeated, we can

00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:56.594
make a substitution for that expression and replace it so we have a simpler

00:00:56.594 --> 00:01:02.258
equation to solve. So what do you think is that repeated expression? What

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:04.260
should we place inside these parentheses?
