00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.340
So I think we'll see zero to nine appear.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.800
Wait a second, this is actually i is less than nine, so

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.210
it's going to exit the loop when i is equal to nine.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.730
So it actually will show zero through eight and there it is.
