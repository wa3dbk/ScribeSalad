In this question, the number of triangles doesn't matter. Since the number of

00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:08.278
vertices lit and the number of pixels lit varies directly with the number of

00:00:08.278 --> 00:00:12.457
triangles. But it's a bit confusing to just think about five triangles. So I

00:00:12.457 --> 00:00:17.034
like to pick a big nice round number. Let's say 100 triangles. 100 triangles

00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:22.260
times 3 vertices per triangle gives 300 vertices. We know that each vertex's

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.024
material calculation will be shared by 5 triangles. So that gives 300 vertices

00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:31.934
divided by 5 triangles that are sharing a vertex. And that gives 60 evals. In

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:36.059
other words, 60 material calculations that are needed. For the fragment shader,

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.128
where we're shading per pixel, there's no sharing. So 100 triangles times 60

00:00:42.128 --> 00:00:47.710
pixels per triangle gives 6,000 evals. In other words, 6,000 material

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.739
calculations we need to do. 6,000 pixel evaluations versus 60 vertex evaluations

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.294
gives a ratio of 100 to 1. As you can see it can be considerably more costly to

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:05.065
evaluate per pixel than per vertex. Note that this doesn't mean that the program

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.900
itself runs 100 times slower. There are mitigating factors and other parts of

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.684
the pipeline can be the bottleneck. Which changes this ratio on practice.
