00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.850
Just touching up some of the code here its fairly simple so

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.840
I'll explain it quickly.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.070
But instead of setting the radius automatically equal to some radius constant.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.750
And setting the fill to the constant color, in this case blue.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.401
We've put an if conditional in our accessor function to

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:24.370
basically make the radius dynamic or dependent on the data.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.050
Again, we're letting the data,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.710
in this case the bound data, represented by d for each circle,

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.730
drive how the visual representation of our graphic is on the screen.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.130
In this case, if the home column correspond to team one or

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.660
team two so the home country, is one team in this game.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.810
So we return the radius.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.700
And what I've set here as the multiplier, again I create a variable earlier on,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.610
so I can have a more dynamic size increase.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.334
In this case, my multiplier is simply set to be 1.5,

00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:05.657
which has the effect of creating your radius of 4.5.

00:01:05.657 --> 00:01:08.040
If you want it exactly five.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.570
I could simply return five instead of the radius.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.550
But this multiplier let me play around in a more flexible way

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.820
with the visual representation.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.960
And a very similar process for the color.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.150
We simply check whether the home team is involved, and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.880
then return either red or blue.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.230
Since we've copied a lot of the code for

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.140
each of these, we could actually abstract this further into a common function

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.080
to basically return true or false of whether or not the home team's playing.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.400
And then possibly pass in two different values.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.140
Again, for sake of clarity I kept it verbose.
