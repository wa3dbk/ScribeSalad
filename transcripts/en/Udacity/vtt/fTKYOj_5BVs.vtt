Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Now, if any one

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.460
of these two scenarios occurs, the program that we wrote will

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.960
throw an error. We call this error an exception.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.970
I want you to put a pin in this thought as we

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.200
will return to this idea in the later lessons of

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.640
this course. Okay, so we are back at our code again.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.560
And now I'm curious to see where the different functions of

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.360
OS like listdir and rename are coming from. Let's find out.
