00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
You might remember from the second unit that we can draw a matrix like this.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.220
Where here in the columns we have what a deterministic RAM can do,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.010
and here we have what a non-deterministic RAM can do.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.530
In the rows we have polynomial time and exponential time.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.160
You already know 2 complexity classes that go into here.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.090
One is P, and the other one is NP.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.660
There is actually also names for these classes up here.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.770
This one is commonly referred to as EXP or exptime.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.090
You can guess what that stands for.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.140
This one over here, guess what, is called nexptime.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.150
Since we are this far in the unit, here is a little challenging quiz for you.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.140
Because you can actually arrange all of these complexity classes here

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.140
in a sort of hierarchy.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.160
Meaning that, for example, all problems that fall into this complexity class here

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.920
automatically also fall into this complexity class here and this complexity class here.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.470
It's basically a hierarchy or containment of the complexity classes.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.010
I am going to give all of the complexity classes over here a number. 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.740
What I would like you to do is to enter the number of the respective complexity class

00:01:10.740 --> 99:59:59.000
so that you have built this hierarchy over here.
