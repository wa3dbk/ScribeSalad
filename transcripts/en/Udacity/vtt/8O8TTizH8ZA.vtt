00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm trying it out and see what happens.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Before it was a -3, 2, 5, 7, and now the first position is completely unchanged.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'll explain to you in a second why.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The third one went from 5 to 5.5, and the landmark went down from 7 to 6.8.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Graphically, this guy becomes larger than 5, and this landmark even shifts a little bit

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to the left to make these two things closer together than they were before

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when they had a separation distance of 2.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now this picture doesn't really explain it well, because it's a 2D picture,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but in 1D that's exactly what's happening.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Also interesting is the initial position is unchanged.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
These are the correct answers.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, I would be blown away if you guessed them correctly.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The reason why the initial position doesn't change is the only information we have

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
about the absolute coordinate location is the very first initial position anchor

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that we said was to be -3.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
None of the relative rubber bands change the fact that we need this guy to be -3.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
A relative change between these 2 things over here

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
means the rubber band is different, but it's a relative thing.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This is the only absolute constraint we put in.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Clearly the absolute location of the first position doesn't change.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The reason why becomes larger than 5 is--well, think about rubber bands.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Our landmark is around 7. We believe to be at position 5 in the noise-free case.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We just put a tighter rubber band between them. It's not 2 anymore; it's now 1.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That means we are inclined to move the landmark and this position closer together.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
That's exactly what happens.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If you go to this solution over here, the final position becomes 5.5. It's now 5.5.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The landmark becomes 6.875 instead of 7.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now, this is the case where the rubber bands don't add up.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This is one of the places where Graph Slam is just magical.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Before everything added up, but we have cycles in these structures.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
These cycles might not added up, because we have noise and motion,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
noise and measurements

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
What our method does by computing this thing--omega to -1 times xi--

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
we find the best solution to the relaxation of those rubber bands.

00:02:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That, to me, is sheer magic.
