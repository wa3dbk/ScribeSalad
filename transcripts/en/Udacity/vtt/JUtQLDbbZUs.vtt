00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Of course the percentage support for candidate A is 55%.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
To compute the margin of error, we will use the following formula.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
1.96 the quartile from the normal at 97.5% times the square root of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
P times 1 minus P equals n and substituting n and evaluating this expression

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.999
the square root of 0.550.45/1001.96 is equal to 9.75%.
