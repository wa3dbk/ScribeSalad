00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.710
Finally, we have group therapies and support groups. Group therapy is a

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.328
therapeutic setting in which several people who share a common problem all meet

00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:12.365
regularly with a therapist to help themselves and to help each other. These

00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:17.080
groups tend to be very structured. Some group therapies, for example, offer

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.980
training and learning to overcome social anxiety disorder and others may use

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.312
cognitive behavioral therapy to treat eating disorders. Now, there are other

00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:30.541
groups that are less structured in the therapeutic context. And these are

00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.766
support groups. These are meetings of people who share a common situation

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:40.150
whether it's a disorder, disease, or even coping with an ill family member.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.606
Support groups are widely available and can be categorized in terms of their

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:47.856
focus. For example, there's support groups for eating disorders, substance

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:52.505
abuse, the treatment of OCD, even with coping with the loss of a loved one.

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:56.927
Alcoholics Anonymous and other substance abuse groups are considered support

00:00:56.927 --> 00:01:00.889
groups and these are available all over the world.
