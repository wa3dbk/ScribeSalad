00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.235
To figure out each of these points, we just need to look at the point above on

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:08.760
f and switch the order of the coordinates. So instead of 0, negative 1, we'll

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.163
have negative 1,0. Instead of 1,2, we'll have 2,1. And instead of negative 1,

00:00:14.163 --> 00:00:17.809
negative 4, we'll have negative 4, negative 1.
