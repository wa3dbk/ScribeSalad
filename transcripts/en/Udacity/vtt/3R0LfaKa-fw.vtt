One way to do it, would be to look up here at the original table and count the

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:10.920
number of students who are either 20, 21, 22, all the way to 39. But that would

00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:16.385
be really time consuming. Instead, we know that all of these should add to 50

00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:21.955
because that's the total number of students in our sample. 19 plus 5 plus 5, is

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:31.407
29, and 50 minus 29 is 21. So in other words, we did 50 minus 19 plus 5 plus 5

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.433
in parentheses.
