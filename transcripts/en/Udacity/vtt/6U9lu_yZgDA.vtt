00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.270
I've created a JSON file with data for
each of the menu items.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.350
These files are in the instructor notes.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.900
The process to get a menu item's data is
almost exactly the same as what we just

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.816
did with menu.

00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:17.036
When the URL is item/ some item name,
Ember calls the item route.

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:20.255
Again, we use the model
hook to fetch the data.

00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:22.965
But how will Ember
know which item to get?

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:26.385
The item will be stored in item_name.

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:28.680
The model hook is passed
a params object and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.350
we can get the item name
off of that object.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.580
Now let's update the item template.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.400
Just like updating the menu template,
we need to replace the static info

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.230
with the dynamic data
provided by the JSON file.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.410
Remember that the data returned from
the model hook is stored in a model

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.910
variable.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.480
And now we can finally
see the other menu items.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.880
Awesome.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.650
Have you noticed that clicking back and
forth, though, shows us a blank page for

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.760
a few seconds?

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.020
Let's fix that.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.650
The problem is that we're using
an anchor tag to link to specific URLs

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.890
instead of letting Ember
manage the URLs for us.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.599
Ember provides us a template
helper called link-to.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.670
The link-to helper needs to know
which route it should link to.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.070
We want this link to
link to the item route.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.040
So item should go here.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.290
The item route needs to have an item, so

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.880
we need to give one to
the link-to helper.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.050
One thing that would trip me up in the
beginning is that this one needs quotes,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.970
but this one doesn't, since it's
using the local item variable.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.360
Using link-to with nested
routes is very similar.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.530
Because the nutrition route
is nested inside item,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.290
the route we need to reference in
the link-to helper is item.nutrition.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.070
We don't need to worry about which item
to use, because to display the nutrition

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.120
template, we'll already
be on this item page.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.670
Ember knows that and
handles that for us.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.700
For more information
on the link-to helper,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.890
check the link in the instructor notes.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.010
Now there are no page refreshes and
all transitions are smooth and

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.460
instantaneous.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.720
And what's cool is that the back
button works with all of this too.
