00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.240
One of the most important abstract
data structures today is a graph.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.450
Graph analysis is everywhere.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.220
Every day, people are analyzing
physical structures, like buildings and

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.780
bridges, electrical circuits,
social networks, just to name a few.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.430
Now, this lesson introduces
parallel graph algorithms for

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.330
one especially important primitive.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.125
It's called a a breadth first search,
or BFS for short.

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:27.836
[SOUND] That's breadth as in wide.

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.239
This kernel is so important that
there's even a ranking of the world's

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.820
supercomputers based on how
quickly they can do a BFS.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.220
Now there's another lesson to look at
supercomputer scale algorithms for BFS.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.150
But in this one you'll consider
a practical algorithm for

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.280
the Dynamic Multithreading Model.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.110
So with that quick intro,
let's go explore!
