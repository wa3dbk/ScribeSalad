00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.256
So, just like when adding fractions, we start out by finding the LCD or the

00:00:04.256 --> 00:00:08.576
lowest common denominator. Next, we multiplied each of these fractions by the

00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:12.490
missing factors of the lowest common denominator. That was the same for our

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.226
actual numbers. Now, we're ready for the last step. Let's find the actual

00:00:16.226 --> 00:00:20.188
fractions that are equivalent and then find the sum. So, what are these two

00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:24.358
equivalent fractions? And then, what I want you to do is to find the sum of the

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:27.463
two fractions and put that here. Good luck.
