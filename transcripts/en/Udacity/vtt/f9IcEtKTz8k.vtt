00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.080
Okay. So now that we have seen a little example of

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.970
how the ROB-based processor works, let's look at a ROB timing example. So this

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.710
is how we can figure out what happens when without actually tracking everything,

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.840
like in the previous, very busy video. Here we have some instructions.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.890
Here we have what latencies of various units are.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.430
And now we're just going to track when instructions are issued,

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.420
when they begin executing, when do they write the result, broadcast it, and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.740
when do they commit. And here we will put some comments that kind of, you know,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.030
help us tell what happened when and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.340
why. This time, let's make it a bit different from before. First,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.450
our processor will free our reservation station when the result is broadcast,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.210
not when we actually dispatch the instruction. This can happen for

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.940
example, because a processor is doing something speculative and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.540
it wants to keep the instruction until it's really sure that you know,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.350
the instructions should have executed. So some of the processors actually do

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.830
this. So, let's try an example with this. The processor can still issue,

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.240
capture a result and dispatch the instruction in the same cycle. But

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.870
the execution will again happen in the following cycle. This is just like

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.680
the previous processors. And again, we have the add take one cycle,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.800
the multiplication takes ten cycles and divide takes 40 cycles.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.070
So let's see. Well, in cycle one, we will try to issue the first instruction and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.730
nothing else can happen because we do not have any other instructions in

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.130
the processor. This instruction, of course, being the first one that we know

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.930
does not depend on anything, so it will being executing in the second cycle.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.130
It is a divide instructions, it takes 40 cycles to do it.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.550
So, 40 cycles after this one, we will try to write the result, and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.420
that happens in cycle 42. And commit will happen in the following cycle,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.060
because this is the very first instruction, so we can just say 43 here.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.060
Now let's go to this multiplication. Once we have some instructions in

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.100
the processor, we have to start worrying about reservation stations and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.910
ROB entries and so on, and we haven't said how many ROB entries we have, but

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.830
let's say we have a lot of ROB entries. However, we still have two divide

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.500
multiply reservation stations and three add subtract reservations stations.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.610
So now, one of our reservation stations for divide and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.350
multiply is busy between cycles one and 42. There is, however,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.070
another one so this multiplication can be issued in the following cycle. So

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.310
it will issue in cycle two. When can it execute? Well, it uses R5 and R6.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.900
This doesn't use R3, so it can actually execute in the very following cycle.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.255
So we will star executing it here, takes ten cycles, so

00:02:38.255 --> 00:02:43.650
it will broadcast the result in cycle 13. And when will we commit?

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.660
Well, we cannot commit in cycle 14. Now, we have to wait for

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.130
both the previous instruction to commit N for us to have a result, so

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.065
really we will commit in cycle 44. Now let's look at this add here.

00:02:55.065 --> 00:03:00.697
It's using R7 and R8, so it will be executing right after it issues.

00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:04.460
We have ADDand subtract reservation stations, remember we have

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.020
three separate reservation stations for that. So we will issue in cycle three,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.470
start execution in cycle four, takes only one cycle so we will write the result

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.760
in cycle five, and now when do we commit this instruction in cycle 45.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.630
Now things become a little bit more interesting because this multiplication.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.330
Wants to issue in cycle four. Remember we are issuing instructions in order,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.030
we have reached this instruction in cycle four, we want to issue it. However,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.410
we need a multiplication and divide reservation station for that. And we free

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.820
reservation stations when we broadcast, not when we dispatch this processor.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.420
So we already have in cycle two both of the reservation stations used.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.210
The first available one will become at cycle 13.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.950
So basically we only cycle 14 we can actually issue this instruction. So

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.600
this instruction was waiting to issue, but couldn't because there was no

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.200
free reservation station. So let's kind of note this. So

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.410
this is just kind of to note that basically we have been delayed in our issue

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.170
because of the needing the reservation station. We're using results of R1 and

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.820
R3. So we have to wait for the multiplication and ADD before we can execute.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.900
But those are results having broadcast in cycles 13 and five, so in cycle 15,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.720
which is when we can try to execute, we can. If we manage to issue in cycle

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.050
four, we will still have to wait until cycle 14 here because of cycle 13 here.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.800
So pretty much, our result will be broadcast in cycle 13.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.040
We will be able to dispatch only in 13, we would be executing in 14. Because we

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.370
also needed to wait for a reservation station, we couldn't issue until cycle 14,

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.760
so we can only execute in cycle 15. It's a multiplication instruction, so

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.120
it's going to try to broadcast the result in cycle 25 and we will be able to

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.092
commit it in cycle 46. Now let's look at this attract instruction.

00:04:58.092 --> 00:05:02.010
If it's going to try to issue in cycle 15 we have to issue in order.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.470
So although we could have issued this instruction in cycle four as far as,

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.517
you know, dependencies are concerned, because we couldn't have

00:05:10.517 --> 00:05:14.510
issue this instruction in cycle three, four, five if everything was okay. And

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.760
there was a free reservation station at the time here.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.950
But remember, we have to issue instructions in order. Because of that, this will

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.690
issue in cycle 15, and we will now grab another reservation station in the ADD,

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.110
subtracting. So now what happens is we need to figure out when do we execute?

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.478
We need R1 and R5, the R1 comes from this multiplication.

00:05:36.478 --> 00:05:40.320
The R5 is already available because none of them are producing it.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.120
The R1 here becomes available after this result is written. So

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.130
in cycle 25, we grab the value we need. And then in cycle 26,

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.290
we begin executing. It's a subtract. It's going to finish in cycle 27.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:01.710
And it's going to commit in cycle 47, not because of this, but because of this.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.707
And finally let's look at this ADD here. It's going to issue in cycle 16.

00:06:06.707 --> 00:06:11.032
Execution will begin when R4 and R2 are available.

00:06:11.032 --> 00:06:16.070
R4 is available in cycle 27, but R2 is available only cycle 42.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:22.190
So we will dispatch in cycle 42 and begin executing in cycle 43.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.740
We will write our result one cycle after that. And we will commit in cycle 48.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.300
And that concludes our discussion. Now, here you want to make a note, for

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.040
example, that the issue has been delayed because of reservation stations. And

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.050
for these instructions, for example here, you may want to note that execution

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.850
has been delayed because of R2. Just so that if you, on an exam or something,

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.690
if you slightly mess this up, if you made these notes at least whoever is

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.700
grading this will be able to follow, you know, what went wrong and you know,

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.900
what was your real mistake, and what was just a consequence of that mistake.
