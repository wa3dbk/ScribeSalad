00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.790
Writing to a file by a client is fairly

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.220
straightforward. What the client is doing is actually aggregating

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.420
all the writes that is going on into this

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.770
Log Segment Data Structure, which is in its memory.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.450
And at some point, it decides that it wants

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.440
to flush this Log Segment. And put it on

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.250
the disk. And when it decides to do that,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.940
it knows the Stripe Group, this particular Log Segment

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.070
it belongs to, and so it is going to take this Log Segment and stripe it on the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.130
Storage Servers that are part of the Stripe

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.560
Group. So once it does this write to its

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.120
Stripe Group. The client will notify the manager

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.420
on the lock segments that are being flushed to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.120
the disc so that the manager has up-to-date information

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.450
about the status of the files it manages. So

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.040
XFS is a research prototype of a Distributed

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.650
File System. There have been other instances of

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.240
Distributed File Systems such as. The Android File

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.500
System and the Coder File System that were

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.450
built at CMU and in fact the Android File System served a community of Users in

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.130
the CMU campus in a little lesson we

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.440
will return to discussing Distributed File Systems again.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.950
Specifically we'll look at Andrew File System and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.570
discuss the issue of security and privacy for

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.940
User Files in a Distributed System. But I

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.100
want to leave you with some closing thoughts on the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.080
Exophus File System. First of all, Log based

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.880
striping, and particularly sub-setting the Storage Servers over

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.890
which you'll stripe the Log. That's a Technical

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.580
Innovation. The second Technical Innovation is combining Cooperative Caching

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.290
with Dynamic Management of Data and Metadata.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.380
And the last technical nugget is the distributive

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.060
Log cleaning, making sure that the responsibility

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.180
for cleaning up the Logs on the Disk

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.270
is not. Left to one Node, but

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.870
it is actually distributed and especially taking advantage

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.140
of the fact that the clients, who are

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.670
the mutators for the file system, meaning they

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.740
are the guys that are writing to the file system, they can keep a count of the

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.880
changes that they are making. To the Log Segments

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.610
and use that information in the Log Cleaning effectively.
