00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Evans] So we've reached the end of Unit 1.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let me remind you what we've covered.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We covered symmetric cryptosystems and introduced the terminology

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and definitions we need to talk about encryption.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In particular, we know what it means for a cryptosystem to be correct--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that encryption and decryption are indeed inverses.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Defining security is a much trickier thing, and we talked about ways we could define security

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
for a symmetric cryptosystem.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We introduced the one-time pad, which is a very simple but important cryptosystem,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and it's all based on using the XOR operation.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
As long as we have a perfectly random key that's as long as the message,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the one-time pad gives us perfect security.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We looked at a formal way to define what a perfect cipher means

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and prove that the one-time pad has that property.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We also saw that in order to be perfect, a cipher has to be impractical--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that the number of keys has to exceed the number of messages,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and that means that every cipher that's used in practice is potentially breakable.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We saw one very interesting example of that with how the Allies at Bletchley Park

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
were able to break the Lorenz cipher.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We talked about modern symmetric ciphers which take advantage of computing power,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
following many of the same principles of the historical mechanical ciphers like Lorenz

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but using modern computing power and new ideas about how to scramble data

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to produce much more confusion and make things much more challenging for cryptanalysis

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
even when attackers have access to the huge amounts of computing power

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
available today.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I hope you enjoyed Unit 1 and have a good understanding

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
of some of the theory behind symmetric ciphers and how they're constructed.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In Unit 2 we'll look at how to actually use symmetric ciphers

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to solve problems like sending a message securely between 2 parties

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
over an insecure channel like the Internet

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and being able to use symmetric ciphers to play games online

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and to do important things like managing passwords.

00:01:54.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Hope to see everyone back for Unit 2.
