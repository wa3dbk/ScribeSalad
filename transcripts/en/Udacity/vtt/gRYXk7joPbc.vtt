00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.590
Another important technique in
fine tuning the experience for

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.400
assistive technology users
involves ensuring that

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.120
only the relevant parts of the page
are exposed to assistive technology.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.400
There are several ways to ensure that a
section of the dom does not get exposed

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.610
to accessibility APIs or
is exposed only to accessibility APIs.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.490
Firstly, anything which is explicitly
hidden will also not be included

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.025
in the accessibility tree.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:29.139
So anything which has a visibility
hidden, or display none CSS style.

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:31.091
Or uses the HTML5 hidden attribute,

00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:34.830
will also be hidden from
assistive technology users.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.720
However an element which is
not visually rendered, but

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.920
not explicitly hidden, is still
included in the accessibility tree.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.060
One common technique is to include
screen reader only text in an element

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.751
which absolutely
positioned far off screen.

00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:51.864
Of those we have seen,
it's also possible to provide

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:54.986
screen reader only text via
an aria label attribute.

00:00:54.986 --> 00:00:56.348
Or an aria labeled by or

00:00:56.348 --> 00:01:01.760
aria describedby attribute referencing
element which is otherwise hidden.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.970
The instructor notes have a link to some
more information on providing screen

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.630
reader only text.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.380
Finally, aria provides a mechanism for
excluding content from assistive

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.877
technology which is not visually hidden
in the form of an aria-hidden attribute.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.600
Applying this attribute to an element
effectively removes it and

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.520
all of its descendants from
the accessibility tree.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.386
With the exception of any element which
is referred to via an aria labeledby or

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.910
aria describedby attribute.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.700
For example, in an online slide deck
you might need to have next and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.530
previous slides pre rendered and
ready to slide in.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.299
But not make them visible to users
who are viewing the deck via

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.352
assistive technology,
until they're all the way on the screen.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:43.129
