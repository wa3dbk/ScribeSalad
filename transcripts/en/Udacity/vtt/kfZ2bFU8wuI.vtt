00:00:01.246 --> 00:00:06.590
I will teach you how do you use one
such bill tool which is called Grant and

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.150
I'm going to help you
get started with Grant.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.830
So right now what I have actually cloned
the project into my local depository.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.420
It actually resides inside
the downloads folder.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.210
I'm going to open my terminal and
install something called node js.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.832
Node js is a scalable application that
will help you create all the necessary

00:00:30.832 --> 00:00:36.450
bill tool requirements, all the files
that you need for your optimization.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.510
So right now what I have to do is,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.755
you can go to node JS and
directly install it from here.

00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:49.905
So if you go to the downloads,
you can see

00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:54.825
that you have Windows Installer,
a Mac and you have the Source Code.

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:56.545
So since I'm on a Mac,

00:00:56.545 --> 00:01:01.750
I am going to be installing that
package that is already given to me.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.770
What I'm going to do is I am going
to initialize an npm command

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.570
into my project repository.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.470
So, to initialize npm,
I need a JSON file that will

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.540
actually point me to
the name of the project and

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.760
the dependencies I am giving for
this project.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.518
For example,
you now see my package.json open,

00:01:27.518 --> 00:01:31.466
which I have actually put
inside my root directory.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:36.686
So what package.Json essentially
has is a name for my grant project,

00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:41.562
so I just named it example project,
and I've given it a version.

00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:46.249
This is going to be my first 1.0
version so that is the version number.

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:51.249
And there isn't dependencies
that you have to provide,

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:58.240
which is called depth dependencies which
tells you which bill tool I'm using.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.032
So you have a lot of bill tools, Grunt,
so I'm going to be using Grunt, and

00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:06.333
I have specified the version of Grunt,
4.1 and

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:09.508
above versions are going
to be supported.

00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:15.780
So, right now what I'm going
to do is single npm install.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.374
So I did a pseudo npm install,
just install npm Cmd,

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:24.665
what I do after the npm
install is to run from CLI.

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:29.765
And once that is done what I have
to do is, I have a file called

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:34.662
gruntfile.js, which again
you guys will be creating,

00:02:34.662 --> 00:02:40.885
something where you'll actually
specify all the Grunt modules that you

00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:46.670
are going to be importing to use
Grunt to run specific tasks.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.064
So for instance,
I am going to use an [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:51.064 --> 00:02:56.037
package [LAUGH] that is going
to glittify my JS files.

00:02:56.037 --> 00:03:00.381
[CROSSTALK] Yeah,
that's what you call it, glittify.

00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:04.783
So as you can see, it says
model.sports = functionGrants, so

00:03:04.783 --> 00:03:09.757
this is going to be the grant file
that the Grunt function, it's going to

00:03:09.757 --> 00:03:14.830
take in and it's going to look at
all the tasks that I have defined.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.592
So it says that I am going to build on
this source, which is this JS file, and

00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:25.806
the destination is going to be this
JS file and then I'm going to load

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:31.774
the npm tasks using this package, and
then I'm going to register this task.

00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:36.734
So when I run the Grunt command, it is
supposed to run this [INAUDIBLE] package

00:03:36.734 --> 00:03:41.300
and it is going to give you a minified
version of your JavaScript.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.420
The next step of this would be to
actually install this package.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.170
So, the same dependencies is

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.190
actually going to save the package
name into your Json file.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.787
So, I'm going to copy it, and
what I'll do is I will take re-space

00:04:00.787 --> 00:04:06.501
this with the [INAUDIBLE] 5 package
that I have installed right here.

00:04:06.501 --> 00:04:11.511
And I'm going to replace this name

00:04:11.511 --> 00:04:16.010
here and then give a save give.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.959
So let's see what this returns.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.130
Hopefully this will execute and
it says I have an error.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.540
So it says please try running this
command as a root or an administrator.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.296
But I probably should have
to give pseudo since I am

00:04:34.296 --> 00:04:37.700
authorizing it as the root.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.205
So once I do that, I feel like
Couplify is going to load and

00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:48.960
it looks like Couplify got installed.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.377
I can check this by going into my
package.Json and you can see this here.

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.214
[INAUDIBLE] shows up here.

00:04:56.214 --> 00:05:00.897
After this, ones that I have
actually downloaded the package,

00:05:00.897 --> 00:05:03.420
I just run Grunt from here.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.474
And it's going to take it and
it says running [INAUDIBLE],

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:11.284
one file created,
which should be my minified file.

00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:16.252
So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to navigate inside my JS as you can

00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:20.190
see I have my minified
file that Grunt created.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.819
So as you can see,
you have other packages on Grunt,

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.135
like image minification,
HTML minification,

00:05:29.135 --> 00:05:34.817
JSint of packages, and other ones
that will help you go ahead and

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:40.187
actually making your content and
your website efficient and

00:05:40.187 --> 00:05:42.520
render efficiently-
&gt;&gt; So

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.710
what's the reason to use Grunt, right?

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.613
Like it seems like a fair amount of
work to get set up, doesn't Grunt?

00:05:49.613 --> 00:05:52.173
But then what's the value?

00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:53.400
Why do people do it?

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.730
&gt;&gt; So one thing is Grunt helps
you separate your development and

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.440
production version of code.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.170
So you still get to keep the unminified
code which is very useful for

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.080
development, right.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.810
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Minified code is not readable,

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.170
you're not able to see what
you've actually created, so

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.430
it's going to be very ugly.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.790
You need to unminify it and then use it.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.402
But with Grunt, you can get to
keep your development code and

00:06:20.402 --> 00:06:25.657
produce a set of other code that can
be used to run your website there.

00:06:25.657 --> 00:06:28.103
So that is one reason why
you have to use Grunt-

00:06:28.103 --> 00:06:30.383
&gt;&gt; So given how often we make changes to

00:06:30.383 --> 00:06:34.639
our projects that we might have to
start, when we start a project,

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.240
we want to just get something going.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.180
We iteratively develop,
we incrementally build up.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.876
So each time you can kind of test
your code, you can just run Grunt,

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:46.200
it builds everything.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.756
With your production-level website
codes, you can push it out, it runs, but

00:06:50.756 --> 00:06:54.836
then when you want to make changes,
you just run Grunt again rather than

00:06:54.836 --> 00:06:58.512
having to manually minify every time or
on each of your scripts.

00:06:58.512 --> 00:07:01.502
It manages all of that for
you, so it's worth the setup,

00:07:01.502 --> 00:07:05.117
it's worth doing these stages at
the beginning of your project, and

00:07:05.117 --> 00:07:07.315
then the more you do
it the easier it gets.

00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:11.689
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this file can be used for
your other projects as well,

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:17.125
your package.Json and your Gruntfile.JS,
can be used for your other codes.

00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:20.874
Only that you have to alter the path
that you give inside that you

00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:22.180
are targeting.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.450
But you can use those as a standard for

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.890
all your projects, for
building your production code.
