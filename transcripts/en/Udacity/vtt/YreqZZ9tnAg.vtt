00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.800
For our first asynchronous request,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.720
let's get the Google Maps Street View of the location.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.540
Remember, we want the background of our app to be an image of

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.140
the location where we're thinking about moving.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.410
So, in this case, we've got the White House in the background.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.380
Now, what you're about to perform isn't technically an Ajax request because here

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.940
we're requesting an image asset instead of asking for data like a JSON object.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.080
But, it's important and fun to use services like Street View because they make

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.960
the background more entertaining.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.890
It's actually pretty nice that we're starting with Street View because we

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.780
won't even need to use jQuery to get it to work correctly.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.320
Our page will be requesting an image from Google and,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.140
based on the various parts of the URL.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.540
Google will know what image to serve us.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.050
Essentially, every Street View image has it's own URL endpoint.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.240
And, the URL can contain a string of the street address at that location.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.610
We can see here that the location is set to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.330
Washington D.C..

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.420
And, it's pretty obvious that the image we've got is the White House.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.130
Notice how there is a comma between the street address and the city.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.260
Inside script.js, we can see this function setup called, loadData.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.910
If we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the page,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.030
we can see this jQuery selector for the form entry at the top of the page,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.010
which when somebody hits submit, will run the loadData function.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.440
For this quiz, I want you to us jQuery to collect the street address and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.010
city that users type in here.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.270
Use the address in the city to fill in the end of the URL string here,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.690
that is being used to collect the image.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.660
Now, pin the resulting image to the page inside an image tag, with the class bg

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.250
image, and set the source to the string, similar to the one you see here.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.700
Where the street address and city were collected from the form up at the top.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.440
When you're done, you should be able to type in an address and

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.780
city and see a cool street-view image show up in the background.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.150
Inside the documentation for

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.730
the Street View API, we can figure out the way these images work.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.268
We see that the street-view image comes from a url with this beginning.

00:02:08.268 --> 00:02:11.480
We see maps.googleapis, dot yada, yada, yada.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.020
And then, at the end of it we've got some parameters.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.920
The parameters must have a location, or it must be an id to a specific panorama.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.700
But, you can also set the size of your image.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.360
In this example, they set the size to 600 by 300 pixels and

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.360
set the location to a latitude and longitude for the location of this image.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.630
In our example, we're not using latitude and longitude.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.580
We're just using street address and city.
