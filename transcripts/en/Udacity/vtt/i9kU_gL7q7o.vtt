00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.450
Zooming back in to what is going on within a given operating system, we already

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.310
know that the process address space for an application is an illusion in the

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.300
sense that the virtual memory space of this process is contiguous, but in terms

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.320
of physical memory, they are not contiguous.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.870
And the page table data structure that the

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.590
operating system maintains, on behalf of the processes.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.439
Is the one that supports this illusion so

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.800
far as this process is concerned. By mapping

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.430
the virtual page number of the process, using

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.440
the page table for this particular process into

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.880
the physical page number, where a particular virtual

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.530
page may be contained in physical memory. This

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.080
is a setting in a non-virtualized operating system.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.590
So the page table serves as the broker to convert a virtual page number to a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.420
physical page number. In a virtualized setting, we

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.239
have another level of indirection, that is this

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.710
physical page number of the operating system has

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.720
to be mapped to the machine memory or

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.960
the machine page numbers. We'll call the pages

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.280
in the machine memory, which is the real thing,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.770
as MPN, short for Machine Page Numbers. And

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.750
this goes from zero through some max, which

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.210
is the total memory capacity that you have

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.960
in your hardware. This data structure, the page table,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.670
is a traditional page table, that gives a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.370
mapping between virtual page number and the physical

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.900
page number. And this is a traditional page

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.810
table. The mapping between the physical page number and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.500
the machine page number, that is PPN to MPN mapping, is kept

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.295
in another page table, which is called shadow page table,

00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:58.054
S-PT. So now, in a virtualized setting, there's a two-step

00:01:58.054 --> 00:02:02.864
translation process to go from VPN to MPN. The

00:02:02.864 --> 00:02:08.050
page table maintained by the guest operating system is the one

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.920
that translates VPN to PPN and then there is this additional page table called a

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.580
shadow page table that converts the PPN

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.820
to MPN. That brings up an interesting question.
