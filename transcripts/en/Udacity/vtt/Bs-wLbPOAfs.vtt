00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.390
So now, I did the hard part for you. Now, it's time for you to tell me what

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.763
these values should be. That most likely contain the true population mean if all

00:00:10.763 --> 00:00:15.834
the people in our Klout population were to start using Bieber Tweeter. What

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:21.180
would be our interval estimate that most likely contains what this population

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.202
mean would be if everyone in our Klout population started using the Bieber

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:32.332
Tweeter? So, figure out what this is and this. And just a reminder, here are our

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:39.736
population parameters, the mean was 37.72 and the standard deviation was 16.04.

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:45.883
And then, for our sampling distribution, the mean was 37.72, like you learned in

00:00:45.883 --> 00:00:51.490
the last lesson, and the standard deviation is the standard error, which is

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.547
sigma divided by root n Which we found to be about 2.71
