00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this problem, we've been asked to build a simplified Sudoko checker.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In this version, we're given an n x n matrix. In this case n equals 3.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We're going to insure that every number appears once in every column, and once in every row.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In this example, the 1 appears once in this column, once in this column, once in this column,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
once in this row, once in this row, and once in this row.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We can repeat that check for every digit in the grid.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Here's our plan of action for solving this problem.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We're going to go through each digit, 1 through n.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In this case, 1 through 3.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We're going to start with 1, and we're going to go through each row and column at the same time,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
checking to see that that digit occurs once and only once in each row and column.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Here we see 1 appears once in the first row and the first column,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
so we increment our counts by 1.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Then we check the second entry in the row and the column and then the third entry.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
At the end of checking each entry in the row and the column

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
we check our count and make sure that it equals 1 for both.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If either one is not equal to 1, then this grid is not correct.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Otherwise, if we go through each digit and see

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that every digit appears once and only once in every row and column,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
then this grid satisfies our modified Sudoku property, and we return True.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's code this up.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Here's the finished code for this problem.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
First we extract the size of the grid by looking simply at the length of the list p.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Then we start with the first digit and go through each digit,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
checking each row and column at the same time.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
For each entry in the row and the column, we see if that entry equals our digit.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If it does, we increment our counts.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Otherwise, we just move onto the next entry.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Once we go through that row and the column, we ensure that

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
the row count and the column count both are exactly 1.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
If they aren't then we return False and stop,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
because the grid has already violated our Sudoku property.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Otherwise, we keep going to the next row and the column

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
until we've gone through each row and column for that digit.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
After we are done with that digit, we move onto the next digit.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We go through every digit, ensuring the Sudoku property for each digit.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We return True, because there was nothing wrong with the grid,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
so therefore it passes the test.
