00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.700
So thinking about the exercise for a second, what does adequacy mean?

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.689
Well, there's no abstract invariant.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.050
And that really means you don't have to worry about anything for

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.980
this particular property, for this exercise.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.310
Or you can think about the in,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.680
the abstract invariant as just being the Boolean, value, true.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.580
If we make this simplification then the above adequacy criterion looks

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.030
like the following.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.240
For every abstract state S, there's going to be a concrete state T.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.090
And in that state the concrete invariance hold and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.480
if we apply the retrieve function to that state we get back to S.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.070
What this means is that we have to check for each situation we can get into,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.590
with the abstract specification there corresponds a valid concrete one.
