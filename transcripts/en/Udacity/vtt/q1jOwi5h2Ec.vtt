00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.178
So when we complete the square we add enough 1 pieces in order to make a

00:00:03.178 --> 00:00:09.693
perfect square. So, we can think about rewriting our polynomial x squared plus

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:16.780
4x plus 4 as the quantity x plus 2 squared. We know that this trinomial can

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.810
really be represented by a perfect square, with side lengths x plus 2, and x

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.030
plus 2. We use our perfect square trinomial pattern to rewrite our trinomial as

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.115
a perfect square. So, what do you think each of these trinomials would be

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:33.766
written as a perfect square? Keep in mind when you enter your answer, you

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.480
want to have something in parenthesis squared.
