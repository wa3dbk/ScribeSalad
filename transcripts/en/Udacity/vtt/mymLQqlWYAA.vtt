It is true, that using effects with viewport, means that

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.970
your content, is almost always going to be scaled, and not

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.040
match the native resolution. And definitely, in some cases, users

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.280
are going to have to zoom, to be able to see

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.290
or read anything, particularly text. Since, everything, all scaled depending

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.140
on the size of the screen, fitting the current layout, precisely,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.800
into the users screen. Whether, it's a four inch phone

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.520
or a 12 inch tablet, but actually, your text in UI

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.090
will not change at all on the desktop. Because,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.220
currently, at least, none mobile browsers, don't respond to

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.330
the view port at all. In some cases of

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.060
course, it's the right thing to do, if you

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.810
just want to get the UI to fit on the

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.630
screen, to use, fix with view port, like in

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.460
my sync app, but of course those dials are

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.370
awfully small, which makes the UI very hard to use.
