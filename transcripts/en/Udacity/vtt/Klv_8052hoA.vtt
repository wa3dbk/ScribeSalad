Let's say we want to know how a song about the content are used to teach the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.556
content might impact engagement. We're going to set up for a hypothesis test,

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:13.196
which will compare our current population with what we predict will be our new

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:18.512
population after this treatment or intervention. Remember, in a hypothesis

00:00:18.512 --> 00:00:23.119
test, we have the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. And the null

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.831
is that there's no significant difference between the population after the

00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:32.920
intervention is given and the current population parameter. And the alternative

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.804
could be one of three things, that the current population is less than what it

00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:42.280
will be after the intervention, that it's greater, or that it's just different.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.383
In this example, what could the null hypothesis be? Check all that apply.
