00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's take a look at some value proposition examples.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.260
I've selected some to just give you an idea of how other startups

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.440
have approached articulating their value proposition.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.310
Here was a company that was actually trying to develop a bio-based replacement

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.239
for surfactants.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.730
They actually went out and understood the problem, came up with some solutions,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.840
and were trying to explain the pains and gains of their value proposition.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.730
Another example was a robotics agricultural weeding device.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.390
You notice here they're not talking about their device at all;

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.220
they're talking about the problem.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.010
Hand weeding of farm fields for organic crops is a nightmare.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.970
Another example: a company that was actually trying to figure out

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.680
a better way to do cancer tests.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.600
They actually tried to understand what the problem was.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.800
And the problem was that cancer cells get detached and are circulating in the bloodstream,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.160
and oncologists and pathologists are trying to figure out

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.250
whether their patients have circulating cancer tumor cells.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.100
And their features match the pain and the gain.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.240
The rest of the slides give you some examples of value propositions in medical devices,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.590
in dental care, etc.

00:01:14.590 --> 99:59:59.000
