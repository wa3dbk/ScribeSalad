The drinking bird is starting to look sort of vaguely like the real thing if you

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:08.592
squint a lot. Modifying this model a bit more, I made the legs white. When I do

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:13.328
this and run the program, this causes what is called Z-fighting as you can see

00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:17.565
here. What is happening is the two polygons, one from the foot and one from the

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:22.415
leg are overlapping attempting to occupy exactly the same location. At one

00:00:22.415 --> 00:00:26.309
pixel, one surface's Z depth will be infinitesimally closer than the other due

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:30.705
to precision limits. At the next pixel over the situation maybe reversed. While

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:34.524
this is fine mathematically, it can't happen in the real world and curling makes

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:38.155
for unconvincing images. Examine the problem yourself by running the program.

00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:42.116
Find the link in the additional materials. The question to you is, which of

00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:46.309
these solutions will fix the problem? Make each leg a bit thinner so it doesn't

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.858
overlap with the foot. Use a newer GPU with a higher-precision z-buffer. Switch

00:00:50.858 --> 00:00:54.774
to another rendering algorithm, such as ray tracing. Remove the bottom part of

00:00:54.774 --> 00:00:59.095
each leg so that no part of the leg and foot overlap. I should not that two of

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.593
these answers are correct.
