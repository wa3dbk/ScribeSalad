00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.860
The dimensions of our garden are 12 feet in length, and 6 feet in width. Nice

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.076
solving if you found these two answers. Now, we're just getting warmed up, so

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:14.523
if you didn't get it, that's okay. Let's see how we solve. First we replace

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:20.740
this variable l with the equivalent expression 18 minus w. That goes inside

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.432
parenthesis here. Next we multiply each term in the parenthesis by w. So, we'll

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:32.966
have 18w minus w squared. Again, we have a quadratic equation here, since we

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:37.747
have w squared. So we want to move all these terms to the left-hand side so our

00:00:37.747 --> 00:00:43.592
w squared will be positive. So we'll add w squared to both sides and we'll

00:00:43.592 --> 00:00:48.870
subtract 18w from both sides. This gives us w squared minus 18w plus 72 on the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.540
left. And zero on the right. Next, we want to factor this quadratic. So, we

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.234
find factors of one times 72, equals 72, that sum to negative 18. These two

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:08.796
factors are negative six and negative 12. We'll set each factor, equal to zero,

00:01:08.796 --> 00:01:14.511
so the width can equal six or the width can equal 12. We know the length should

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:19.280
be 12 feet and the width should be 6 feet, since the length is the longer side.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.060
You'll notice that it doesn't matter which value that we use for w. The final

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.799
result will be the same rectangular garden. It will be 12 feet by 6 feet. And

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.662
as always, we can quickly check to make sure these dimensions are correct. If

00:01:32.662 --> 00:01:37.078
we go all the way around our garden, we'll have the perimeter, which is 12 plus

00:01:37.078 --> 00:01:43.328
6 plus 12 plus 6, which equals 36 feet altogether. This checks, since this is

00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:47.967
what we expected the perimeter to be in our original problem. For the area, we

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:53.926
multiple 12 by 6 to get 72 feet squared. This also checks, which is great,

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:57.745
since 72 was the area of our garden originally.
