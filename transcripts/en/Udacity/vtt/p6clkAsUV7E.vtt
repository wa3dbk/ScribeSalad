00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.820
Eventually our ADD produces a result, and when that happens we will broadcast

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.970
it. The broadcast of the result happens exactly as before in Tomasulo algorithm,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.550
except that the tag we carry for the result is the ROB entry,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.480
not the reservation station number. Because we have already freed

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.705
the reservation station. So what we do is we now broadcast, the tag of

00:00:23.705 --> 00:00:29.590
ROB6 with a value, let's say, 15. Just like with Tomasulo's algorithm,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.540
this value, and the tag are now, given to the reservation stations.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.470
And they normally capture the result based on the tag, as before. This result is

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.990
now broadcast to the reservation stations. And they capture this result if,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.530
if they need it. And those that need the result of this instruction will capture

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.230
the value 15 just like, we did in Tomasulo's algorithm. So this has not changed.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.250
Without the ROB, we would now also capture this result in the register.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.440
And update the RAT to point to that register. With the ROB,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.498
we don't want to write to the register yet, so we write to the ROB instead.

00:01:12.498 --> 00:01:18.420
So these broadcast value now goes to the ROB, and we write 15 here and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.560
mark the instruction as done. Also. The result of the instruction,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.230
is not going to be in the registers. So, we do not update the RAT, to point to

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.300
the registers. In fact, the RAT is still pointing to the correct place.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.010
The result of the instruction is in the ROB now. So, we don't do this here.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.930
After broadcasting its result, the instruction would be completed,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.760
in Tomasulo's algorithm. With the ROB. We're still not done with it.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.490
Yes, we have computed the result and logged the computation as done, but

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.560
we have not deposited this result in the registers. For

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.550
that there is an additional step, called commit. To commit this instruction,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.190
we must first commit all of the previous instructions. So each cycle,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.940
we test whether the next instruction at the commit point is done. In which case,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.900
the commit point can move on and commit this instruction. So eventually,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.800
the commit point will reach here. And now, we will

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.190
test whether this instruction is done, find out that it's done, and commit it.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.450
The committing of the instruction, consists of actually taking this value, 15,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.500
and writing it to the register that the instruction is supposed to write to.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.350
In this case R1. So, 15 will be retained here. And also,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.370
we need to update the RAT, because it's pointing to the entry ROB6, that entry

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.380
will be freed after we commit this instruction. So instead of pointing to ROB6,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.610
now we can point to R1. So really, the updating of the RAT for

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.730
writing to the register, has moved from the broadcast time to the commit time,

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.530
because that's when we are actually updating the registers. And

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.830
after committing this instruction, the commit point will move, even further, so

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.500
that the next instruction to commit will be here, and that completes our

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.620
reorder buffer processor step by step, for one instruction. As you can see,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.390
many other things, are happening exactly the same as in Tomasulo's algorithm.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.460
Some of the things have changed, like point the RAT to the ROB entry instead of

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.560
the reservation station. Writing to the ROB, on broadcast instead of

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.720
the register file. And also we have added, a step here for committing.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.080
Also we can free the reservation station on dispatch, not on broadcast. And

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.860
finally, we need a new step for actually committing the instruction.
