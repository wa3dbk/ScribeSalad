00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Today, we're going to be talking about customer relationships.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In other words, how do you get, keep and grow customers.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So in the last lecture, you remember the business model canvas, all the 9 components of a startup.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We talked about value proposition, we talked about customer segments,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we talked about channels, but today we're going to focus on customer relationships.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Customer relationships really is about how do you get customers, how do you keep customers,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and how do you grow them.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Here are two get, keep and grow funnels, and the one thing to note is just the one on the top

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
represents a physical channel and the one on the bottom is web/mobile

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and the thing to just remember is at physical channel is we're going to see later of the details

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
inside of how you get or acquire customers are different

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
than how you would acquire customers in web/mobile.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Just know that the physical representation of the customer's life cycle--get, keep and grow,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
is kind of this double-barreled funnel and that's why we draw this way.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It just allows you to kind of understand how do customers get into our company,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
how do we get them, how do we keep them, and how do we grow them.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And so let's look at both of these get, keep and grow for

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
physical and web/mobile channels in a little more detail.
