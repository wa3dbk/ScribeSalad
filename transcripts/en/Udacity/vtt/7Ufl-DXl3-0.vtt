00:00:00.241 --> 00:00:02.415
So let's dive in.

00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:03.971
Here are our kittens again.

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:06.887
By the way, that's Lyes,
the boy kitten on the right.

00:00:06.887 --> 00:00:08.943
We don't have a name for the girl yet.

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:12.019
Anyway here's what a picture
element looks like.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.391
You'll notice that this picture
element contains two source elements.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:20.155
You might have seen those used for
video or audio elements.

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:22.200
Source elements do what you'd expect.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.667
They provide optional file sources.

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:27.408
If the browser can use
the first source it will.

00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:29.836
Otherwise, it keeps
looking down the list.

00:00:29.836 --> 00:00:34.029
The picture element is a great way
to provide alternative sources for

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.904
image files.

00:00:34.904 --> 00:00:39.352
So the browser can choose
depending on device capabilities.

00:00:39.352 --> 00:00:42.940
We've used the source element
here to specify webp for

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.691
for browsers that support
the webp with a JPEG fallback.

00:00:46.691 --> 00:00:50.667
This is a great way to make use of
the high performance webp format on

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:54.501
platforms that support it,
while providing an alternative for

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:55.996
platforms that don't.

00:00:55.996 --> 00:01:00.132
You can find out more about webp from
the article linked to below the video.

00:01:00.132 --> 00:01:02.381
By the way, that webp file is massive,

00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:05.733
looks like I should have saved
it with lossy compression.

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.581
Talking about fall backs again,

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:11.080
what about browsers that don't
support the picture element?

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.106
Well, that's easy.

00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:15.351
We just include a plain
old image element.

00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:17.952
In fact,
the image element is non optional,

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:21.659
because that's the element that
actually displays the image.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.264
The picture element scaffolding,
so to speak.

00:01:24.264 --> 00:01:27.501
Simply tells the image
what source to choose.

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:30.604
In fact,
we can rewrite the example like this.

00:01:30.604 --> 00:01:34.504
Because the browser defaults to
the image element if it can't use any of

00:01:34.504 --> 00:01:37.762
the sources, earlier on you
learned about art direction.

00:01:37.762 --> 00:01:42.470
One of the core problems you have
when serving images to a variety of

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.094
screen sizes and display sizes is
that although some images scale

00:01:47.094 --> 00:01:51.989
quite nicely from large to small,
other images don't work so well.

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:56.075
They may have too much detail to
work well on a small screen or

00:01:56.075 --> 00:02:00.350
be too wide to work on a view
port with a portrait orientation.
