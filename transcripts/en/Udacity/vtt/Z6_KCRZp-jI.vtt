00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.030
Let me start with a somewhat trivial
example just to contrast the notion of

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.660
fast memory obliviousness
to fast memory awareness.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.340
Consider the problem of
sequential reduction.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.570
Let's start by reviewing
the fast memory aware version.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.340
It scans the list in units of size L
to match the memory transfer size.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.760
Notice that l is an explicit variable or

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.910
parameter of the algorithm, but
at least the algorithm is I/O optimal.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.830
It performs just n/L transfers.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.730
By contrast, suppose that the hardware
in the operating system managed fast

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.980
memory for you.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.940
For instance, maybe you already know
about caches from the OMSCSHPCA course.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.940
If so, you could regard this hardware
managed fast memory as a cache.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.720
Or, maybe you know about
virtual memory and

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.260
translation look-aside buffers from
the OMSCS operating systems class.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.500
If so, you could imagine
the operating system and

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.960
the hardware acting in concert to move
pages of data from disk to main memory.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.150
They would swap pages out of main
memory, which would be the fast memory

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.090
in this case, back and forth to
disk whenever main memory is full.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.870
In either case, the purpose of
the automatic systems is to let you

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.800
write the conventional algorithm.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.430
It's a lot simpler, because fast
memory is automatically managed,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.560
the algorithm doesn't need to
move data around explicitly.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.810
The automatic system takes each read or
write,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.840
checks that the data is already in fast
memory, if so, it returns the value and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.380
otherwise it goes to slow memory
in order to retrieve the value.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.940
And if it retrieves the value,
of course,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.940
it'll do transfers in blocks of size L.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.390
Notice that the conventional algorithm
makes no references to z or L.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.110
Thus, we say that the algorithm
is oblivious to fast memory.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.620
So if we had a good model of how
automatic data movement works,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.430
we'll be able to analyze
conventional algorithms, and

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.680
say how many memory
transfers would they incur.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.100
Given such a model, we'll be able to
analyze conventional algorithms, and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.652
in this case show that the conventional
way to do a reduction also incurs just

00:01:54.652 --> 00:01:56.600
n/L transfers.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.490
This discussion points
out two questions,

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.645
which is what this lesson is all about.

00:02:00.645 --> 00:02:05.095
First, what should we assume about
how the automatic system behaves?

00:02:05.095 --> 00:02:08.455
Secondly, can we create
algorithms without z or

00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:13.115
L parameters that nevertheless match the
performance of algorithms that do use z

00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:14.605
and L parameters?

00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:17.865
That's what we mean by oblivious,
though, of course,

00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:19.905
we mean it in a positive sense.

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:22.000
One last note about terminology.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.340
We will by convention refer
to this fast memory as cache.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.370
It’s just a shortcut.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.205
Sometimes cache really means say,

00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:30.900
virtual memory backed main memory for
disk.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.320
It helps that it's a lot easier to say
cache oblivious than automatic fast

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.170
memory oblivious.
