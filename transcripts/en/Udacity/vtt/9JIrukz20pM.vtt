00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.360
Alright, so we've looked at
projected IR versus natural light.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.860
What are the advantages of this
projected light, or projected IR?

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.970
Well, yes it works in low light.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.730
You're not counting on
having external light.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.320
You're not counting on having texture
that you can deal with since I'm

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.070
projecting this texture, and its okay if
I've got repeated things because I'm,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.530
I'm it's not actually repeated
in a speckle pattern.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.680
Remember we had this problem
with picket fences in stereo?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.700
How all the pickets look alike, to know
which picket it is, is a challenge.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.460
Well, if you painted all the pickets
different colors or different speckles,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.240
that's not a problem, and
that's what the connect does.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.846
And in particular, you can tailor your
algorithms to the actual pattern that

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:41.799
you're producing and
engineer the thing to work really well.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.430
What are the advantages
of natural light?

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.200
Well it's natural light.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.090
So it works outdoors, it works
in sunlight, it works, you know,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.240
it just works whenever it's,
the lights are turned on.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.865
Doesn't work in the dark, that's okay,
neither do I, but the idea is that,

00:00:55.865 --> 00:00:58.075
you know,
you're just basically using the scene.

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:00.485
The other thing is that you don't have
to worry about the resolution of your

00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:03.515
projection, you've got the whatever
at your high-resolution sensors.

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:07.085
It's a lot easier to build
high-resolution sensors than

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:09.525
high-resolution projectors.

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:12.045
Both of them have some difficulties,
you know,

00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:16.460
they, they if you have very
shiny surfaces, all right, or

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.830
specular surfaces like a mirror, right,
so your projection is going to go.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.480
And, you know, clearly,
if I'm doing stereo and I'm a robot, and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.940
I'm looking at a mirror, I see the thing
that's up there and I think oh,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.050
I could just reach down here and get
that light that's on this, oh no, okay?

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.200
It actually, the,
it doesn't see the table.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.670
And my projector, well,
it projects down so

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.230
it'll also be thinking about
the ceiling, all right?

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.810
So, doesn't work in any of those cases.
