00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is Bob can compute this because Bob knows r. Bob selected r.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Bob has received these two and the value of k1 is equal to r

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
because that was the one that Bob sent back here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That means Bob can compute these

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
subtracting r from W1 prime will give Bob that correct value of wire.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Bob cannot compute W0 though

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because the value used for k0 is meaningless and unknown to Bob.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This provides the property that we were looking for that

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Bob can select one of the two values that are the wire labels Alice generated.

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Alice doesn't learn which one he selected and Bob doesn't learn anything about the other one.
