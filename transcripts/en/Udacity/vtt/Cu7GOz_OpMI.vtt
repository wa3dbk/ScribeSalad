00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.840
The answers are 8, 4 and 16. Nice work if you got those three correct. Now, we

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.765
haven't seen something like this third one before, so don't worry if they gave

00:00:08.765 --> 00:00:13.470
you trouble. For the first one, I'm going to have power divided by root. So, 64

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.340
to the 1 for my power, and I take a square root since the denominator is a 2.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.780
So here, I really have the square root of 64, which we know is 8. And if I

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.705
think about rewriting this, I can see all the intermediate steps we can take to

00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:31.982
get there. We rewrite 64 as 8 squared and now, since we have a square root in a

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:38.440
square, we can use power divided by root. We have 8 to the 2 divided by 2,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.216
which is really just 8 to the 1 or 8. Now, these steps here are not necessary

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:47.825
in order to get to our final answer. If we understand that the square of 64 is

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:52.436
8, that's great. I just want to reinforce that we can use our same ideal of

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:57.614
power divided by root to simplify. We use similar reasoning for the second

00:00:57.614 --> 00:01:01.965
problem. We know that we have power divided by root, so 64 to the 1 for our

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:07.524
power, and 3 for our root, a cube root. We know the cube root of 64 is 4, and

00:01:07.524 --> 00:01:13.518
we can rewrite 64 as 4 cubed and use power divided by root to simplify. Again,

00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:18.810
this part isn't necessary if we know the cube root of 64 is 4. This is one of

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.950
the ones on our list of perfect cubes. For this third one, we're going to have

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.540
the cube root of 64 squared. This is our power of 2, and this is our root of 3.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.420
We know the cube root of 64 is simply 4. So we're going to have 4 squared. This

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.605
gives us a final result of 16. Now, you might have done this problem

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:43.775
differently. You might of squared the 64 first. We could have also written our

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:48.630
power inside of the radical first, and then taken the cube root. If we square

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.118
64, we'll get 4,096. And it turns out that the cube root of 4,096 is still 16.

00:01:56.118 --> 00:02:00.908
So, in terms of doing a root first or an exponent first, it doesn't matter.

00:02:00.908 --> 00:02:04.684
Usually, it's easiest to take the root first since we can get a smaller number

00:02:04.684 --> 00:02:09.316
here, and then square it. This is much harder since I wouldn't really know the

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:15.573
cube root of 4,096 off the top of my head. And, in fact, I definitely don't.
