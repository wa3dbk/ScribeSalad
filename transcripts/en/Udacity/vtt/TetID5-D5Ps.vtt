00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.670
The fourth topic I'd like you to be aware of is the Abstraction Mechanisms which

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.750
you can bring to bear in solving problems. As I indicated at the start of

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.760
the course, the key element in success in doing design, is having experience in

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.000
solving similar problems. The way that the human mind stores this experience is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.670
in terms, of chunks or vocabulary, such as words like client server,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.560
or visitor pattern. This Vocabulary can be thought of at different levels. So

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.830
at one end are, programming idioms that is snippets of program text which,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.240
it's almost as if you've memorized in order to accomplish some specific task.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.180
Classes of course are an Abstraction Mechanism, and being aware of

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.350
whatever Classes are available to you in system libraries can ease your task of,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.230
of constructing the application. A little while later we're going to be talking

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.240
about design patterns and I mentioned one a second ago the visitor pattern.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.100
Being aware of those already existing solutions can help you avoid problems. And

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.349
we'll be talking in this course about aspects but aspect orientated programming

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.000
is a way of specifically dealing with cross cutting concerns.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.150
We'll also won't be talking much about object orientated frameworks. Well,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.580
they too are existing patterns of solutions which, if you are aware of them,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.090
can significantly increase your productivity. And, as we've

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.650
already talked about, architectural styles, [UNKNOWN] approaches to solutions at

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.360
the architectural level, are a powerful mechanism you want to be familiar with.
