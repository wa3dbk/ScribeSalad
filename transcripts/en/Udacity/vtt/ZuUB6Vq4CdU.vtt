00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.936
So if we repeatedly sounded the tone over and over and did not follow it with

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:09.042
meat powder, we would see the process of extinction. Eventually the dog would

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:13.348
start to salivate less, and then he would stop salivating all together. Here we

00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:18.404
could say the classically conditioned response has been extinguished. However,

00:00:18.404 --> 00:00:22.184
if we wait 2 weeks, and we come into the lab and we present the conditioned

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:28.650
stimulus, or we sound the tone, we see then the dog, in fact, will salivate.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.373
That salivation is termed spontaneous recovery. Spontaneous recovery happens

00:00:33.373 --> 00:00:37.468
when a previously conditioned response has been extinguished, and it occurs

00:00:37.468 --> 00:00:43.113
again when the conditioned stimulus is presented at a later time. So let's take

00:00:43.113 --> 00:00:47.343
a look at how these last 3 terms in classical conditioning. Aquisition,

00:00:47.343 --> 00:00:50.800
extinction, and spontaneous recovery occur.
