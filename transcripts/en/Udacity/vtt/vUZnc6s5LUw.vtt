00:00:00.108 --> 00:00:03.890
But now want to ask a different question which is, does this test reveal

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.760
the fault at line three? Clearly, here there is a possible problem, because

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.440
if we pass the right input, we can have a division by zero.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.760
Is that revealed if we run this test within the code? Yes or no?
