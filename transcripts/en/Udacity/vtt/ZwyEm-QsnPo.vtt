00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.110
Currently the monolith service
does not have any end points.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.860
One way to troubleshoot an issue
like this is to use a kubecti

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.170
get pods command with
a label [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.760
We can see we have a couple of pods
running with a monolith label.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.843
But what about app=monolith,
and secure=enabled.

00:00:19.843 --> 00:00:24.800
Notice that this label query
does not print any results.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.400
But what about our secure monolith pods?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.090
Let's see what labels they have.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.790
It seems like we need to add
the secure=enabled label to them.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.587
We can use the kubecti label
command to add the missing secure=

00:00:38.587 --> 00:00:41.496
enable label to secure monolith pod.

00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:44.793
Let's describe the secure-monolith
pod to see if it worked..

00:00:44.793 --> 00:00:47.136
And now that it's correctly labeled,

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:50.620
let's see the list of imports
on the monolith- service.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.842
And we have one,
let's hit one of the nodes again.

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:56.421
Bam!

00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:57.960
Houston we have contact.
