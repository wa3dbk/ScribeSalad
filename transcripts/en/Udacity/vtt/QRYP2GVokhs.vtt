00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.969
So, for all of this, basically what I am doing is I'm

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.570
collecting the value of the input using by using the .val method.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.380
And, I am collecting the h1, which is the h1 that we want to change.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.940
Then, all we have to do is set the text of h1 to the value

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.750
that we got right up here.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.580
Once we do that, we can scroll down and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.650
we can have some fun changing the title of the articles.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.310
That wasn't too hard.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.860
