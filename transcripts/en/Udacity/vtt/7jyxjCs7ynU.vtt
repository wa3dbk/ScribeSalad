00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.850
Let's summarize what we need to do.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.900
The AV audio recorder is going to call
out the record sounds view controller

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.530
once the recording is complete.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.170
And the file is saved right
to this function here.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.800
We need to den call the stop
recording segway and so

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.770
on along with it the path
to the recorded sound.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.160
If we had this line to the audio
recorder did finish recording function

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.410
that you see here.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.930
We can call the stop recording
segway and send it the URL for

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.240
the recording file is located.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.750
Notice something here, the audio
recorder did finish recording function,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.410
receives a flag, indicating if saving
the recording was successful or not.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.800
We should read that flag and

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.160
if saving the recording failed, we can
print out a message to the console.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.760
I'm going to switch out
the single call here.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.140
For an if statement.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.530
If the flag is true then I'm
going to perform the segue.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.990
And if it's false,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.910
I'm going to print out saving of
the recording failed out to the console.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.720
Now we just need a way to inform
the play sound's view controller

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.840
it just received the URL
of the recorded audio.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.600
Lucky for us,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.690
UI Kit makes that fairly simple as
I'll show you in the next step.
