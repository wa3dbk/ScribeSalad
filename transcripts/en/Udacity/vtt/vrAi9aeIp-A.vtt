00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So we're going to have another quiz about "while" loops.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This one's going to be a little trickier.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The same idea, your goal is to guess what this program will do

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and, like the last one, try to figure out the answer yourself

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
rather than by running the code.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We're going to assign 1 to the variable "i".

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We'll have a "while" loop where the test condition is: "i" is not equal to 10.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And, in the Block, we'll have a statement that says:

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
"i" is assigned the value of "i" plus 2--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so adding 2 to "i", then we'll print "i".

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So the choices are: produce an error,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
print out the numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
print out: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
print out: 3, 5, 7, and 9--or run forever.
