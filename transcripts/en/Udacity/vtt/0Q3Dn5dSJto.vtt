00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.576
Alright.

00:00:00.582 --> 00:00:05.025
I need to think about how many rounds of divisions I'll have. I know my cells

00:00:05.037 --> 00:00:09.245
are going to replicate over one day. One day is 24 hours. I know my cell divides

00:00:09.257 --> 00:00:13.775
every 2 hours, so I can take 24 hours and divide it by 2 hours, that'll give me

00:00:13.787 --> 00:00:18.490
12. This is the number of rounds of division I'll have. My cells are quadrupling

00:00:18.502 --> 00:00:23.110
each time after a round of division. I went from one cell to four cells. So

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:27.915
remember, this cell would split into four more cells. This one would, too. And

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:32.527
this one would, too. And so, would this last one. I went from 1, to 4, to 16.

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:37.248
I'm quadrupling the number of cells I have. So my base should be 4, and I have

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.865
12 rounds of division, 4 to the 12th. And I get an answer of 16,777,216. That's

00:00:42.877 --> 00:00:48.443
a ton of cells. We are going to figure out an easier way to write this number in

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:51.191
the next section. Great job for now if you got that right.
