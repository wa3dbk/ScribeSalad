00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.320
The answer is that both will be "Hello World", but they won't be upper case.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.780
Let's draw the diagram. Both variables, greeting and greeting2 point to the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.980
same string. But since to upper cause isn't a mutator, the string never

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.240
changes. Instead of changing the original string to upper case returns a new

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.630
string with upper case letters. I'm going to tell you a little bit of a secret.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.480
There's actually no method that can mutate a string. Some methods return a new

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.770
different string, but they never modify the original.
