00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.367
We can see from the general form for a complex number, a plus bi, that complex

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:10.637
numbers have both a real part, which comes from the number a, and imaginary

00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:15.847
part, which comes from this part bi. Remember a and a are just real numbers

00:00:15.847 --> 00:00:20.889
here, but this part bi is an imaginary part, because of the i. And we can talk

00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:24.854
about the size of a real number, by plotting it on a simple number line, because

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:28.639
there's just a linear progression of numbers, higher and lower than zero.

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:32.855
Because complex numbers have these two parts though, the real and the imaginary,

00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:36.822
we can't plot them in a one dimensional way. Instead, we need to plot them on a

00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:40.790
two dimensional axis, similar to the Cartesian Coordinate Plane we've been

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.257
working with. This fulfills a very different purpose though. We're not graphing

00:00:45.257 --> 00:00:49.417
equations on here, we're not relating variables x and y to one another, we're

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:53.831
just graphing numbers that are written in this form. What we do is we label this

00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:58.474
horizontal axis on our plane, the Real axis. And we say that the vertical axis,

00:00:58.474 --> 00:01:03.262
is the Imaginary axis. So for any complex number, written in the form a plus bi,

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:07.865
we can instead write it as the point, a comma b, on this coordinate plane. So

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:12.562
the horizontal coordinate, comes from the value of the real part, and the

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:18.005
vertical coordinate comes from the coefficient of the imaginary part. Let's look

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:22.637
at an example. So i plot the point, 4 comma 6, on our set of axis, this

00:01:22.637 --> 00:01:28.097
translates into the complex number 4 plus 6i, that's what's being depicted by

00:01:28.097 --> 00:01:33.581
this point on this plane. Let's say we want to express negative 7 plus 2i, we go

00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:38.881
to negative 7 horizontally, and then up 2. So on this plane, we can graph any

00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:40.915
number written in this form.
