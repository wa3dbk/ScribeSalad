00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.410
So when you do this you could then come up with a UML diagram that organizes

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.880
the important nouns related to the electronics into a, into a diagram.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.460
In this case there's main classes having to do with the coffee maker which

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.810
as you indicated, then has parts corresponding to the graphical user interface.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.090
That would be the buttons and the, the lights to the the part

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.770
having to do with the, the boiler which includes a sensor and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.580
a heater and the warming plate which also includes a sensor and

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.190
a heater. And then you might get excited by the fact you have two heaters and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.610
have an abstract class for heater and the same thing for

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.410
sensor and come up with a diagram that looks something like this.
