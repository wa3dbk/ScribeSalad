00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.532
So there's only two cases that can happen here, right? If inverse halt is run on inverse halt,

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:09.166
either this program will terminate, or it will go into an infinite loop.

00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:15.566
So what I would like you to think about now, what if inverse halt, when given inverse halt as an input,

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:22.566
actually stops? Does this mean that halt, when run on inverse halt as the program and inverse halt as the input,

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:31.032
returns yes? Or does this mean that halt, when run on inverse halt as a program and as an input, returns no?

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:35.932
Now, if you're thinking a bit ahead, you'll notice that there's a third answer here, but we'll discuss that in a minute.

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:43.967
For now, I just want you to tell me the direct implication of inverse halt halting when given inverse halt as an input.
