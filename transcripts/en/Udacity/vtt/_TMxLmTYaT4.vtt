00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.390
Now let's talk about measuring performance. We have seen

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.770
that we can express performance as 1 over execution time.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.022
But the execution time is on what workload? So if

00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:14.154
we want to measure performance on two machines and compare them,

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:16.126
the question is, what do we run on them to

00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:18.330
tell which on is faster than the other, and by

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.582
how much. The best assessment of how do they compare,

00:00:21.582 --> 00:00:25.400
is if we run actual workloads from a particular user.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.562
But, this requires us to run many different programs, what

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:31.290
we get is not representative of other users who might

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.638
be using this machine completely differently, and there is the

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:37.834
question of how do we get the workload data? Even if

00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:41.162
we found the user who's usage patterns are representative of

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:44.042
many others, how do we persuade that person to give us

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:46.794
exactly what they were doing with the machine over a

00:00:46.794 --> 00:00:51.120
course of, let's say, a day? So when we compare performance

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.970
of different machines, we usually don't do

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.810
this, instead, we use so-called benchmark workloads.
