00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.080
Let's consider a slight
generalization of a reduction

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.880
called a vector reduction.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.990
In it, we'll assume that every node
has not a single word of data, but

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.700
a vector of data.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.430
A vector reduction will be the
elementwise reduction of these vectors.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.000
So if we're doing a sum reduction,
then we'll take vectors, and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.490
we'll sum them elementwise.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.680
The result will be a single vector of
length n, whose elements are the sums

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.450
of the corresponding elements
from the other nodes.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.230
Now the corresponding algorithm
would change only very slightly.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.060
In our scalar pseudocode,
anywhere we sent a scalar,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.910
we could instead send the vector.
