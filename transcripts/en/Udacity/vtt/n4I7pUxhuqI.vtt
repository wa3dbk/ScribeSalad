00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.040
Now let me actually just recap for
a little bit.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.390
So this is basically the 2D image
transformations we are looking at.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.370
We have an object that
could be translated,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.070
this could be the image itself.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.440
We could scale it,
in this case I'm showing the scaling.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.210
We could rotate it, an affine warp, and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.420
a projective or
perspective warp would be this one.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.500
So basically let's
summarize all of them.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.540
I'm going to show this with
a simple kind of a table here and

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.700
of course we look at how we actually
want to do the transformation,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.470
what the three by three looks like, and
what kinds of things does it preserve.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.640
Of course, simple translation
two degrees of freedom, and

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.520
we know kind of how to
model this basically and

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.530
these are the two parameters we
would actually be kind of modeling.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.670
And of course in this case you only get
translation, orientation is preserved.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.240
Case if you clicked in where
there's a rigid transformation,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.330
three degrees of freedom,
the object is rotated.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.420
Here of course we would change if
there's translation involved in

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.540
these two values, but
also just the the cosine, theta, and

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.560
stuff like that would change
these four values here too.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.960
This would still remain
one as it is here.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.340
And, of course, zero, zero, zero, zero.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.170
I'm not implying that
this would be a zero,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.630
it just means that the cosines always
based on theta would be coming in.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.920
In this case,
the lens would be preserved.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.240
Third case similarity,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.340
where now we have scaled things
out four degrees of freedom.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.820
Basically what that means is now we
basically have the two parameters for

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.530
translation, assuming
there's translation going on.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.190
And scale parameters would be here and
the rest would be the same.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.960
For affine, we've looked at
this just in the quiz before.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.660
Everything that would preserve,
a parallelism would be preserved.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.360
Lines would be straight and
everything else.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.140
We also know that the six parameters
here would be the ones we would need to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.730
model and
that's the six degrees of freedom.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.670
Projective eight degrees of freedom,
all of these.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.180
This would be still one.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.620
Straight lines are preserved,
parallelism is not preserved.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.740
So if you notice as we down
this preserves orientation,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.280
because it's only translation.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.050
This doesn't preserve orientation, but

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.310
it preserves lens, but next time
all of the angles are preserved.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.320
Parallel lines and lines are preserved
and only straight lines are preserved.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.120
And if you notice this is
how we can go through and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.620
look at different types of images from
starting here looking at translation,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.010
rotation, scale, affine,
and perspec, projective.
