00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, all of this is fine and works well.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There's no bug in here, but there's nothing in there which prevents misuse of my class.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For instance, nothing prevents me from entering numbers in here which make no sense at all.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
For instance, I could enter -1 as the hour or -2 as the minutes or -3 as the seconds.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is not a valid time or we would have to come up with

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
entirely new definition of what the valid time is.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
However, we can still instantiate such an object and even printed out comes as -1, -2, -3.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So here we're still talking three numbers, but since Python does not provide static checking of types,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that is checking of types when the program is being compiled or rather executed,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
there's noting that prevents me from passing objects which have a completely different type.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So I could pass a string in here for instance and then hours would be initialized with the string--

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
this means that I would get a time object in here, which is entirely invalid.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So my situation is--I'm passing some string here in the hours attribute.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And now for a quiz, so if I do this, do I get an error when initializing the time object

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
or when printing the time object or never.
