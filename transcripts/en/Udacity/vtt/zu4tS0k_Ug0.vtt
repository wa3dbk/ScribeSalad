We've worked with frosted cake, but sometimes it might be better to know how

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.292
much cake was not frosted. Let's look at a simple case of this. If 2 3rds of a

00:00:08.304 --> 00:00:12.657
cake is frosted with vanilla icing, what fraction is not frosted? Well, let's

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.864
start off by looking at a cake. Here is a whole chocolate cake and I'm going to

00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:21.781
ice 2 3rds of it. So I've split my cake up into 3rds and I iced two of those

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:26.538
3rds. Here is 1 3rds and 2 3rds. One way to think about this is that the parts

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.168
must add up to the whole. I know that I have 2 3rds of the cake frosted in

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.196
vanilla icing and I have to add some amount to get a whole cake. So I know 2

00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:41.149
3rds plus some amount has to equal one. Well, this last piece is just 1 3rd, so

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:46.198
I can just put 1 3rd here. This is the amount that's not frosted. And remember

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.272
back from adding fractions, we know we just need to count up the 3rds. I have 1

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:56.371
3rd, 2 3rds, and 3 3rds altogether. So, this piece that's not frosted is 1 3rd.

00:00:56.672 --> 00:01:00.904
There's actually another way that we can think about this. Let's instead start

00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:05.046
with a whole cake and subtract off the parts that we don't want. We don't want

00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:09.197
the vanilla icing. So let's subtract the pieces we don't want from the entire

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:13.668
whole cake. I started with one whole cake and I'm subtracting off 2 3rds. Well,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.130
I know one whole cake is the same thing as 3 3rds. Remember, I can write one as

00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:22.577
1 divided by 1, beecause that's still one., and then I can multiply this

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:26.996
fraction by 3 over 3. I'm just going to turn one into 3rds or 3 3rds, so I have

00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.974
3 3rds minus 2 3rds which is 1 3rd. 1 3rd of my cake is not frosted. And what's

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:35.180
interesting about fractions is that it doesn't matter how much cake we're

00:01:35.192 --> 00:01:39.587
talking about. We could have started with a different cake, maybe we started

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.926
with a rectangular cake. Here is a rectangular cake and I'm going to ice 2 3rds

00:01:44.143 --> 00:01:48.385
of it. Doing the same problem with the rectangular cake doesn't change my

00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:52.650
answer. I still have 2 3rds of it frosted in vanilla icing and 1 3rd that's left

00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:57.160
unfrosted. The amount of cake that's frosted or unfrosted depends on the size

00:01:57.172 --> 00:02:01.234
and shape of the original cake. The neat thing about fractions is that 2 3rds

00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:05.951
could describe this part of a round cake or this part of a rectangular cake.

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:08.655
Fractions describe a part of a whole object.
