00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.840
The second line here specifies what type of data our x-axis represents.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.010
Which in this case,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.592
is a continuous time value as indicated by the Time Axis function.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.260
Notice that we call this function on the chart object return by

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.860
the dimple constructor function.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.080
We could potentially have multiple charts on a single page and this allows us

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.400
to specify which chart we would actually like to manipulate and add an axis to.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.500
The first argument is the axis which we would like to add, in this case, x.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.210
In the second argument, the string representing the column name of

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.940
what we would like to plot on that axis in this case, the year.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.480
So this line of code says, add to my chart a time axis which will be represented

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.110
by the x-axis on our chart and correspond to the year column of our data.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.200
The third line here specifies what type of data our y-axis should represent,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.830
and has an identical interface to the add time axis function.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.290
In this case, we have a continuous value we

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.280
would like to plot on our y-axis specified by add measure axis.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.860
The third line says add to my chart a continuous value

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.890
on the y-axis which corresponds to the attendance column of my data.
