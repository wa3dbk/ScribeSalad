00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.103
So let's think about how chaining would behave in a parallel setting.

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:07.811
For construction, that means we have many items to put into the hash table, 1 per thread.

00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:12.650
Per look up, that means we have many keys to look up in the hash table; again, 1 per thread.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.792
And chaining has 2 main disadvantages.

00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:18.320
Number 1, let's say we're looking up many items, 1 per thread,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.388
and we know to look up 1 item,

00:00:20.388 --> 00:00:22.461
we calculate the hash function for that item.

00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:25.176
That paralyzes nicely. It's just a map operation.

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:28.924
More problematic, however, is searching the link list in the bucket.

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:31.201
So we have a number of threads here.

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:33.926
Each thread ends up looking in a different bucket.

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:36.310
This particular bucket has 3 items.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.280
The bucket for thread 2 has 2 items,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.380
but the bucket for thread 1 has many, many, many items.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.254
Some threads, like thread 2, might find their item right away.

00:00:44.254 --> 00:00:47.093
Some threads, like thread 1, for instance,

00:00:47.093 --> 00:00:51.859
might have to visit many or even all the items in a lengthy link list before finding its item.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.623
Because threads within a warp run in lock step,

00:00:54.623 --> 00:00:59.568
the run time of a warp is completely dependent on the slowest lookup within the warp.

00:00:59.568 --> 00:01:03.393
The other threads in the warp have to wait until the slowest item is found,

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:06.633
and this behavior, as you might imagine, is bad.
