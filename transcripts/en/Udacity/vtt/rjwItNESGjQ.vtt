00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.710
Hello and welcome back. As you've seen

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.800
previously, an operating system has to protect the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.300
integrity of the hardware resources it manages while

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.736
providing the services to the applications. Thus it

00:00:13.736 --> 00:00:16.840
has many responsibilities and a variety of functional

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.240
components that provide these services. But how should

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.150
all these pieces fit together? At least some

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.530
of the components of the operating system will

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.630
have to run in a privileged mode

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.640
of the processor architecture that allows them access

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.470
to hardware. But must the whole operating

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.550
system have this privilege? Also, if an application

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.780
would benefit from having certain services, for

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.630
example, memory management handled in a particular way.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.750
Can we personalize the services to suit

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.910
the needs of the application? In other words,

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.810
can we make the operating system flexible in

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.340
terms of the policies it implements for the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.300
services offered by it? Does this flexibility have

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.380
to come at the price of performance and or

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.890
safety of the operating system? These are some

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.210
of the questions we will try to answer in

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.600
this course module. In this course module, we

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.620
will learn the basics of operating system structuring issues.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.700
We will use SPIN and Exokernel as case

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.660
studies of two closely-related approaches to providing extensibility

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.730
of operating system services. We will then study

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.680
a microkernel-based approach as well, using L3 microkernel.
