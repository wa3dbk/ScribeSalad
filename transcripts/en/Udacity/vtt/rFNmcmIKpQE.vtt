00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.370
Now let us look at
set-associative caches.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.770
We say that a cache is
N-way set-associative when

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.478
a particular block can be in one of
N possible lines where it can go.

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:17.810
So the overall cache now is
divided into regions called sets.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.730
In this case we have four sets.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.220
A given block can go to one of its sets.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.450
So pretty much we use some bits of
the block's address to tell us which set

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.960
does it need to go in.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.190
Within a set there could be a number
of lines that can contain a block.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.850
In this case we have a 2-way
set-associative cache because there

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.270
are two lines in a set, so a given block
could be in either of the two lines.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.120
Note that different blocks might go to
different sets, but a particular block

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.310
will map to one set and then it has
a choice between the two lines there.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.300
In this particular cache, we have
eight lines, four sets, and two ways.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.700
Note that N is 2 here.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.360
So we say that the cache
is 2-way set-associative,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.040
not when it has two sets, but
when there is two blocks in each set.
