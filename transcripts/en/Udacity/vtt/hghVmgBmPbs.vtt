00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.150
In this lesson, we will first
introduce the birthday paradox and

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.680
apply it to decide the length of hash,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.770
in order to make hash functions
resistant to collision attacks.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.800
We will then cover the secure
hash function and H max scheme.
