00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.770
Now we're going to explore these
ideas in a thought experiment

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.700
called the coin flipping casino.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.270
So, instead of buying and selling
stocks, we're going to flip coins and

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.330
we're going to be on the outcome of
whether those coins come up heads or

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.610
tails.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.990
So that's analogous to a single
investment in a stock, or

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.740
a single trade in a stock,
where you buy it and hold it and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.740
either you make money or you lose money.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.790
Well, we're going to flip a coin and
either make money or lose money.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.750
Now the coin is biased.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.800
In other words,
we have information about this coin, and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.180
we know that it's more likely
to come up heads than tails.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.575
In fact, that probability is about
0.51 that it will come up heads.

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:52.710
So that's our edge, that's like our
alpha when investing in stocks.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.480
And the uncertainty of the outcome
is like beta in stock investing.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.210
Here's how betting works.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.330
So you can bet on any particular
coin flip, you can bet n coins.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.930
If you win,
in other words it comes up heads.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.590
You now have 2 n coins.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.500
If you lose they take your money.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.530
So this is called an even money bet.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.380
So on each outcome you either
make n coins or you lose n coins.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.848
Here's how the casino works.

00:01:23.848 --> 00:01:29.716
There are 1,000 betting tables
each with their own biased coin,

00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:32.840
and you have 1,000 tokens.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.540
So you can chose to
bet however you like.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.200
In other words, you can put ten tokens
on each of a hundred tables, you could

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.910
put a thousand tokens on one table, you
could put one token on all the tables.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.620
Once you've distributed all your tokens,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.540
which represent your bets,
the coins are all flipped at once.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.770
In other words the game runs in
parallel, and for each bet that

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.070
you made you either Get your winnings or
they take the chips that you bet.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.840
So now that we've set up this
environment for us to experiment with,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.940
I want you to think
a little bit about it and

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.360
think about how would you
allocate these tokens?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.640
Is it better to bet all your
tokens on just one coin flip, or

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.850
is it better to bet on
multiple coin flips at once?
