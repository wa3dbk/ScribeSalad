00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.510
Now, let me show you a simple feature,
matching demo,

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.410
to kind of demonstrate how we can
do this kind of feature detection.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.960
To show you this demo,
let's go to the Sandbox.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.560
Again, remember,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.040
it's always going to have the last code
that you had played around with, and

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.390
here, I'm basically putting in the code
to help us do feature detection.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.040
Again, setting up numpy and cv2, and all
of that stuff, some code to draw things.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.930
Look for things in there and
read an image.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.360
Now, one thing I want to point out,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.370
we're using a special
variant on SIFT called orb.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.290
That's what we're going to be using.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.000
You should be able to, in your own
setup space, if you have all configured

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.140
correctly with open CVN python,
be able to actually use a Sift, also.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.780
I encourage you to look at documentation
of Sift on open CV to try that.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.470
So basically again, in this process,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.380
we come up with the whole
process to find the key points.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.450
We draw them, which is shown here,
and then we actually run a matching

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.760
algorithm to be able to
match these types of things.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.300
And once these matches are appearing,
we will print them out, and

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.030
then of course, show the matches.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.410
So let’s run.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.790
Okay, it’s pointing out the image sizes.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.170
It found 500 key points in the two
images, and found 257 matches.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.108
These are the two images.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:19.240
This one and this one.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.805
This is the box cover itself directly,
and this box,

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:28.280
again here, with conclusions and
all shown there.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.530
Of course, now, if you notice that I
actually did a lot of computation to

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.010
find all of those features
on both of these images,

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.980
lots of colors here, and once it found
those features, it matched them.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.360
So now,
I was starting to put this here, and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.040
if you notice, all of the visible
parts that were there, here,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.640
were matched between the image here and
this one image here.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.035
So this showcases how
this could be done, and

00:01:53.035 --> 00:01:55.470
this showcased the whole
code is right above here.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.080
I will even share with you this code so

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.750
you can actually play
around with it yourself.
