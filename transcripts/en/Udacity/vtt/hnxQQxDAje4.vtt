I know the slope is negative two, so this is my m. This point is actually the y

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:09.926
intercept. The x coordinate is zero, and then we move down four units on the

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:14.690
y-axis, so the b is negative four. So I make the subsitution for m and b, y

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.673
equals negative 2x plus negative 4. When I simplify this, I can just write y

00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:23.614
equals negative 2x minus 4. This is the equation of my line.
