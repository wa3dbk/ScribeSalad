Hi, and welcome to CS215 Social Network Analysis.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
My goal in this class is to give you an introduction

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to the analysis and design of efficient algorithms.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're going to focus on algorithms that will be useful to you

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
if you're trying to analyze large social networks.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm going to assume for this class that you have a familiarity with programming in Python

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and that you're comfortable with mathematical notation

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
about at the level of high school Algebra 2.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Unit 1 is going to be a bit of a warmup.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I want you to think about how you design computer programs to solve particular problems.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What we're going to focus on is how we can take advantage of mathematical properties

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of the problem that we're solving to speed things up.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm also going to introduce some social network terminology,

00:00:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
so that we'll be ready to dive into this topic a little bit more deeply in the later units.
