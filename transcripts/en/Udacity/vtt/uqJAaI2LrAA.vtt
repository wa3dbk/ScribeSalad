Congratulations, you've made it to the end of this unit. And what we've been

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.178
doing, is what's called object oriented design. And, I've avoided using that

00:00:07.178 --> 00:00:10.370
term so far both because I think it's hard to say, and it's not the most

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.195
pleasant of terms. The important point is that, we've been developing techniques

00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:17.992
to manage complexity by dividing complex problems into objects. And the objects

00:00:17.992 --> 00:00:21.649
can be combined to solve the problem that we care about. This is different from

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:25.676
procedural programming. That we focused on for the first seven units of the

00:00:25.676 --> 00:00:29.812
class. Where we're solving a complex problem by dividing it into procedures that

00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:33.374
can be combine to solve the problem. The difference is objects providing

00:00:33.374 --> 00:00:38.048
encapsulation. We can combine procedures and data, and complex data all into one

00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:42.330
object and us that object as one thing. The way we do this in Python is use

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.810
class to make new types and inheritance to reuse classes to create lots of new

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.676
classes. So thanks for sticking through the end of the unit. And at this point

00:00:49.676 --> 00:00:52.784
you really are a powerful programmer. You've got the tools to manage complex

00:00:52.784 --> 00:00:55.590
programs. And you should be able to start really creating interesting programs

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.602
on your own. One thing we haven't talked about yet, is how to deal with the rest

00:00:58.602 --> 00:01:01.834
of the world in your programs. That's what we'll get to in the next unit. Hope

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:02.409
to see you there.
