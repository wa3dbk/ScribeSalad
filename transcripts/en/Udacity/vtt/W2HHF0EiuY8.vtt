00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.620
Here is a visualization of the RGB color space. The axis to the left shows the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.738
red channel increasing. The vertical axis is green. And the channel to the right

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:13.437
is blue. We can't see the interior of the cube showing intermediate values. All

00:00:13.437 --> 00:00:16.918
the values we can see in this particular have one or more channels at the

00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:20.717
maximum. Here's a view inside the cube with the red and blue axes swapped. Next,

00:00:20.717 --> 00:00:25.694
this direction doesn't really matter. The point inside the cube shows how sky

00:00:25.694 --> 00:00:31.675
blue is formed by the RGB values of 1 5th red, 3 5th green, and 4 5th blue.

00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:35.397
Another way to visualize the RGB color space, is to take a slice of the cube at

00:00:35.397 --> 00:00:38.996
these three corners. Each corner represents a single color channel at full

00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:43.135
intensity, with the other two channels off. For example this vertex is where

00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:47.170
green is set to one and red and blue are 0. By slicing a plane through these

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.808
three corners, we'll be able to see where red plus green plus blue equal 1. This

00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:55.978
slice gives another view of how these colors blend. This is what the next

00:00:55.978 --> 00:00:57.163
exercise is about.
