00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.254
Okay? So if we know that 98% of sample means will lie between negative 2.33

00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:13.760
standard deviations away. And positive 2.33 standard deviations from the mean.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.496
Then what's going to be our interval estimate, or our confidence interval, for

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:23.872
the population mean with the treatment? In this case again the Beiber Tweeter

00:00:23.872 --> 00:00:28.793
app. So this is going to be from what value to what value?
