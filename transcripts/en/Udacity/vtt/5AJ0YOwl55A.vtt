00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.040
Let's study some of the basic premises of how an image is

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.170
formed from a 3D scene.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.390
We start off with just a simple representation of a 3D scene,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.390
we have a lens, and of course, because of this lens, now we know that we

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.530
can actually create an image of this 3D scene on the other side of the lens.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.620
Here, I'm basically just now showing you a simple paradigm where, again,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.100
a lens, all the light goes through, the lens here generates a 3D scene.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.800
And this is basically all the light from this thing is

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.780
now going through this lens and captured here.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.930
Most of the time we will actually be putting a sensor,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.920
where we want to capture the image, at the focal plane of a lens.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.510
So at f, distance away from the lens, we want to be able to capture the image.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.490
And this is where actually we want to be able to put our sensor.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.305
And that, you will see various examples why that's important.

00:00:53.305 --> 00:00:58.280
Let's look at a few examples of what happens if certain things change in this

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.950
image formation pipeline.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.460
Again we have a 3D object, lens, and

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.120
at the image being formed at the focal point of this lens.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.590
So as I said, now I'm going to push the sensor or film or

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.120
any form of a screen here that's going to be where we want to capture images.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.740
You may remember this was the concept that was there in the pinhole camera in

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.170
the previous lecture, too.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.276
We always wanted to create an image at the focal plane away from the lens.

00:01:24.276 --> 00:01:31.430
So what happens if I was to now move this tree further away from the lens?

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.860
So everything else is the same, I've just moved the tree here.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.440
By doing simple geometry on this one you will notice that when you take and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.500
trace the rays of light through the lens, a tree is formed on the image sensor.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.990
Except that now, of course, it's much smaller.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.080
This is the image size here.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.780
Of course it's much smaller on this side here.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.220
And that's valuable because in essence as I move the tree farther away,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.350
of course it should look more distant.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.300
So this is exactly doing what we expect it to do.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.580
And if I had let's say two trees, one in front and

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.268
one in back, the further one should be looking smaller.

00:02:08.268 --> 00:02:13.500
So this is kind of giving me a sense of depth of perspective,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.740
which basically says things farther away would be smaller.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.070
Now let's look at what happens if I move the tree inwards.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.610
Same lens, same situation, same location of the sensor and, of course,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.430
if you just draw the rays of light and do the projection again,

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.750
you will notice that this time, the tree is bigger.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.310
So this tree is smaller and of course this tree is much bigger.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.510
And again, same example applies, it's closer to a sensor,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.390
therefore it appears to have more, size and it appears to be larger.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.820
So this just demonstrates that by changing distances of the object to

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.200
the lensing system, the camera here, we can now actually see closer or

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.250
farther off objects.
