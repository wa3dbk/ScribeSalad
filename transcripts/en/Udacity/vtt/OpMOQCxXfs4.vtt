00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.867
Okay, and that's Stratton's Taxonomy.

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:06.488
Data layout transformation, transforming scatter patterns to gather patterns.

00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:10.433
Tiling, so that we can share input upon multiple threads.

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:14.384
Privatization, so that we can avoid sharing output, as long as possible.

00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:19.001
Binning and spatial data structures, so that we can reduce the amount of input

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.938
that's necessary to look at for given output.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:25.770
Compaction, so that we can avoid processing inactive

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.709
inputs and process more efficiently on a sparse set of inputs.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:37.340
And regularization, where we can extract regular parallelism from irregular parallelism,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.424
often in the face of strategies like binning and spatial data structures or the scatter to gather transformation.

00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:45.922
Now you've encountered most of these ideas already in the class.

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:48.602
But I do hope this overview helps you think consciously

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:51.768
about the strategies you can employ to optimize parallel programs.

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:55.392
I definitely recommend that you read the original papers if you're interested in learning more.

00:00:55.392 --> 00:00:57.934
They give examples from much different bench marks

00:00:57.934 --> 00:01:00.161
and describe case studies for some of these techniques.

00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:06.422
I find them useful to help me be principled in my thinking about Parallel Optimization.

00:01:06.422 --> 00:01:10.712
I'll include, again, links to those papers in the instructor's notes and on the wiki and so forth.
