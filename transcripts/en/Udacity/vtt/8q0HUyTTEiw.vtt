00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.340
This point you're probably
sick of matrix multiply, but

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.880
I can't say enough what an important
computational primitive it is to study.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.080
Now I say that, not only because I
think it has important applications,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.219
it's also because you can use it to see
a lot of different analysis techniques.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.600
For instance, in this lesson you saw
different algorithmic approaches

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.570
like 1-D versus 2-D
versus 3-D distributions.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.540
As well as a way to argue about
communication lower bounds.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.210
It won't always be easy to do those
sorts of analyses on other algorithms,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.409
but I hope you'll try.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.700
Another reason to think about matrix
multiply is that for better or for

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.510
worse, the machines we build today,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.310
if you're a wee bit cynical like me,
are tuned for it.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.610
For instance,
you should have noticed something.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.430
When the problem is big enough, there's
a lot more work than communication.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.790
That means matrix multiply ought
to scale well as systems and

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.580
problems get bigger.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.300
It's in that sense that things like
the top 500 list, which measure peak

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.319
capability, might not translate to more
communication-intensive applications.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.380
Now speaking of big, and I admit this
fact as a bit of a non sequitur.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.460
Did you know that a Rubix cube has
43 quintillion 252 quadrillion 3

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.390
trillion 274 billion 489 million 856
thousand possible configurations?

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.130
Try telling people that fact at
your next cocktail party, and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.240
I'm sure you'll be a really big hit.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.634
Just like me, because I'm a huge hit
at cocktail parties with my numbers and

00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:37.100
my constants out to ten digits and
stuff.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.640
Very cool.
