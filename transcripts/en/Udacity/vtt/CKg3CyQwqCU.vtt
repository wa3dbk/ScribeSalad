00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.890
Alright, this is one of the things I've
been wanting to teach you ever since we

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.150
started learning about design, and
this is about animating transitions.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.970
It's easy to throw in
some Android L activity

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.506
transition animations to
spice up our application.

00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:19.690
In Android 4.4, we added our transitions
framework but in Android L, we made it

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.810
easy to apply these transitions
when moving between activities.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.610
As you can see clicking on
an item in our forecast list

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.600
causes custom animations to occur as
we transition into the next activity.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.350
The toolbar at the top and
the bottom details move into place and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.815
everything else fades.

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:40.015
Hitting the back key causes
a slightly different animation.

00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:43.535
Just the bottom moves out,
and everything else fades.

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:47.445
This was done by first creating
a transition resource.

00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:51.940
In this case, our transition resource
contains a transition set for

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.170
how we want our views to move.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.020
We want all these animations
to play together for

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.950
a duration of a half a second.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.110
We want everything to fade between
the views, except for the status bar and

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.480
the navigation bar.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.230
If we don't specify a target in a
transition, it will apply to all views.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.820
Exclude ID tells our fade
to apply to all views that

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.800
aren't in another transition.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.770
Pretty handy.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.840
We're going to have our
toolbars slide in from the top.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.910
And the detail pane slides in
from the bottom and that's it.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.510
We could do a lot more, but
too much animation can be distracting.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.960
Now we still have to tell
Android how to apply the theme.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.990
I'm going to add it to our custom theme.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.260
We could specify it in code, but
I recommend doing it this way.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.640
It's nice to be able to change
all of this from resources.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.530
Note that we are both
applying themes here, and

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.670
setting a window flag to
enable content transitions.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.460
Content transition must be enabled in
both the starting and ending activity.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.330
And then we still have to write
a tiny amount of code to enable

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.950
a scene transition.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.210
When we call start activity, we need
to give the system a special bundle.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.780
Fortunately, ActivityCompat
will do the right thing for us.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.290
And that's it.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.500
See the instructor notes for
links to learn more about animations and

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.520
the transition framework.
