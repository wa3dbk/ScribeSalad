00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.000
aria-live allows developers to
mock a part of the page as live,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.750
in the sense that updates should be
communicated to users in a timely manner

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.260
rather than if and when they happen
to explore that part of the page.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.590
One example might be a status
message which appears as a result

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.950
of either a user action or
an external event.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.830
If this message is important enough
to grab aside a user's attention,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.700
we can direct and assist
a technology user's attention to it

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.460
by setting an aria-live attribute on it.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.120
When an element has
an aria-live attribute we refer

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.425
to the part of the page containing it
and its descendants, as a live region.

00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:40.690
aria-alive has three allowable values,
off, polite, and assertive.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.400
Off is the default value.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.010
It can be specified
explicitly if need be, but

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.694
not setting it aria-live attribute
at all will have the same effect.

00:00:49.694 --> 00:00:53.720
aria-live = "polite" tells
us assistive technology,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.200
alert the user to this change when
you finished whatever you were doing.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.980
It's great to use if something
is important but not urgent and

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.109
accounts for
the majority of aria-live use.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.180
In this example we have a chat
widget which uses aria-live

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.650
to reflect the most
recent chat activity.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.250
When a new check message appears it'll
be announced to a screen reader user

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.793
once any in progress
utterance has finished.

00:01:15.793 --> 00:01:19.990
aria-live = "assertive" tells
assistive technology to interrupt what

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.810
ever it's doing and alert the use
to this change immediately.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.200
This is only for important and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.260
urgent updates, such as a status message
like, there has been a server error and

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.570
your changes are not being saved,
please refresh the page.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.490
Or update to an input field as
a direct result of a user action,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.030
such as buttons on a step or widget.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.020
In this case, once this alert bar has
some content, it'll interrupt whatever

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.650
the user was doing with
an announcement of its content.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.070
To demonstrate this in practice,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.610
here's a demo of aria-live use
in the custom number input.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.830
You can see the dom for
the custom number input on the right.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.540
We have a container element
with a roll of spin button.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.978
Then a span containing the numerical
value and an Add and Subtract button.

00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:06.819
The span within the numeric value has
an aria-live value of assertive, meaning

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.560
whenever it changes, whatever speech
is in progress should be interrupted.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.110
One of the thing to notice is
I've used aria described by,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.760
to associate the element with
this bit of help text underneath.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.990
So I'll probably hear that once
I set focus on the element.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.500
I'm going to turn on Chromebooks light,
tap to the element, and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.950
then I should hear the label and it's
going to start reading the description.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.191
Then I'm going to use the up
arrow to add ten to the value.

00:02:32.191 --> 00:02:33.330
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.660
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Number input demo.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.880
Current value.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.760
Spin button.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.290
Use add and subtract buttons or
up and down arrows.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.329
10.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.552
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:02:44.552 --> 00:02:47.670
So it immediately told me the new value,
and interrupted what it was saying.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.245
I can do that again.

00:02:50.245 --> 00:02:53.440
&gt;&gt; 20.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.260
&gt;&gt; Or use the mouse.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.177
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] 30.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.678
[SOUND] 20.

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:02.720
&gt;&gt; Or use the screen reader.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.687
&gt;&gt; Add button.

00:03:03.687 --> 00:03:06.369
[SOUND] 30.

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:07.796
&gt;&gt; And the same thing happens.

00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:11.525
So those are the basics of aria-live.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.075
We have just a couple of tips for

00:03:13.075 --> 00:03:15.133
working with aria-live
regions in practice.

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:20.615
Firstly, your aria-live region should
probably be in the initial page load.

00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:24.215
This is not a hard and fast rule,
but if you're having difficulty with

00:03:24.215 --> 00:03:27.290
an aria-live region,
this could be one of the issues.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.100
Secondly, different screen readers and

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.100
assistive technologies react differently
to different types of changes.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.460
For example, it's possible to trigger an
alert on some screen readers by toggling

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.010
a descendant element's hidden
style from true to false.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.570
But this technique does
not work on others.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.370
So if you're having issues with
getting an aria-live region to speak,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.980
experiment with some different
types of content changes

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.320
to see what works on
the platforms you're targeting.
