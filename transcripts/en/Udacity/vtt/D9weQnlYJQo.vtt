00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.158
This means that this is graphing an even function. Let's think about y. If we

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:07.938
pick a y coordinate on any one of these graphs, let's say 10, [inaudible]

00:00:07.938 --> 00:00:11.907
distance we need to move to the right, in order to hit our curve, is the same as

00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:15.750
the distance we would need to move, to the left to hit the curve, just in the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.228
opposite direction of course. So that means the x coordinate, of the point whose

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:24.648
y coordinate is 10, on the right side, is just the opposite of the x coordinate,

00:00:24.648 --> 00:00:28.884
of the point whose y coordinate is 10 to the left side of the y axis. This makes

00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:32.278
sense mathematically as well. Let's take a look at y equals x squared to see

00:00:32.278 --> 00:00:37.470
how. Let's say we have an x coordinate of 3, well then y is going to equal 3

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.857
squared, which is just 9. However we also know that if we had negative 3 instead

00:00:42.857 --> 00:00:48.116
Well, negative three squared is also nine. Negative numbers and positive numbers

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:51.290
that the same absolute value, have the same squares.
