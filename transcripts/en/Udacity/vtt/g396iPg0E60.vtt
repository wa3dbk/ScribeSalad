A point light is what it sounds like. You define a position for it in space and

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.520
it gives off light in all directions. You can set the color and intensity just

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.124
as you can with directional lights. These lights are different from real world

00:00:11.124 --> 00:00:13.464
lights in that by default the distance from the light does not effect its

00:00:13.464 --> 00:00:17.544
brightness. Attenuation is not done mostly because it's easier to quickly light

00:00:17.544 --> 00:00:21.596
a scene with point lights if there's no drop off with distance. It's entirely

00:00:21.596 --> 00:00:24.262
possible to use a different equation for how the light is attenuated by the

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:27.745
distance. For example, you could divide the intensity by the distance or the

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:31.725
distance squared, which is how real lights work, or any other combination. 3JS

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:36.324
supports only one drop-off mode, which is to define a maximum distance. At this

00:00:36.324 --> 00:00:39.818
distance, the light goes to zero. This is entirely non-physical, but is useful

00:00:39.818 --> 00:00:43.372
for the artistic control of lighting. You can put point lights in a scene and

00:00:43.372 --> 00:00:46.102
have each affect a local area without affecting the lighting in other parts of

00:00:46.102 --> 00:00:47.560
the scene.
