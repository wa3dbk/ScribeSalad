00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.670
Here we have the red ball in the ball class. One has to do two things. First of

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.536
all, the ball must implement the drawable interface. And we need to supply a

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:14.856
draw method, in this case the method was very simple. It simply fills the

00:00:14.856 --> 00:00:21.080
circular shape. In the Scene class, we add a Ball, and that's it, nothing else

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.716
needs to be changed. The mechanism that does the drawing stays completely the

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:32.412
same. That's polymorphism in action. we have a general mechanism that can deal

00:00:32.412 --> 00:00:36.447
with any drawables. And if we want to add more, then we can simply add them

00:00:36.447 --> 00:00:39.690
without having to make any further changes.
