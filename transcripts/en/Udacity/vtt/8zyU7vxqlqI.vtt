00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Setting a different value for the mass is obviously

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
something that has to happen in the right-hand side.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The differential equations, as such, contains our physical model.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Determining the value at one precise instant of time

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is a job for the output.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Most probably it has to interpolate between values before and after,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because there is no step at exactly this instant of time.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So, this is O.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Stopping at the given time--that's a job for the driver.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It will stop the stepper.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Using an implicit method is tricky.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That's unclear.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Somebody would be responsible to solve the equation.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Who would that be?

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
There is no explicit right-hand side of that equation.
