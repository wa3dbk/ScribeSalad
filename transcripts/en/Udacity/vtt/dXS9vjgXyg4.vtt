00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.104
&gt;&gt; This is the sample from our general population, which you analyzed before

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.164
when you found the core tiles. To calculate our variability in the way we

00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:12.641
discussed from the last slide, we first need to calculate the mean. So find the

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:12.992
mean.
