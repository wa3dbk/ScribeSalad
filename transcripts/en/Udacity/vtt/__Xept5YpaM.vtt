00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.180
In this lesson, we've seen that

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.790
to manage entire patient populations
against the fine quality objectives.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.330
We've also seen that it
can be used to support and

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.390
enhance critical public health services,
such as disease surveillance.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.330
Having seen what can be done, we now
turn in lesson 9 to how it's done.
