00:00:00.058 --> 00:00:03.364
The answer--1,000 bins will probably be fastest.

00:00:03.364 --> 00:00:08.093
Since you're likely going to be limited by atomic performance, the histogram that offers the most bins is

00:00:08.093 --> 00:00:11.816
probably going to have the highest throughput--with a 1,000 bin histogram,

00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:16.556
1000 threads can be updating the histogram at any given time, whereas with a 10 bin

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:22.218
or a 100 bin histogram, only 10 or 100 bins can actually update the histogram at any time.
