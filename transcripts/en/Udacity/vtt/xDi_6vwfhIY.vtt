00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.160
Building architects use sketches and

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.910
blueprints to convey the architecture of a proposed building.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.600
Similarly, software architects use a variety of

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.610
notational devices called views for the same purpose.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.020
It's well to remember though that an architecture is not simply a picture,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.780
it is a set of these important design decisions made during

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.410
the course of thinking about how the building or

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.168
the software system is going to solve whatever problem it's suppose to solve.

00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:36.920
Specifically, software architecture conveys the set

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.310
of components that will together compute a solution

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.638
to the problem while satisfying or not violating any of the require

00:00:48.638 --> 00:00:54.520
non-functional constraints as specified in the requirements for the system.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.590
In this particular lesson we will look at a variety of different graphical and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.550
textual approaches for conveying software architecture views.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.360
We will start with Philip Kruchten's 4 plus 1 architectural views paper which I

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.820
asked you to read.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.770
And then we will add in some different views that go beyond what

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.648
he was talking about, the feature view,

00:01:16.648 --> 00:01:20.820
non-functional requirements, bug reporting, context, and utility views.
