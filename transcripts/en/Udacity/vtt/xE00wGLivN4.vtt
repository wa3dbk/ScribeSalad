You're going to create a graph. Here, I'm drawing the x-axis, which is age, and

00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:09.295
here I'm drawing the y-axis, which is frequency. You're going to make a bar

00:00:09.307 --> 00:00:14.035
graph for this data by clicking where the heights of each bar should be. So,

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:18.825
we'll have four bars, now click where the height of the first bar should be, the

00:00:18.837 --> 00:00:20.820
second, the third and the forth.
