00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.189
So, how would you use meta-reasoning to design an agent that can answer Raven's

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.240
progressive matrices? Throughout this course we've covered a wide variety of

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.030
different methods for addressing this test. And each method has its own

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.200
strength and its own weaknesses. Certain methods are better for some problems,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.640
and other methods for other problems. Meta-reasoning will tell us, though,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.330
that you don't have to choose just one. Your agent can have multiple methods to

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.300
choose from. Discuss how you might design an agent to have meta-reasoning.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.330
What methods would it have to choose from?

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.950
How will it evaluate a new problem and decide what method is best for

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.030
that problem? How much improvement do you really expect to see in

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.970
your agent's performance based on equipping it with meta-reasoning? And finally,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.530
will your agent engage in any kind of meta-meta-reasoning as we've discussed?

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.500
Will it not only think about the methods themselves but also about how it's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.490
selecting a method? And if so, how will that improve it even further?
