00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's move on to a slightly more complicated question:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
out of all the families with two kids--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
with at least 1 boy, born on a Tuesday--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
what's the probability of two boys?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, you might think that the answer should be the same--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
it should still be 1/3 because why does Tuesday matter?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
After all, the kid's gotta be born sometime

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and if it happens to be Tuesday,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
why would that be any different than any other day?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So is it 1/3?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well, as Gottfried Leibniz said, "Let us calculate."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So we have the technology to model that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
First, a random variable for day of the week-_

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and I had to fool around with the capitalization there,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to make sure that we have 7 distinct letters:

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday--

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
plus ample space of twokidsbday,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
one kid with their day of birth;

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the second kid, with their day of birth.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What does that look like? Well, it's this huge thing

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
of (2 X 7 X 2 X 7) entries.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The first one: Boy born on Sunday;

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
boy born on Sunday, all the way through

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to the last one: girl born on Saturday, girl born on Saturday.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Then a boy born on Tuesday is all the elements of this,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
where "BT" appears is in the string.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So either "BT" will be the first 2 characters or the last 2 characters.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And now we're finally at the point

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
where we can say: given at least 1 boy_tuesday,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
what's the probability of two_boys?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And before I show the results,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'm going to ask you what you think it is.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You could follow along, either with pencil and paper

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
or do the computation or just think it out in your head.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So Enter as a fraction. If you think it's 1/3,

00:01:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
put a 1 here and a 3 here--or whatever.
