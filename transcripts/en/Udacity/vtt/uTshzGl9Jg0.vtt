00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The two things I think you should do to figure out what set does is first do experiments.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is probably really the most pleasant and the way that most

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
programmers would want to understand new things.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Experiments are limited though.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If you really want to understand things, you'd probably need to read some documentation as well

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
or at least look for documents on the web that might give you more insight.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Playing tennis is probably fun and you'll learn something about sets

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but a different kind of set than we're using in Python.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
For the first choice, well I think the course forums are very valuable

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and I definitely encourage you to use them and to take advantage of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
other people learning the same things, but it's not a great way to start.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's really good to try some things on your own before you get

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
into the course forum and ask for help.
