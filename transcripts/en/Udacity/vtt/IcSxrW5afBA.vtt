00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.370
We've already seen how to change file
permissions using the chmod command.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.310
But what if you need to change
a files group or owner?

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.540
There are also commands
that allow you to do that.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.455
They are Chown.

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:14.400
C-H-O-W-N.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.555
And change group.

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:17.750
C-H-G-R-P.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.460
We'll play with this bash history file
here located on our home directory.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.320
Its permissions are set so only
the owner can read and write the file.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.700
This file stores a recent history of
every command the user has typed, so

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.950
it's for security reasons only that
the user can read and modify the file.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.860
If you run cat on bash history,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.230
you'll see that we can
currently read this file.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.410
If we change the file's group to root
using this command sudo chgrp root and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.270
then then name of the file.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.070
If we try to cat this file again,
you'll see that we can still read it.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.890
The group has no permissions on this
file, so there's pretty much no effect.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.620
Our ability to read this file right now
is determined by the owner setting,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.660
not the group setting.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.230
But now, if we change the owner
to root of the bash history file,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.300
you'll see that we can
no longer read the file.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.790
Permission is denied, and this is
because only the owner can read and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.565
write the file and that owner's root.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.500
Our current user student would
fall in the everyone category and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.440
they have no permission
at all to read this file.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.090
Go ahead and change the owner and
the group back to student on this file.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.030
We were just experimenting
to show these commands and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.100
when you might need to use them.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.160
Now let's move on to the last security
topic we'll discuss, firewalls.
