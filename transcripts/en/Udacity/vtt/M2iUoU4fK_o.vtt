00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.660
We introduce QRDA, the standard for
query results, in lesson eight.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.910
You should recall that the results can
be reported at three levels of detail.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.560
The patient level,
a list of patients, or

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.260
an aggregated level across
a group of patients.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.500
In this example of QRDA XML,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.170
two templates are utilized
to specify NQF

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.070
defined quality measures for
inpatient asthma care and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.020
the use of systemic corticosteroids for
inpatient asthma patients.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.980
Each of which, of course,
has its own complex definition.
