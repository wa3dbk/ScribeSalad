Now that our world of numbers is labeled
with categories, let's put some numbers in it.

00:00:05.656 --> 00:00:11.262
Here are a bunch of numbers. Type the
letter that corresponds to each number in

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:17.258
the proper box in the diagram. Remember,
that on the diagram, numbers are

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:23.784
positioned in the smallest set they belong
in or is far into the graph as they can be placed.
