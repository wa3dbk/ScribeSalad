00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.828
The course that you just did can help us start to see the connection between

00:00:02.828 --> 00:00:07.008
our two functions here. Let's see if we can really pin down this relationship

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:12.214
is though. If we have a point a,b that we know allies in the function where y

00:00:12.214 --> 00:00:17.759
equals 10x plus 150. Then do we know anything about a point on our other

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.650
function, y equals x over 10 minus 15. Please pick the statement that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.860
accurately completes this sentence.
