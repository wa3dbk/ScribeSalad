00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.710
Not all Android users interact with
their devices in the same way.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.340
And that is why it is important to make
sure your app is usable by anyone.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.370
This includes users who have visual,
physical or age related limitations

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.800
that prevent them from fully seeing or
using a touch screen.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.810
And users with hearing loss who
may not be able to perceive

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.860
audible information and alerts.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.420
To make these considerations easy for

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.730
developers, Android provides
accessibility features that help

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.010
users navigate their devices more
easily including text-to-speech,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.870
haptic feedback, gesture navigation,
trackball and directional navigation.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.710
Even better, our experts have created a
nifty checklist to help developers know

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.500
what to focus on when making
their apps accessible.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.660
So, let's take a look.
