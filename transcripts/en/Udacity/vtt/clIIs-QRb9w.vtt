00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.475
For our first problem, we'll have 24x squared and for our second problem we'll

00:00:04.475 --> 00:00:09.770
have 9 plus 3 times the square root of 6. Nice thinking for getting those two

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.800
correct. For the first problem, we just want to multiply the radicands

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.972
together. So we'll have 4 times 16, which equals 64, and x squared times x

00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:22.638
squared, which equals x to the 4th. The square root of 64 is 8 and the square

00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:28.800
root of x to the 4th is x squared. We want to make sure that we multiply these

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.456
factors that come out by 3. So we'll have 24x squared for our final result. For

00:00:33.456 --> 00:00:38.640
the second problem we distribute or multiply 3 root 3 times each of each these

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.940
terms. Here we'll multiply root 3 times root 3 to get 3. We still have a 3 in

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.606
front of these two radicals, so we'll have 3 times 3, which equals 9. Then for

00:00:49.606 --> 00:00:54.314
the second term, we'll have 3 root 3, times root 2. We just multiply these two

00:00:54.314 --> 00:00:58.556
radicals together to get 3 root 6. There's a 1 in front of the square root of

00:00:58.556 --> 00:01:03.536
2, which is what we multiplied the 3 by. 3 times 1 equals 3 and 3 times 2 is

00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:09.395
equal to 6. This one's underneath the root. We can't combine the 9 and the 3

00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:14.452
root 6, since 9 doesn't have a square root of 6 on the end. These aren't like

00:01:14.452 --> 00:01:17.483
terms. So this is our final result.
