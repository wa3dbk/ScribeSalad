00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.830
Congratulations on
completing this course.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.689
At this point, you've deployed
Hadoop clusters manually,

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.151
automatically with and on demand
with Amazon's Elastic MapReduce.

00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:14.380
&gt;From here, I suggest looking into
the vast configuration options.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.730
Things like adjusting the block size,
the number of mappers and reducers, and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.679
compressing the mapper output can make
your jobs run much more efficiently.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.490
I'll give you some links to
information on these configurations.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.730
Now you're ready to
tackle big data projects.
