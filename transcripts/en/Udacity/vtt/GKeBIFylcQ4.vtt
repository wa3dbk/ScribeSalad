00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.670
Today, we'd like to revisit the TextBrowser example that we started

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.830
the class with earlier. And this time we want to come at it from the point of

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.060
view of it's architecture. In particular, we want to suggest a process that

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.730
might be useful in actually performing an architectural design. Note that

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.560
this lesson uses UML diagrams and constraints to describe system architecture.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.319
And there are, there is a paper on the class resources page by Stirewatt and

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:33.810
Rugaber. That that comments on several of the points we're going to be making.
