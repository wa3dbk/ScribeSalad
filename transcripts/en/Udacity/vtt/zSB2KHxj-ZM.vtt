00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
Now, I don't know about you, but every time I come across the halting problem,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.510
I cannot buy the mathematical arguments, but I still feel some would cheat it.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.780
It's important I think to realize what is being implied by undecidability and what is not being implied.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.540
Informally, all that the undecidability of the halting problem says

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.960
is that you cannot analyze every aspect of computation using computation.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.270
Let's say this program here is supposed to solve the halting problem.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.170
This would be the program halt here.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.120
The difficulty lies in the fact that all this required not only to be able to say what one given program

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.070
program two does, and of course, we'll assume there's also an input,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.000
but basically, it's supposed to be able to say this for an infinite number of programs.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.910
Now, the following is by no means a scientific explanation,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.050
but I think it's a good way to think about it.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.110
If we have the requirement that halt must be able to look at every other problem here

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.810
then halt will also be part of this list.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.180
So somewhere in that stack of programs, you will have halt.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.019
Now, if you say halt must be more complex, and again, this is not a scientific explanation

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.810
must be more complex that any program it's looking at,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.990
well, then halt must be more complex than halt itself,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.230
which of course is to an infinite cycle of complexity.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.210
So here, we cannot have this spiral of infinity, which of course cannot be so there's the error right there,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.410
and again, this is just an intuition a way which I like to think about it.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.020
You may find other ways more convenient.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.760
What I find is with undecidability and especially the halting problem

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.250
there is a lot of misunderstandings and pitfalls.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.020
And actually, I would now like to go with you through one of the most common pitfalls

00:01:35.020 --> 99:59:59.000
regarding the halting problem and its undecidability.
