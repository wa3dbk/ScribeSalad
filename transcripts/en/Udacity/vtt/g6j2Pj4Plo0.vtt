00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.530
Now that we talked about completeness and pertinence, let's consider an

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.200
information system for a gym. I'm going to give you a

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.580
list of possible requirements and I want you to mark in

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.530
that list all the requirements that you believe are pertinent. So let

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.030
me read the list. Members of the gym shall be able

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.770
to access their training programs. The system shall be able to

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.894
read member cards. The system shall be able to store members'

00:00:21.894 --> 00:00:25.150
commute time. Personal trainers shall be able to add clients. And the

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.570
list of members shall be stored as a linked list.
