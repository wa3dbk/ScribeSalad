00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is the box over here.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Some of you might have chosen this box, but I'll tell you in a second why this is the better box.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is the resulting pie chart where the red class is 20-32,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and the remaining  black class is the age group 33 and older.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now let's do the math.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
To understand what area the red curve will occupy, we're going to divide 96,000

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
by the total number of students, which is 96/144.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It happens to be the same as 8/12.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now, the 8 mark is the one over here, but I chose the 9 mark.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This is the 9 mark--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The reason is one mark has already been used up by the first class,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and now we incrementally add 8 to those to arrive over here.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The surface area in the pie shown in red really corresponds to 8/12 of the total surface area.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If we now plug in the final class of 36,000 students, which is the same as 36/144 or 3/12,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
you'll find this area over here occupies exactly 3/12 of the total area.

00:01:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Hence this is the correct pie chart.
