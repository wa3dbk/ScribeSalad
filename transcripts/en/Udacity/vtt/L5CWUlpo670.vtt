00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.910
So here's the answer. We can do this

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.730
using the find method. What we want to do is

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.740
find in the search string page the target string

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.340
a href. So we can do that with code

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.150
like this. We're going to have start link as

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.700
the variable that we're initializing. That's going to be the

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.355
left side of the assignment. And we're going to set

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:25.670
its value to the result of calling find where

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.840
page is the search string and the target string

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.930
is a href equals. And that will give start link

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.290
the value of a number, which is the position

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.090
where the first link tag is found on the page.
