00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:04.487
And the answer is 1, 211. Let’s plug-in zero.

00:00:04.487 --> 00:00:08.204
2 factorial is 2 divided by 2 factorial gives

00:00:08.204 --> 00:00:11.814
us 1 and zero factorial is 1. So that’s 1 over

00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:15.082
here. But if you plug-in 1SK we get 2 factorial

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:17.662
over here which is 2 divided by and another

00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:21.662
1 stays 2. So this is the correct answer.
