00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.313
So we have seen that using the ROB

00:00:02.313 --> 00:00:06.263
and something like the Tomasulo algorithm, we can enforce

00:00:06.263 --> 00:00:10.622
the order of dependencies on registers between instructions.

00:00:10.622 --> 00:00:14.120
The question still remains what about memory access ordering?

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.050
We have a lot of store instructions. Do

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.180
they really need to be done strictly in program

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.380
order, or can we do something about reordering

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.860
them too? So far, we have eliminated control dependencies,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.790
using branch prediction, and eliminated false dependencies

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.570
on registers, that is dependencies that go through

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.620
registers, and we have eliminated the false dependencies

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.680
through register renaming. Next, we learn how to

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.620
obey read after write register dependencies or

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.230
through dependencies. And we do that through Tamasulo-like

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.250
scheduling. So we have instructions wait in reservation

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.250
stations until their dependencies have been satisfied and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.470
they can proceed to execution out of program

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.330
order. Note that the data dependence handling that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.780
we have done so for, however, is only

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.734
for register dependencies. That is when one instruction

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:04.846
is producing a value in a register that

00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:08.378
another is going to be using. But what about

00:01:08.378 --> 00:01:11.910
memory dependencies? If we have a store and

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.330
then a load, there could also be a dependence

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.020
between the memory value written by the store and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.640
then the value read by the load. If these two

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.390
addresses are the same address then actually the load

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.430
needs to get the value from the store and in

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.080
which case we should be doing them in order.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.088
However, if these two addresses are not the same, just

00:01:33.088 --> 00:01:36.416
like with registers, we actually don't need to maintain the

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:40.346
program order between this accesses. However, we have not seen

00:01:40.346 --> 00:01:43.750
anything that handle out of order execution of memory instruction.
