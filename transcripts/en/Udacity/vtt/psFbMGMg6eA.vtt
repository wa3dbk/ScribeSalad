00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.731
All together, customers canceled orders for 3 wiper blades and 12 nozzles. How,

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:09.421
then, should be represent the money that Grant would have made from those now

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:14.202
canceled orders? Please remember that w is equal to the price per wiper set and

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:18.505
n is equal to the price per nozzle. So again, I only want you to take into

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:22.661
account the money that Grant would have earned from the three wiper blade sets

00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:25.147
and the 12 nozzle orders that have now been canceled.
