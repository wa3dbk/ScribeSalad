Light emitters can take whatever form you like since, ultimately, the effect of

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.445
a light is something computed in the vertex or fragment shading. That said,

00:00:06.445 --> 00:00:09.850
there are a few different common forms of lights used in applications. The

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.130
simplest is called a directional light. This type of light is defined by just

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.252
that, a direction vector. A directional light is something like the sun. The

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:20.024
direction to the sun is essentially the same for every object on earth, and a

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:24.222
directional light is considered infinitely far away. In many modelers, such as

00:00:24.222 --> 00:00:27.498
the 3JS editor here, the directional light will be shown as some local point

00:00:27.498 --> 00:00:31.858
that you can move around. However, you're truly manipulating the direction, not

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:35.114
the location of the light. Since we often combine colors in various ways,

00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:39.080
there's not necessarily an upper limit of 1.0 to a color channel. It all

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.945
depends. For example, if I want a clear the screen, I would want to use values

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:46.088
from zero to one. There's an upper limit of each channel's intensity, so values

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:50.212
larger than 1.0 are beyond the monitor's abilities. However, if I wanted to

00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:53.949
make the light bright, I might set its intensity to 11. When the distance from

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.450
the light to the object and the object's color are taken into account, the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.890
final color may well be within the zero to one range. In some systems, you can

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.794
even set the light intensity to a negative number, meaning the light is somehow

00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:07.650
sucking photons from the surface. The light's color is just a number in an

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.138
equation after all. This is true for a material's color too, that it could be

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:14.114
set however you want, but we tend to leave material colors between zero and

00:01:14.114 --> 00:01:18.782
one, thinking of them as reflectivities. These basic illumination equations are

00:01:18.782 --> 00:01:21.491
not based on any physical unit, such as watts or lumens, but rather are set in

00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:24.310
the zero to one range for our convenience.
