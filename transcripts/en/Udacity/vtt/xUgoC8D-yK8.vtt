00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.250
This is the simplified fraction, fantastic work if you found it. I think it's

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.070
best to start by reducing the factors of x plus one and x plus five. These

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.330
factors in the numerator and denominator cancel or reduce to one. I don't want

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.630
to forget about these monomial terms, but everything looks a little confusing

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.353
right now. So I'm going to rewrite my line. So we have two x-squared, times x

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:26.008
plus three, times two x minus five, for our numerator. For the denominator we

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:31.462
have x minus 3 times 6x times 2x plus 1. Notice that I switched the order of

00:00:31.462 --> 00:00:35.824
this 6x and this x minus 3. We can do that since we're multiplying here. We know

00:00:35.824 --> 00:00:41.130
the multiplication is commutative. We know 2/6 reduces to 1/3 so I can simplify

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.654
this fraction. We can also simplify our powers of x we have x squared in the

00:00:45.654 --> 00:00:50.253
numerator and 1 x in the denominator so we'll be left with 1 x in our numerator

00:00:50.253 --> 00:00:55.128
in our final answer. I'll show it more easily by writing x squared as x times x.

00:00:55.128 --> 00:01:01.050
We simplify each of these x's since they really equal 1, and 2 divided by 2

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.663
equals 1, and 2 into 6 equals 3. This gives us our final answer.
