You might have guessed that the perimeter is the distance around an object. So

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:09.273
if I just add up the distances around an object, I can find the perimeter. For

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:13.510
this one, I have 2 d's and, and 2 3's, so the perimeter is 2d plus 6. The d's

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:17.870
have the same length, so we can add them together. They're like terms. The

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:22.290
perimeter of this shape is 2a plus 3b. We don't know the length of these two

00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:26.683
sides, but we can add them together because they're both a, they have the same

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:31.039
length. The same is true for the b's. Be careful that you don't write 5ab here.

00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:35.569
We can't combine these two terms. a is one number, and b is another number. I'm

00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:40.036
not multiplying, I'm really adding the distances around the object. If you got

00:00:40.048 --> 00:00:41.550
these two right, nice work.
