00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.015
Now let's look that the answers. The first
set, -4, 1, and 5 is indeed a subset of

00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:12.358
the original set because all of the
numbers contained in the subset are in the

00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:21.263
original set. Let's look at the second
subset, -3, -2, 0, and 5. Since -2 is not

00:00:21.263 --> 00:00:28.190
in the original set, this cannot be a
subset of the original set. Looking at the

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:35.910
subset zero. Zero is, indeed, in the
original set. So that the set zero would

00:00:35.922 --> 00:00:43.820
be a subset of the original set. Let's
look at the set. 0.5, 0.6, 1, and 2. There

00:00:43.832 --> 00:00:50.356
are a couple of numbers there that are not
in the original set so that, that set

00:00:50.368 --> 00:00:56.942
would not be a subset of the original. Now
let's look at the set 4,5. Again the

00:00:56.954 --> 00:01:04.197
number four is not in the original set so
this is not a subset of the original. And

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:10.697
the last set, 5 and 8. Both of these
numbers are in the original set, so this

00:01:10.697 --> 00:01:14.926
is indeed a subset of the original set.
