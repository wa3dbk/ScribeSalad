00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, implement the shift of the curve. There's no diffusion, no heat loss, no combustion.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's just about shifting the curve.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The velocity is already specified and we have different initial conditions.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, it's just the sine wave. We'll experiment with that in a second.

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You can already have a look at what's happening at the boundaries. They are pretty ugly.
