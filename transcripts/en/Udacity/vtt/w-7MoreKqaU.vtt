00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.570
So you just calculated the point estimate. What about our interval estimate?

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.495
Because we know that the population mean will probably be somewhere around 0.13.

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:14.554
And remember this is the population mean if we gave everyone an access to this

00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:19.306
musical lesson. So what's the standard error of the mean that we would use to

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:24.042
compare this sample mean with the means of other samples of the same size from

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:27.663
this population? Again round to the nearest thousandths.
