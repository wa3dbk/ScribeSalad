00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.760
If you walk up to typical computer today, you're

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.370
likely to find several applications open. One for listening

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.470
to music. One for playing your video game. A

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.320
web browser displaying information on some ancient culture from some

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.420
remote corner of the world. And a messaging application

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.400
for connecting with friends, and so on. How is it

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.190
possible for a single device to do all these

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.480
things, and moreover, do them all at the same time?

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.080
How can all these diverse applications, written by

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.550
different programmers who don't even know each other,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.930
coordinate? Who's in charge here? The answer of

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.210
course is the operating system. Hello and welcome to

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.400
CS6210 Advanced Operating Systems. My name is Kishore

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.310
Ramachandran and I'll be taking you on a

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.730
journey to understand the role played by the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.950
operating system in providing the rich user experience afforded

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.680
to modern applications, the modern computers. And

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.580
along the way, I'll highlight the symbiotic relationship

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.270
between hardware and software that makes it

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.379
possible for the computer and the operating system

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.740
to provide the rich user experience to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.430
please you. Operating systems have evolved over time.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.990
In this course we will see all the advances that have been made in the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.930
operating system that has led to the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.550
state of the art in operating systems today.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.380
Covering a variety of platforms, from cell

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.460
phones to multi-core, to parallel systems, to distributive

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.130
computing and cloud computing. In part one

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.240
of this introductory lesson, my goal is to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.990
primarily talk about the power of abstraction.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.080
That will lay the foundation for the rest

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.240
of the introductory lesson, which will

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.170
include an overview of the hardware resources

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.260
managed by the operating system. The operating

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.960
system functionality that is expected, and the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.510
abstractions in an operating system for

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.810
managing the hardware resources. By the end

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.590
of the lesson, we will be ready to discuss the structure of operating systems.
