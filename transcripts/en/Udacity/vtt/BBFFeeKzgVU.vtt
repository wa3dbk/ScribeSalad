00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.005
Let's switch gears and talk a little bit about sleep and dreaming, and how that

00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:08.935
relates to our consciousness. So why do we sleep? Is our brain responsive while

00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:12.489
we sleep? Can we hear while we sleep? Can we be consciously aware of our

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:16.440
dreams? All of these are types of questions that psychologists have researched

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.358
for a really long time. And we're going to go over a few of the answers in this

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:25.060
section of the lesson. We're going to look at the biological purpose of sleep.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.640
What happens during sleep, and what happens if we don't get enough sleep? I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.840
promise you, it's not good, because sleep is imperative for us to function as

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.370
healthy human beings. We really need sleep for both our physical and mental

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.199
health. So let's start by looking at our sleep patterns.
