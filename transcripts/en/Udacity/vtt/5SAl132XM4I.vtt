00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.232
Here's one last simplification that I want to show you. Again, there's multiple

00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:08.192
ways to do that type of problem. So, I'm going to show you two, and you choose

00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:12.238
what you prefer. In the first way, I'm going to start outside the parenthesis

00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:16.315
and take care of this negative exponent. I do the reciprocal of the entire

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:20.650
inside parenthesis to get 1 over 3a to the 4th, b to the negative 3 squared.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.797
Next, I square each factor in the parenthesis. 1 squared is 1. 3 squared is 9. A

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:31.617
to the 4th squared is a to the 8th. And b to the negative 3 squared is b to the

00:00:31.617 --> 00:00:36.179
negative 6. Finally, we move b to the negative 6 to the numerator for our final

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:40.629
result. The second way of doing this problem is starting inside the parentheses.

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.777
We can move any negative exponents to the denominator. So I have 3a to the 4th

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:49.241
divided by b cubed, and then all of this is raised to the negative 2. We have a

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:53.499
fraction that's a base raised to a negative exponent. So we take the reciprocal

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.036
of this entire fraction and change the exponent to be positive. Finally, b cubed

00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:02.273
squared is b to the 6, 3 squared is 9, and a to the 4 squared is a to the 8th.

00:01:02.273 --> 00:01:06.480
Here's our anwer. Both of these results are the same. So we know our work is

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.755
correct. In the first case, i started with a negative exponent here. Then I

00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:15.385
handled the negative exponent on the inside. For the second case, I handled this

00:01:15.385 --> 00:01:19.740
negative exponent on the inside first, then I did the negative exponent on the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.772
outside. You'll have to move terms around either way you do it, just get

00:01:23.772 --> 00:01:25.293
comfortable with one way.
