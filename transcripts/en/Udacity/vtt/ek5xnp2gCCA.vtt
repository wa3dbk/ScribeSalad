Context-free grammars always produce a finite number of utterances.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
No. This one produces an infinite number of utterances.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I can keep looping around rule one as many times as I want.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And in fact, this is one of the glories of context-free grammars--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that they can often accept an infinite number strings,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
thus, giving you room for creativity based on just a finite grammar.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Context-free grammars can capture a^N b^N.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Yes. It looks like this. Just like the balanced parentheses one but with "ab" instead.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So by "yes" I of course meant "Yes."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Context-free grammars are more powerful than regular expressions. Yes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Here, more powerful or more expressive means that there are some languages--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
remember, a language is set of string--that context-free grammars

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
can recognize that regular expressions cannot.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is one of them, a^N b^N can't be captured by regular expressions,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but it can be done by context-free grammars. Therefore, they are more powerful.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Context-free grammars can tell if a program declares a variable before using it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
No. If you think back to our grammars for JavaScript, we couldn't tell the difference

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
between a variable that had been declared than one that had not been yet.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That's a context-sensitive property. We won't be able to check it with context-free grammars.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We could only notice that later when we are doing interpreting or in a statically typed language

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
if we were type-checking things to make sure we are using integers and strings correctly.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We might also check to see which variables were in scope.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But in general, it's very hard to tell if a variable has already been used.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That depends on the previous program. That previous program is the context.

00:01:27.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Context-free grammars don't get any context.
