00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In a bar chart, we take our raw data and pull it together.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
For example, we might say all the data that falls into this interval over here

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
should be summarized by a single value.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Such a value would lie halfway in between these two data points

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and form what's called a bar.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Similarly, we might pull together this data over here into a single bar and so on.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let me ask you a question. What is the height in terms of the dollar figure

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
for the very first bar?
