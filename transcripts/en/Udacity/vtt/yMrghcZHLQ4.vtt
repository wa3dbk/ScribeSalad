If you got 5x minus 2y equals negative 4, you did a great job. Let's see how we

00:00:06.687 --> 00:00:12.975
got that answer. Remember, the first thing we have to do is find the slope

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:19.412
between these two points. We know that the equation for slope is y2 minus y1

00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:25.399
over x2 minus x1. Now, to make sure I put the values in the right places, I

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:31.876
always label one of the my points, x1, y1 and the other point, x2, y2. That way,

00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:38.221
I make sure I plug them into the right places. So when I find the slope, y2

00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:45.541
minus y1 is, y2 is 7, minus y1 is negative 3 over x2 which is 2 minus x1 which

00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:53.804
is negative 2. 7 minus negative 3 is 10. 2 minus negative 2 is 4 and 10 over 4

00:00:53.804 --> 00:01:02.147
can be reduced to 5 halves. So we know that the slope of our line. So we know

00:01:02.147 --> 00:01:08.727
the slope of our line is 5 halves. Now that we know the slope, we can find the

00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:14.145
equation of the line. In order to find the equation of the line, we use the

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:19.620
equation m equals y minus y1 over x minus x1. Now I plug in what I know. The

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.172
slope is 5 halves, and that's going to equal y minus y1, y1 is negative 3 over x

00:01:26.172 --> 00:01:34.854
minus x1 which is x minus negative 2. Let's go ahead and write these again. 5

00:01:34.854 --> 00:01:43.211
halves equals y minus negative 3 is y plus 3 and x minus a negative 2 is x plus

00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:50.887
2. Now I can simply cross multiply. When I cross multiply, I have 5 times x plus

00:01:50.887 --> 00:01:58.577
2 equals 2 times y plus 3. I have to remember to distribute. After I distribute,

00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:05.204
I have 5x, plus 5 times 2 is 10, equals 2y plus 2 times 3 is 6. Since I want

00:02:05.204 --> 00:02:11.000
this equation in standard form, I'd need the x and y terms on the left side and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.846
the constant on the right side. So, I can subtract 10 from both sides to move

00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:22.901
the constant over to the right. And I have 5x equals 2y minus 4. 6 plus negative

00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:29.810
10 is negative 4. And then I have to subtract 2y from both sides. And I get a

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.994
final answer of 5x minus 2y equals negative 4.
