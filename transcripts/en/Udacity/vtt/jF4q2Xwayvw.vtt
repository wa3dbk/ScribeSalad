Well, check it out. When I'm at the x intercept, I'm right on the x axis. So

00:00:04.784 --> 00:00:09.698
this means that the y coordinate is zero. Likewise, for the y intercept, I'm

00:00:09.698 --> 00:00:14.755
right on the y axis. Which mean the x coordinate is zero. These statements will

00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:17.884
always be true for x intercepts and y intercepts.
