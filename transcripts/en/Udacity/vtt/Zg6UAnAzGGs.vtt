00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.150
The plan for the lesson is this.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.340
We'll start by defining bipartite
graphs, the concept of matchings and

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.029
some other needed ideas.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.380
Then we'll show how the problem
of finding a maximum matching

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.510
can be reduced to the problem
of finding a maximum flow.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.360
And this will give us
an E times V algorithm.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.460
Next, we'll show that the Vertex Cover
problem is related to the max

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.520
matching problem.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.140
Much in the same way that
the minimum cut problem

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.460
was related to the Max-Flow problem.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.750
And finally, we'll give
the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.016
show that it finds a maximum matching in
time order E times the square root of V.

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:37.171
There are many good references on
the topic of maximum matchings and

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:38.800
bipartite graphs.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.135
This lesson will follow
most closely Kleinberg and

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:44.510
Tardos' Algorithm Design for
the first three parts.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.760
And Dexter Kozen's, The Design and
Analysis of Algorithms, for

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.840
the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.040
We begin our discussion by defining
the notion of a Bipartite Graph.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.860
An undirected graph is bipartite if
there exists partition into L and

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.050
R, think left and right.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.110
Such that every edge has one
vertex in L and one in R.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.967
For example,
this graph here is bipartite.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:13.010
I can label the green vertices as L,
and the orange ones as R.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.980
And then every edge has one vertex,
that's green and one that's orange.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.920
A few observations are in order.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.932
First, saying that a graph is
bipartite is equivalent to saying

00:01:23.932 --> 00:01:28.340
that's 2-colorable, for those of you
who are familiar with colorings.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.910
Next, let's take the same graph and add
this edge here to make it non-bipartite.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.350
Note that I've introduced
an odd-length cycle.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.906
And indeed, saying that a graph is
bipartite is equivalent to saying

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:43.460
that it has no odd-length cycles.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.170
For graphs that aren't connected,
it's possible that there will be some

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.700
ambiguity in the partition
of the vertices.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.960
So sometimes the partition is
included in the definition.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.630
And we also often draw the graphs

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.780
with all the vertices in
one partition on the left.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.120
And all the vertices in the other
partition on the right.
