00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.776
One important element in making a virtual world seem real is collision

00:00:02.776 --> 00:00:06.400
detection and response. Collision detection is just that, you detect whether

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.748
two objects have moved such that they overlap. Even modest forms of collision

00:00:10.748 --> 00:00:13.066
detection can make a user feel that they're in a virtual world instead of a

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:16.772
ghost that can pass through anything. For example, simply shooting a ray from

00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:19.676
the user's location and finding the distance to the closest intersection will

00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:23.976
reveal whether the user's position should be adjusted. Where the problem begins

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:27.595
to get complex is when you have many objects in a scene. With a brute force

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:31.580
approach you compare everything to everything else for collision. Much of the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.100
efficient collision detection coding is in creating data structures that

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.516
quickly call out possible collisions that can't occur in a frame. The other

00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:41.078
half of the problem is collision response, what to do when two objects are

00:00:41.078 --> 00:00:44.568
found to have collided. This depends on a number of variables, including the

00:00:44.568 --> 00:00:48.730
velocity of the objects, and in this case, the elasticity of the materials.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.414
Collision detection is done primarily on the CPU in most programs at this

00:00:51.414 --> 00:00:54.098
point, though there have been some moves to off load the work to the GPU, or

00:00:54.098 --> 00:00:58.896
even custom chips. This is a complex subject, entire books have been written

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:01.130
about it, but this is all we'll cover here.
