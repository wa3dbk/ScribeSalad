To fetch the data from open weather map within an

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.750
app, first we need to make an HTTP request to the

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.150
API at the URL that we decided on earlier. Then we

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.520
need to read the response from the input stream to get

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.480
a JSON string. It hasn't been parsed yet, but we'll worry

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.080
about that later. Then we clean up by disconnecting the connection

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.300
and closing any input streams. We also log any errors that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.300
we catch. Since it's a lot of networking boiler plate code,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.500
we've provided you with a code snippet

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.890
that handles these steps. See the link for

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.990
the GitHub gist below. After you've taken a

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.120
