00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.700
As we complete that function,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.300
the context moves back out to the global context and we run it again.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.380
Running it again creates a second blue context that is distinct from the first.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.310
The new deed variable is added to the new context and running the log function,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.410
the first line creates a new deed variable that is distinct from the first.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.750
And the log function should have a different behavior this time.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.030
What would you expect the output to be now?
