00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.694
I'm printing a table and need to format some strings. Help me write the

00:00:03.694 --> 00:00:08.220
formatting strings for printing each of these values. What width goes here and

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.870
what letter goes here if I want to print six characters wide? What format

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.687
string goes here if I want two decimal places four characters wide? And format

00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:22.989
string goes here. The types of the variables are important.
