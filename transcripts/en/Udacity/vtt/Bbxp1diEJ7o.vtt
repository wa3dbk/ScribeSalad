00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.430
Just like before, we substitute in our x-coordinate in the spot of x and our

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:09.040
y-coordinate in the spot of y, then we just simplify. For the left hand side, we

00:00:09.052 --> 00:00:13.545
end up with 34. For the right hand side, we start out with 34, and there aren't

00:00:13.557 --> 00:00:17.990
any variables involved in this expression. Since we don't have any place to

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:23.633
substitute anything in We can just say 34 is equal to 34. And again, looking at

00:00:23.645 --> 00:00:29.527
these two sides and how they compare, 34 is still equal to 34. So, yes, these

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.284
two sides are equal. That means that we can say, that even though we may not

00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:40.564
have any idea what this curve looks like, we know that this point lies on this

00:00:40.576 --> 00:01:25.952
line. You might see some equations like this later on in the course. Get

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
excited.
