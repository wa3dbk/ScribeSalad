00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.620
We discussed access control
in the last lesson.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.990
But that was only one kind
of access control called

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.710
discretionary access control, or DAC.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.830
That allows you to decide

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.180
who you want to share a resource with
when you create the resource and own it.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.850
If you work for a company, or
a defense or intelligence organization,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.750
you don't get to decide how information
that you access can be shared.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.820
The company or the agency will mandate

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.008
how various types of information
is accessed by different users.

00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:40.470
For this, we're going to develop
a number of mandatory access control,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.800
also called MAC, models.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.900
Once we're done with,
this we're going to revisit the idea of

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.400
a trusted computing base, or
a TCB, and explore how we can

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.680
evaluate the level of assurance
that is provided by such a TCB.
