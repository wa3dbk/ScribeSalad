00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through it together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
1 plus blank equals 2, this is pretty much just 1. 1 plus 1 equals 2.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Just like in Python, JavaScript supports string concatenation using addition.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I didn't tell you about this explicitly, but I did tell you to use your Python intuition.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We're going to fill in this blank with one as well,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but this one is a string O-N-E.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The string P-H plus the string O-N-E will equal the string P-H-O-N-E.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Over here this is perhaps the trickiest on the screen.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In order for this whole expression to be True,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
both of these sub-expressions,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
both of these conjuncts if you prefer mathematics have to be true.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
X must be equal to 8 and this complicated math over here must also be true.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Well, if x is equal to 8 then x divided by 2 is 4.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
X divided by 2 equals 4 should return True.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This'll be true on the left and true on the right.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Finally, over here, what's anything that we could put in this blank that would

00:01:03.000 --> 09:59:59.000
possibly make this expression turn true? J\ust write out the Boolean constant True.
