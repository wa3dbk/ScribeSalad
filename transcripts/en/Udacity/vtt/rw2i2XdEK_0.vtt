00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.488
For the x intercept, we're at negative 3, 0. We start at the origin and move

00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:09.287
three units left and zero units vertically, here. For the y intercept, we start

00:00:09.287 --> 00:00:13.381
at the origin. We move zero units horizontally and then four units up

00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:17.931
vertically, so here. We know two points to determine our line so we draw our

00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:22.245
line in here. Great work if you chose the correct intercepts.
