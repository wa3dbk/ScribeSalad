00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.300
The rest of this class we're going to be talking about classes, which

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.600
are the way we make our own types in Python. The syntax to

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.940
define a new type in Python is to use class, followed by

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.320
the class name. This is the name you make up, such as web

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.270
corpus. And I'll explain what this means in the next unit. For

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.000
all the classes in this unit we'll just use object here. And inside

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.280
the class there's the block. This is like the block inside a

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.290
function, except inside the class, the

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.810
block is mostly going to contain definitions, and

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.010
they're going to be definitions of functions. We'll talk more about why

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.300
that is and what we're using them for. So instead of

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.800
using the search engine example in today's classes, I'll leave that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.550
for you to do in the homework. We're going to choose classes

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.610
using another example, inspired by one of our students, Andrew who

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.930
built a company perfect menu. You can read more about that

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.000
in the Udacity Blog, it's quite an inspiring story. And we're

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.810
going to think about what we will need to do to represent

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.240
restaurants and menus and things like that if we were going to

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.390
build a site similar to what Andrew built. So let's assume we

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.040
want to build a site to store restaurant menus. That means we

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.950
probably need some way to represent restaurants. So we want to make

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.050
our own type. So we'll do that by making a class. We'll

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.290
call it restaurant. And we will make the base class object. We're

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.105
going to talk more about what that means later, but for now that's

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:16.350
going to be something that we put in all of our class definitions.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.050
And for the body of the class we do need something. We'll

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.030
just have a doc string. And a doc string is just a string

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.890
that comes right after a definition. In this case, right after the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.850
class. It should provide some useful

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.580
documentation, so people understand what the object

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.130
is. You'll notice that I used an upper case letter for the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.780
name of the type. This is just a convention. And if you have

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.497
a long class name with multiple words, you want to use what's

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:41.630
known as Camel case. And this is a many-humped camels, I don't know

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.370
if they have camels with that many humps. They're probably a

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.280
little unstable. But the idea is to make it so you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.430
can see the separate words using uppercase letters. This is just

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.780
a convention, in other contexts in Python we would use underscores to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.320
separate them. But for class names we use uppercase and lowercase

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.460
letters. This is all we need to define a new type.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.760
We're defining a type named Restaurant. And we can put that

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.660
in a separate file. We'll put that in a file called restaurant.py.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.490
It's not necessary to put classes in their

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.860
own modules, but if it's an important class,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.460
which a restaurant probably would be for this

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.330
application, it's a good idea to do so.
