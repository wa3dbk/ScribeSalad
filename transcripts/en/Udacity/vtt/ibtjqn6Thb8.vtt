00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.112
&gt;&gt; So the first thing we need to do is actually fetch the graphics context from

00:00:03.112 --> 00:00:06.222
the tile its been passed in. Now this is going to be the graphics context that

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:09.091
we're actually going to draw our Bitmaps to. The first think we do here is

00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:12.234
actually called fillRect. Just clear the background of this tile in case we

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:15.948
reuse this thing in the future for anything. The next thing we're going to do is

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:19.653
actually create a rectangle that has top, bottom, left, and right parameters

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:23.210
that represent the tile itself. We'll use this here in a second, to pass to the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.885
is visible function. The next thing we do is actually create a vRect object with

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:30.413
a top left bottom and right value that represents the boundaries of the tile

00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:34.174
world space. We then walk through each tile for our map, and much like before,

00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:37.986
determine whether or not it's visible. Only this time we determine whether or

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:41.710
not it's visible to the passed in canvas rather than the entire viewer. To do

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.422
this, we utilize the same intersect rect function passing into vRect that we

00:00:45.422 --> 00:00:49.431
created before. And creating a new rectangle that represents the tile that we're

00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:53.558
looking at. If the tile is not visible we then, of course, continue on. If it is

00:00:53.558 --> 00:00:57.247
visible, we continue with our same process. Modify world x and world y,

00:00:57.247 --> 00:01:01.128
offsetting it by our new rectangle values. And then, we call our draw image

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:05.316
function. Now, notice that the draw image actually hasn't changed. In fact, most

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:09.483
of this code is actually identical to your original draw function. Except that

00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:13.515
we're now testing tiles against vRect, given from our canvas tile, as well as

00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:15.134
drawing to the vRect context.
