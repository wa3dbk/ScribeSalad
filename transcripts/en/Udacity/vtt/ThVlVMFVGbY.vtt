00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Once again, Big Theta allows us to work with functions in a much simpler form

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
without losing their essence. Let's just make sure that we understand how to do that.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's take this expression 2n² + 6n + 20 log n.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Which of these is it Big Theta of?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Is it Θ of itself? Is it Θ of the term with the largest coefficient?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Is it Θ of the highest order term--n²--but with the largest coefficient--20.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Is it Θ of n² by itsef?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It is Θ of a combination of these things--n² and log n together?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
More than one of these is true. Check exactly the ones that are true.
