00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.550
For this program assignment, you need to create the variable year_joined,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.530
and assign it to the data frame pf. To do that,

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.710
we just need to take our reference year 2014, and subtract

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.370
off our tenure, or the number of days someone's been active

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.120
on Facebook. Now, tenure is measured in days rather than in

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.710
years, so we need to divide this 365. I also need

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.270
to make sure that I actually access the variable so I

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.290
need to include pf right here with a dollar sign. Now,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.320
this number will give me a year with a little

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.200
bit of extra if there's a decimal. Now, I don't really

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.380
care about the decimal, since that doesn't make a full

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.440
year, so I just want to floor this number. The function

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.920
floor will return the greatest integer that's not larger than

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.580
this number. When I run the code, it doesn't look like

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.130
much happened. But if I check my data frame, I

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.929
can see that I have another variable. There it is, year_joined.
