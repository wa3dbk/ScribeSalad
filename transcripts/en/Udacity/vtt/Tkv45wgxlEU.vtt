00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.930
In this lesson, we're going to learn
about the NumPy numerical library.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.340
NumPy is a Python library that acts
as a wrapper around underlying C and

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.900
Fortran code.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.880
Because of that, it's very, very fast.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.450
NumPy focuses on matrices which
are called in the arrays.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.540
The syntax is very similar to MATLAB, so

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.305
if you've used MATLAB before
It'll look familiar to you.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:28.850
NumPy is one of the important
reasons people use Python for

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.900
financial research.
