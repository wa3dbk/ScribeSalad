00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.430
I want to focus more
deeply on selectors.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.090
To do this,
I've created a simple unstyled web page.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.690
This web page showcases my top
three favorite books of all time.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.825
If you couldn't tell,
I'm a big survival and adventure fan.

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:18.985
Let's try to add some
styling to this web page.

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:23.285
I've open the .HTML file,
and using tag selectors,

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:29.940
we could write some CSS that selects all
the h1 tags, H2 tags or paragraph tags.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.020
But what if we wanted to add
style to the book summaries, but

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.490
not the site description at the top?

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.510
Using tag selectors,
we can only select all paragraph tags.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.820
So what do we do?

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.290
Thankfully, we have a few more ways
to select HTML elements with CSS,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.230
besides using tags.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.320
Instead, we can use attributes.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.630
I'm going to change my html file
to demonstrate how this works.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.910
All right.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.710
So now reloaded my new html
file with a few changes.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.870
If we look at the file I've
added this ID attribute

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.730
site description to my first paragraph.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.170
And if we look at the rest of
the paragraphs I have this class

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.370
book summary.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.840
These two attributes
are extremely helpful.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.240
First, because attributes help us
describe the content of the page

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.400
inside the HTML markup.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.750
You can now clearly see that
the first paragraph on my webpage

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.600
Is my site description.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.080
Now keep in mind,
IDs should be used sparingly.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.620
That's because an HTML element
can only have one ID and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.670
IDs can only be used once per page.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.630
For example.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.570
If I type another ID, this is not okay.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.800
Because I'm passing two ID's,
site description and

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.400
another ID to the same element.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.580
If I add the ID site description here,
this is also not okay.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.360
Because now I'm using site
description in two places.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.530
If I wanted to add an ID here
I'd need to give it another name

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.220
that has not already been used.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.360
If I change the ID to first
book then that would be okay.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.600
Generally, when you're
styling your page,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.700
you'll be styling collections of
elements, not individual elements.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.030
If you want to add the same
attribute to multiple HTML elements,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.010
use classes instead,
like I've done here for book summaries.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.050
Classes can be added to
multiple HTML elements.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.080
And HTML elements can
have multiple classes.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.760
This makes classes extremely
powerful and flexible.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.380
You will use them constantly
as a web developer, and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.970
most web developers
prefer classes over IDs.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.690
Besides organization, these attributes
can be used as CSS selectors.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.770
If I revisit my question from before,
I wanted to style my book summaries

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.780
differently than my site
description here at the top.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.090
Using the ID and class selectors,
I can easily do that.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.960
For book summaries they
use the class attribute.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.190
In order to select an HTML element with
the class attribute I will type a period

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.580
followed by the name of the class.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.510
For the site description
it uses an id attribute

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.590
in order select an HTML
element with an id attribute.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.140
I will type of pound sign or
hash tag followed by the name of the id.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.510
Okay, good.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.840
Finally, allowed some quick styling
to make sure our selectors work.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.605
Let's change the property color
to blue for our book summary.

00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:21.810
And let's change the property color
to red for our site description.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.710
Okay, now save and refresh and perfect.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.650
We can see that the site description and
the book summaries are different colors.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.690
So our selectors worked.
