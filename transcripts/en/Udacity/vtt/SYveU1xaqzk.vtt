Tolerance is an important concept that leads to two additional terms that are

00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:08.700
key to understanding drug use and abuse. And those are physical and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.135
psychological dependence. So, physical dependence is a different phenomenon

00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:17.528
than tolerance, but they are often associated temporally. A person who is

00:00:17.528 --> 00:00:22.870
physically dependent needs the drug in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.803
Moreover, these withdrawal symptoms can be both physically and psychologically

00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:31.950
painful and challenging. Withdrawal from one particular drug can actually

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.429
result in death. Do you know which?
