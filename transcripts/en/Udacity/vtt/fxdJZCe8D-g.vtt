00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.643
Now the first thing to notice is that all

00:00:02.643 --> 00:00:06.070
of these are read and write accesses. There's nothing special

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.890
about them. This is, this is going to be modifying

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.410
data using loads and stores, and this is storing a

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.900
value into it, and this is reading a value and

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.309
using a value. So all of these are normal read

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.140
write accesses, but there is a difference between. The way

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.990
the program uses this flag variable versus this data structure.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.680
The flag variable is being used as a synchronization

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.850
variable. And that's a, a secret that only this P1

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.810
and P2 know about. That this, even though innocuously

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.820
it looks like a simple Integer variable that is used

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.200
in a program where there is special semantic for

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.000
this particular variable so far as this, this program is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.090
concerned. P1 and P2 know that this is the way

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.080
by which their signalling each other, that something that this

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.360
guy waiting on is available from P1.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.850
Right? And so its a synchronization variable. On

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.540
the other hand, the - The data structure A is a normal data. But, both accessing

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.920
the synchronization variable and normal data is being

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.710
accomplished by simple read write accesses that's available

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.490
in the processor. And that's how we're able

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.630
to get the solution for this particular question.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.940
It's comforting to know that atomic read and

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.416
write operations are good for doing simple co-ordination

00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:27.980
among processes as we illustrate it through this

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.210
question. And in fact, when we look at

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.850
certain implementation of barrier algorithms later on You'll

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.580
find that this is all that is needed

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.410
from the architecture in order to implement some

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.070
of them. But now, how about implementing a synchronization

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.630
primitive like a mutual-exclusion lock? Are atomic reads and writes sufficient

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.360
to implement a synchronization primitive like

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.310
a mutual-exclusion lock? Let's investigate that.
