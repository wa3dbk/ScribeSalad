00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.530
So, we actually have two right answers in this case. One set of answers could

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.364
be, f of x equals x plus 3, and g of x equals 1 over x squared. These two

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:14.144
functions, when composed, will give us, f of g of x equals 1 over x squared

00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:20.200
plus 3, exactly what we're looking for. Our other option is this set, here we

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.869
have f of x equals 1 over x plus 3, and g of x equals x squared. This shows us

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.005
that there are different ways to dissect functions and write them instead as

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.360
compositions of other functions.
