00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.238
Now, the probability is almost certain that we're going to select a subject less

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:10.400
than this number. In fact, according to our relative frequency distribution,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.211
most of our values are going to be centered around the mean. And remember,

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:20.214
that's the case in a normal distribution. In other distributions it might be

00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:24.088
different. Therefore the probability is about .99 or 99%.
