You would want to use the Visitor pattern. If you need to perform several

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.100
different categories of operations on the elements of a complex structure.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.540
And you want to simplify the element code by factoring out these operations. For

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.950
the Visitor to be a value, the data structure would be relatively stable.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.070
You wouldn't want to change it very much because that would,

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.850
that would break the overall structure. However, the operations can change, you

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.160
can add new ones without, without breaking the overall structure of the system.
