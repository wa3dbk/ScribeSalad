00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.310
Before you get started with
this nano degree program,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.650
it's really important for you to
evaluate whether or not you're ready for

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.735
the kinds of things we're
going to talk about.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:09.590
We're try and build as much knowledge
necessary for machine learning into

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.920
the curriculum, but there's some things
you need to know before you get started.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.370
If you aren't familiar
with any of these things,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.590
we invite you to use some of
the resources that we've provided, or

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.710
some of the resources available online
to learn the requisite knowledge to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.070
get started.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.960
Generally speaking, what you really need
to know to get started is some math.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.470
You need to know some basic statistics,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.270
some basic calculus, and
some basic linear algebra.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.250
If you can do these like calculating
a standard deviation by hand,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.590
calculating a derivative, or
calculating a determinate of a matrix,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.920
then you're probably ready
to get started here.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.930
Now, of course, at some point
during the nano degree program you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.860
might come across something
that you're not familiar with.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.960
And in that case, we invite you to
pause, go look up some additional

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.200
information and learn what you
need to know to move forward.
