00:00:00.104 --> 00:00:01.755
Okay, how do we go about doing this?

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:11.560
Well, first we're going to dot this row times this column, so that's 1 x 1 + 0 x 2 + 2 x 3. Okay?

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:20.097
Then we're going to dot this row with this column, so that's 2 x 1 + 1 x 2 + 0 x 3,

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:28.643
and then this row with this vector, 0 x 1 + 1 x 2 + 3 x 3.

00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:30.207
So let's sum these up.

00:00:30.207 --> 00:00:33.044
1 + 6 gives us 7,

00:00:33.044 --> 00:00:35.380
2 + 2 gives us 4,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.185
2 + 9 gives us 11.

00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:40.255
So our answers are 7, 4, 11.
