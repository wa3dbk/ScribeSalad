00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.872
Let's say you've banded together with a group of friends to create a freelance

00:00:02.872 --> 00:00:07.640
photography company. You've taken on the role of manager and your friends are

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.460
the photographers. Customers describe photography assignments to you. And you

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.460
label the assignments with priorities. Each day you have a team meeting, where

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.914
you give out the highest priority assignments to your friends. Each

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:23.920
photographer can do one assignment per day. And every so often, you like to

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.630
review all of the pictures in the company portfolio. What are some of the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.308
methods that might be carried out by objects of those classes? This is a very

00:00:32.308 --> 00:00:35.748
open ended question. What you come up with will depend on how you imagine this

00:00:35.748 --> 00:00:39.932
situation. There are a lot of correct answers here. I haven't specified every

00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:44.021
single step of the program. So everything's open to interpretation. What nouns

00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:48.155
do you want to make classes out of? And what are the methods that might go with

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:51.810
those nouns? I won't give an automatic grade but will be collecting the answers

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.060
and analyzing them.
