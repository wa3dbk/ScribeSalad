So as a reminder, we are specifically concerned about whether or not sleep

00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:09.610
influences memory. But we've identified all these other variables that could

00:00:09.622 --> 00:00:14.540
influence memory. Now it's time for a quiz. So, would you trust this data more

00:00:14.622 --> 00:00:19.445
If you knew that everyone had taken this test at the same time of day, meaning

00:00:19.457 --> 00:00:24.160
the same time of day for everyone's respective time zones. So, for example,

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:29.205
someone in India took it at 5 o'clock their time, same as someone in California

00:00:29.217 --> 00:00:32.025
who took it at 5 o'clock their time. Yes or no?
