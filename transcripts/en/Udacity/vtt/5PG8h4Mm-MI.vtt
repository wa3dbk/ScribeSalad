00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's turn the tables a bit and attack the problem from the other direction.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This time, I'd like you to use the interpreter, and you're going to create

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
your own regular expression.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Assign to the variable regexp, a common abbreviation for regular expression,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a regular expression that matches either the exact string ab--2 letters in ab--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or 1 or more digits. To help clarify this specification, I have 3 positive instances--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you should match ab, 1, and 123--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.063
and 3 negative instances--don't match a alone, don't match abc, and don't match abc 123.
