00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.437
let's continue implementing the addChoice method. You've already done the first

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:08.032
part, adding a new choice to the list of choices, now if this parameter here

00:00:08.032 --> 00:00:11.513
says that it was the correct choice then we should set the answer, and the

00:00:11.513 --> 00:00:15.167
answer should be a string 1, 2, 3 or 4 depending on whether this was the first,

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:22.482
second, third or fourth choice. How do you know which choice it was? It's not

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:25.898
passed as a parameter to add choice, but you can tell by looking at how many

00:00:25.898 --> 00:00:30.914
elements are already in the choices array. Of course, when you ask the choices

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:34.610
array for it's size, that's an integer, answers are strings, just concatenate

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.834
with the empty string to change the integer to a string. And now you're

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:43.575
going to have a bit of a challenge. When you have a choice question object, it

00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:48.127
has two instance variables. The correct answer, this instance variable is

00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:52.974
inherited from the question super class and the list of choices. You will want

00:00:52.974 --> 00:00:56.160
to set the answer to a string, such as this string 3, but how can you get at

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.982
it? The answer is an instance variable of the question class and it's private,

00:01:00.982 --> 00:01:04.622
no one can access anything private in the question class accept the methods of

00:01:04.622 --> 00:01:10.020
the question class themselves. Choice question extends question but that

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.537
doesn't give it any special privileges. It cannot access this instance field

00:01:14.537 --> 00:01:18.063
any more than anyone else. So that's the challenge you need to overcome. And

00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:21.327
the point is, of course, that just like everyone else, you will need to use the

00:01:21.327 --> 00:01:27.163
public interface off the question class. Go ahead, give it a try, and implement

00:01:27.163 --> 00:01:29.991
the add choice method.
