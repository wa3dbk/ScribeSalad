00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.890
The next model we're going to discuss, is the Yerkes-Dodson Law. So the

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.974
Yerke-Dodson Law states that moderate levels of arousal, lead to optimal

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:13.110
performance. So think back to our lesson on consciousness, where we talked

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.490
about our levels of awareness. At one side of the continuum, we were

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.422
unconscious, so in a coma, and we had zero awareness. And at the other end of

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:26.454
the continuum. We are fully awake and aware. So, the idea here is somewhat

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:31.151
similar. Except, instead of having awareness on a continuum, we have our level

00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:36.447
of arousal on a continuum. Like you see here, we go from low levels of arousal

00:00:36.447 --> 00:00:41.080
to high levels of arousal. And we also have quality of performance from low to

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.836
high. So the idea here, is that we prefer to be in situations that are neither

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:50.469
over-stimulating or under-stimulating. For example, over here when you're

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.260
highly aroused, you'd be panicked. And you probably wouldn't perform very well.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.612
And around here you'd probably have a lot of anxiety and again, your

00:00:57.612 --> 00:01:01.600
performance wouldn't be that great. And a little higher up, we'd see stress

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.620
where often the level of performance would still be decreasing when we're under

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.520
stress, but we are highly aroused. Here we'd be mildly aware. You're awake, but

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.381
not really into whatever we're doing. A little farther down, we'd see boredom

00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:20.400
and finally towards the bottom is where we'd find sleep. So we really want to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.384
be in this central area, for the optimal level of performance. We see these as

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:28.910
important not only for things like academics. This could even be like for

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.193
playing sports. So say you're playing hockey or soccer. You don't want to have

00:01:32.193 --> 00:01:35.231
too high of a level of arousal because then you're going to be panicked to have

00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:40.208
a lot of anxiety. Which will decrease your performance. But, you also don't

00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:44.890
want to be really bored or kind of tired and not really there. You want to be

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.120
in this middle zone. That way, you can perform your very best.
