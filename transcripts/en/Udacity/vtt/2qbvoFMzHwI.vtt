And the answer is $50. We're looking for the peak of this parabola, which is at

00:00:05.302 --> 00:00:10.464
this point right here. We trace this down, the spot it corresponds to on the

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:15.859
horizontal axis, you see it's directly between 40 and 60, so it should be 50, or

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:16.219
$50.
