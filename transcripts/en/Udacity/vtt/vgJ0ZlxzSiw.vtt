00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.560
In order to mine this site for the data we

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.370
need, we need to look at how we programmatically construct requests

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.630
in order to pull each page of data that we're

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.920
going to need. Remember each time through, we're going to be

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.430
passing a carrier value and an airport value. So the

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.960
best way, I think, to do this is to use the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.670
browser to tell us how it makes requests to the site.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.290
Because the browser is obviously

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.290
successfully making those requests and receiving

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.880
the results. Now to do that, We can take a

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.770
look at the network tab. Now I've just opened this so

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.140
at this point there are no network requests captured. In

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.600
order to get those what we're going to need to do

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.254
is submit our request again. Now its possible when you

00:00:42.254 --> 00:00:44.686
do that if you've had the page open for a while

00:00:44.686 --> 00:00:48.014
that you'll actually get an error page instead if that's the

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.318
case just copy this into a new tab and look it

00:00:50.318 --> 00:00:53.480
as if you're loading it for the first time.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.790
Simply trying to reload the page won't work for

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.040
you. Alright, so let's scroll to the top here.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.880
And we can see right here that a post request

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.590
was submitted. If we click on that, that will

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.880
allow us to actually take a look at the HTTP

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.290
that was sent across, the request itself, as it's

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.450
encoded as HTTP, in order to retrieve this page full

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.470
of data. This is the same page we've been

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.118
looking at all along. Now, what I'm interested in is

00:01:22.118 --> 00:01:26.253
exactly what data is submitted for this particular form.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:29.103
So going back to the Network tab, what I want to

00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:31.653
do is scroll down until I find Form Data,

00:01:31.653 --> 00:01:34.503
and right away I realize that we have more work

00:01:34.503 --> 00:01:37.955
to do. Than we might have originally expected. This is

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:40.505
a perfect example of why we want to use the

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:44.071
browser to figure out how to construct our requests. To

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:48.225
this point, we've been operating under the admittedly naive assumption that

00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:50.829
all we were going to need to submit were the carrier

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.371
and airport as the form data in order to fetch each

00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:56.236
page we're interested in. But we can see right here

00:01:56.236 --> 00:01:59.372
that there are at least three more fields that we're going

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:01.868
to need to submit, and it's not clear at all to

00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:05.630
us at this point where this value comes from. So that's

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.940
more work to do for us. But this is exactly

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.500
the type of situation that this particular class is about. In

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.660
some sense, we're essentially bending the web to our will. This

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.050
is where we're really getting into the meat of data wrangling.
