00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's take a look.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Suppose our word rule comes first, just like it does here on the page in some sense.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hello is definitely a word, but actually,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
world in quotes is also a word because this quotation mark

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is not a space, a left angle or a right angle.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If this comes first, we get word, word, which would make us very unhappy.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
On the other hand, if it comes after string,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
then we'll end up getting the behavior that we're expecting.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
However, probably this whitespace rule

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
actually has to come first

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
lest we confuse whitespace and the body of strings.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Our word rule precludes us from including spaces as parts of words,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but our string rule really does not, so we probably want our whitespace rule

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to come if not first, somewhere near the top.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That means that our word rule is the one that comes last.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If our final ordering is either whitespace, string, word,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
string, whitespace, word, we'll get the output we expect.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Let's walk through the first one and see how it goes.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We'll start with the h in hello. Does that match whitespace?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
No, it does not. We'll try our next rule.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Does that match string? No, it doesn't start with a double quote.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Could it match word? Oh, it totally could.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And now we'll use our maximal munch power, and it will eat up the e,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the l, l, o, comma,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but it's going to stop because whitespace has higher priority.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We'll see the word hello,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
then we'll see the space.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Does that match the whitespace rule? It does, so we'll pass over it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Then we'll see these double quotes. Does that match the whitespace rule?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
No. Does it match the string rule?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Yes, it does.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Maximal munch will take us all the way to the end of this token,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and we get the output we expect, and the second case behaves similarly.
