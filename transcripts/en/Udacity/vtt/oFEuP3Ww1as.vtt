00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's my approach to the problem.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's our axes.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here's my function, f(x).

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, the problem is I'm given some value of y,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and I want to find the value of x that corresponds to that such that f(x) equals y.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The strategy we had before was to just start at the 0 point

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and go out step-by-step-by-step, but that's going to be slow if there are lots of steps.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
My approach is going to be--first I'm going to take one step forward,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and then if the value of f(x) is still below y, then I'm going to double how far out I go.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm going to keep on doubling how far out I go and checking--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
1, 2, 4, 8, 16 units out--until I've got bounds.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Here I have this value that I doubled. F(x) was less than the desired y.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
When I went all the way out to here, f(x was greater than the desired y.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I know that the right x has to be somewhere within this range.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That gives me the low and the high that I get by doubling.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now I'm going to find the exact value or close to exact value within low and high by halfing.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
First doubling, now halfing.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I look in here, say what's halfway between low and high. That's at this point.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
F(x) there is still too high.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now I know I must be somewhere in this half.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I go halfway there. That's still too high.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now I know I must be in this half, and I keep on doing that process

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
until I zero in on the right value.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That's the strategy. Now let's see what the code looks like.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Here's my function "inverse."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm going to have my smallest delta--the smallest amount that I move out--be 1/1024.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That's going to get me to within three significant digits.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm going to build up this f inverse function.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I was given y = f(x).

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm going to build up x = f_1(y).

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I do that first by finding the low and high bounds--

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it's got to be somewhere in there--and then doing a binary search

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
somewhere in between that low and high to find a value that's accurate to within delta.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Here's how I find the bounds.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I start off, and I just keep on doubling until I find a value that's high enough.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
What I keep on doing is narrowing down the interval between low and high

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
until they come out to be the same--until the interval has disappeared.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
If I'm too high, then I change the low. Otherwise, I change the high value.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
That makes the interval smaller and smaller.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
If I hit it exactly, I go ahead and return the x value.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
If I haven't hit it exactly, then I know I'm somewhere in between the two,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and I just check out which one to do.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now, I've defined some functions here to help me test what I've done.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I've defined the square and the 10^x functions.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Now I define those inverses.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The logarithm is just the inverse of the power of 10,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and sgrt is the inverse of square using the function I defined.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Can also do a cube root as the inverse of the cube function.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Then I'm defining some tests.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
For these sets of numbers, I'm going to test these functions--sqrt, log10, and cuberoot,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and I'm going to test them against the correct mathematical functions as defined by Python.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
These are the ones I've defined with inverse.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
These are the ones Python defines, and here's my individual test.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Here's what I get when I run the tests.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
For each of the numbers and for each of the functions here is the result I compute

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
with my inverse function.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Here is the actual results, and you can see the differences are all in the 0.001 or less.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
That's true for small numbers, and it's true even as we go up to bigger numbers like 10^8.
