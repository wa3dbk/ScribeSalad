00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For three procedures you were asked to determine whether they terminate

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for all inputs which are natural numbers--1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
When we have a while loop and its condition is True, that's always going to mean

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that the block underneath is performed.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The loop will just keep going and going and going.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It will never fail at the condition.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The only way this will terminate is if something within the block causes it to terminate.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We see we have a break here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now what we have to determine is whether that break is always reached.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Here we have n = n - 1.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
When n is a whole number, it just steps down one step at a time each time it goes through the while loop.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Eventually, it will reach 0.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So this condition here will succeed, and the break will be reached for all natural numbers n.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The procedure will return 3.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
For this one, it does terminate for all inputs n.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
For procedure 2, we can give an example when n = 4.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Let's see what happens.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Is n equal to 0? No, it's not.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We return 1 plus the procedure 4 - 2, which is 2.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Then we look to see if we put 2 in here for n, then, no, n isn't 0.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We return 1 plus the procedure of 2 - 2, which is 0,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and call it again with 0. N is 0 so it returns 0. That works okay.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But what happens if n = 5?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
When we get here, n - 2 = 3, so we call the procedure again with n equals 3.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
N is not 0, so we come to here again.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This time we have n is 3, 3 - 2 is 1.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Call the procedure again with n is 1. N is not 0, and we come to here again.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We call the procedure with n - 2, which is 1 - 2, which is -1.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We've missed 0, and we're never going to get to 0, because we're always decreasing n.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
This procedure will not terminate for some n.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
In fact, it won't terminate for any of the odd numbers.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
For the final procedure--will this terminate?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We put in the value of n, and we call it again.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We can see that we're decreasing n by 1, by 2, and by 3.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
For large n, we don't need to think about it, but what happens when we get near the base case?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Are we going to always be able to terminate or not?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If the input is 6, we're going to get 5, 4, and 3.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The 3 will be okay.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Then on the next round when we have 5, if we input 5, we'd have 4, 3, and 2.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Well, that will be okay, because 2 will be less than or equal to 3.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
If n is 4, then we're going to have 3, 2, and 1. That's okay.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
All of these are small enough.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
When n gets small, we don't have a problem because of the less than or equals,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
which means this is going to terminate for all natural numbers n as well.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The correct answer is that procedure 1 will terminate,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
procedure 2 will not terminate for all n, and procedure 3 will terminate.
