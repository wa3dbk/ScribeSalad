00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.166
Before I write any code, I'm going to figure out all of the dimensions and

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:08.385
specifications of my rectangles. Box will match the specifications given. So,

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:14.305
it'll be at 60, 90 and have a width of 20 and a height of 30. The question asks

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:17.785
for the dimensions of both boxes to be the same. So this one will also be 20

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:22.888
wide and 30 tall. I need to figure out where this upper left corner is. It

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:28.030
looks like it's 20 to the right from 60, so that should be at 80. And it's also

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.695
30 down from 90, so that should 120. Now, I have all of the specifications, and

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:36.755
I need to put them into the constructor calls. So, in the BlueJ project, I'll

00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:42.605
edit the code for rectangle demo. Open editor. And then the main method, I'm

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:48.114
going to create two rectangles: Box and Box Two. And then once I've created

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:52.546
them, I'm going to draw them. We'll make box a new rectangle. Now, this

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:58.226
constructor needs to take an x, a y, a width and a height. X we know is 60, y

00:00:58.226 --> 00:01:05.394
is 90, the width is 20 and the height is 30. Now for box two, x is 80, y is

00:01:05.394 --> 00:01:11.654
120, the width is 20 and the height is 30. So if I stretch this out, it should

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:16.020
look like this. Let's compile, and now I'll run my method. And it drew my

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.090
rectangles, just as I asked for.
