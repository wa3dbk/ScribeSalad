We should use 10 gallons of a punch mix that's 80% water to get a punch mix

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:08.612
that's 75% water. Here's how we can do that. First, we distribute, next we

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:12.948
subtract 3 and 25 hundredths from both sides. This gets my constant on the

00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:17.288
right, which means I want to move my x to the left. Then I subtract this term

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:22.852
from both sides. And finally, I divide by the coefficient in front of x, 5

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:27.058
hundredths. So I get x is equal to 10. 10 gallons.
