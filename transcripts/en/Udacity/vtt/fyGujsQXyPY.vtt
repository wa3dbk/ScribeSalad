One of the neat things about mobile apps is

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.070
they're inherently social. I'm always looking at my phone to

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.170
see who called and texted me, but also for things

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.690
like Facebook posts and to see what popped up in

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.500
my notifications. Salesforce has something like Facebook for the enterprise

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.370
called Chatter. Chatter allows you to follow not only people,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.030
but records. You can form groups of people and work

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.490
on records collaboratively. You can follow bug reports, or you

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.620
could follow cases or really just about anything you want that interests you.
