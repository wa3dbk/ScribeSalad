00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.220
Now let's move on to
the Nil-Coalescing operator,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.980
which is the double question mark.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.290
This is a great operator that's
built on top of the optional type.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.440
What it allows us to do is
safely unwrap an optional and

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.900
if it contains something,
we use the unwrap value.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.740
But if it's nil, then we can
specify a different value to use.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.807
So let's look at this line that
uses the nil-coalescing operator.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.290
This is the way that
you want to read this.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.520
I want to assign the value
of newFavoriteRestaurant

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.880
to the whereToEat constant.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.400
But if newFavoriteRestaurant is nil,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.310
then I want to use
the yummyRestaurant instead.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.630
So right now the newFavoriteRestaurant
is assigned to Chez Fonfon.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.330
So that's what gets
assigned to WhereToEat.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.160
But if we make this nil instead,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.500
then Chez Lulu gets used instead because
newFavoriteRestaurant is now nil so

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.450
it skips and uses the yummyRestaurant
instead and that's pretty slick.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.500
Now below, I have a more complex example
that uses multiple nil coalescing

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.170
operators together.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.140
I encourage you to check it out.
