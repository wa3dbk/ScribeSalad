00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.500
Since real numbers and imaginary numbers are both subsets of the complex numbers

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.328
then we need to be able to write all the numbers that are in both of those

00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:11.097
subsets in the form a plus b i. Something special happens though for these

00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:12.987
numbers a and b for the real numbers and something special for the imaginary

00:00:12.987 --> 00:00:18.536
numbers. For all the real numbers what needs to be set equal to zero in this

00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:24.355
form, and for all imaginary numbers what needs to be set equal to zero?
