00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.780
To the client, the value of the composite pattern is that it can

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.600
treat all elements if the data one way using the component abstract class.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.730
That is where the component can contain other components, which is called

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.580
a composite, or it's treating components that don't have other components, which

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.740
are called leaves. Need not be dealt with as far as the client is concerned. For

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.980
example, a graphic may be a line or rectangle. Which are Leaves, or

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.920
it might be a picture containing other graphics which would be a Composite.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.450
Note that in the diagram Leaf and Composite are subclasses of Component.
