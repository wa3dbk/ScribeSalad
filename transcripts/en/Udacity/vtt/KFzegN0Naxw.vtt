00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
So what does this mean for the problem sizes that we can expect to handle?

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.740
I'm going to give you a little quiz here so that you can develop a feeling for that.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.720
Assume that we want to consider, at most, 1 billion possible solutions

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.210
for an NP complete problem, 1 billion different assignments of 0 and 1 to the vertices.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.810
So what I would like you to do is to figure out the maximum problem size that we can handle

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.270
using these best known search trees under this condition here.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.640
We want to consider, at most, 1 billion different solutions.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.720
So please enter your answer here in these boxes.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.150
What I would like you to do for this box here is use this algorithm.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.000
For this box here I would like you to use this one here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.290
And for comparison I would like you to figure out 2 more.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.410
One is 1.1 to the power of N, and one is 2 to the power of N.

00:00:45.410 --> 99:59:59.000
So there's actually 5 different answers here.
