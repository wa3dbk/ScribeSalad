00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.855
We have one more pattern to cover with bases and exponents and this involves

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:07.824
division. I can think about expanding 3 to the 4th and 3 squared, just like

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:12.000
before. We can simplify common factors in the numerator and denominator. They

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.244
make 1. Because we're working with a fraction made up of factors, we know these

00:00:16.244 --> 00:00:20.816
make 1. So we're left with 3 times 3, or 3 squared. We can think about expanding

00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:25.617
these variables as well. We simplify common factors in the numerator and in the

00:00:25.617 --> 00:00:30.099
denominator, and we're left with f to the 3rd. This last one is just like the

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.655
others before except we needed to do something additional for the two numbers or

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:39.242
coefficients. I know 6 divides into 12 and 6 divides into 18. 6 into 12 is 2,

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:43.587
and 6 into 18 is 3. So I have 2 3rds times w to the 5th. I've showed you the

00:00:43.587 --> 00:00:47.656
expanded form, and the simplification, so that way we could look at the pattern.

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:51.777
What's happening as we move from the left side to the right side? What do you

00:00:51.777 --> 00:00:56.041
notice about the exponents? Let's see if you can answer this with a question.

00:00:56.041 --> 00:01:00.562
What's a rule for the pattern that you see over here? You can write your answer

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:04.590
in this box. And be sure that it includes a base of x, and involves your

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.073
exponents a and b. What'd you do with them?
