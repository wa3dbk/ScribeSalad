00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.416
Now there are really 2 components to the analyze stage--

00:00:02.416 --> 00:00:06.081
understanding where your application spends its time

00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:09.715
and understanding what you want to do with the additional parallelism.

00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:12.534
So understanding hotspots is pretty straightforward.

00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:15.299
Often the programmer will have some intuition for this.

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.897
They'll have some idea where the time is being spent in their code.

00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:21.669
But intuition can be wrong and there's no substitute for data, so don't rely on intuition.

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.593
So run your favorite profiler, whether that's GProf or VTune

00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:28.278
or the brilliantly named Very Sleepy profiler,

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:32.412
and look at how much time the various functions or lines of code take.

00:00:32.412 --> 00:00:36.379
You're going to get some output back that tells you how much time each function takes.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.250
So this function might take 10% of the time,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.604
this function might take 20% of the total time of the program,

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:46.590
and in this case, the program is spending 50% of its time in this 1 function,

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.190
so there's a clear hotspot here.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.924
Maybe your intuition would have told you that this is where the time is going.

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:53.837
Often you do know that first hotspot,

00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:56.419
but sometimes you're surprised surprised by that second and third hotspot.

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:57.983
Sometimes they're not what you think.

00:00:57.983 --> 00:01:00.705
And this gives you a starting point of where to begin parallelizing the code

00:01:00.705 --> 00:01:03.998
and an indication as well of how much speedup you can expect to do so.

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:05.576
Let's try that at home with a quiz.

00:01:05.576 --> 00:01:08.522
So in this example that we've shown here, the question is

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:14.226
what is the maximum speedup possible that you could hope for if you parallelized this top function,

00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:16.158
the function which takes the most time?

00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:17.725
Okay, that's this one.

00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:22.296
And then I'll say what if you parallelized the top 3 functions? So what if you parallelized all of these?
