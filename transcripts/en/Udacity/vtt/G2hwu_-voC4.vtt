Let's say k was equal to negative 5. Well, I would have the absolute value of

00:00:04.157 --> 00:00:08.538
negative 5 is greater than negative 3. So, 5 is greater than negative 3, that's

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.043
true. What if k was negative 1? I'd have the absolute value of negative 1, which

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:17.225
is greater than negative 3. Well, the distance of negative 1 to zero is just

00:00:17.237 --> 00:00:21.482
positive 1. So, this is true, too. We know any number to the right of zero will

00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:25.324
be positive. And, in fact, the absolute value of any number is always greater

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:29.064
than or equal to zero. So, this is always true, it doesn't matter what k is. Any

00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:32.945
real number would work on our number line. That was a tough question and I hope

00:00:32.957 --> 00:00:36.934
it got you thinking. Now that we've wrapped up this lesson, try practicing a few

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:40.711
problems, and feel free to look back if you need to. Sometimes these concepts

00:00:40.723 --> 00:00:41.650
can be challenging.
