00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The next mode of operation I want to talk about is called CTR mode,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which stands for "Counter." We have a message divided into blocks,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
just as before. We'll have our encryption function, just as before,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we can think of it as AES or any other block cipher.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And that takes a key as input--we'll use the same key--but instead of just

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
having a message block go in, what we're going to do instead is have a counter:

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
some value that cycles through the natural numbers.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's going to be our input message, so we'll get, out of that, some cipher text.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And what we're going to do now--well, so far none of this has anything to do

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
with the message. Right--we've just encrypted the counting values

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
from Zero to n - 1.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What we're going to do is EXOR those--EXOR the outputs, here--

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
with the message, so the message box goes into these EXORs

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and what comes out is the cipher text box.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If we did it just like this, we wouldn't have quite as much security as we would like.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We'd be vulnerable to attacks that search the space of counters.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We'd also be vulnerable because we're using the same sequence of counters

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
for every file that we encrypt with the same key.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So the solution to this is similar to what we did with the initialization vectors

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
in the previous mode. What we're going to do is add a nonce.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We'll append the nonce with the countervalue.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And a nonce is very similar to a key. A nonce is a one-time, unpredictable value.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Unlike a key, it doesn't need to be kept secret.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The point of the nonce is to make sure every time we use

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
counter mode with the same key we get different blocks out.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So as an example with AES, if we have 128 bits as the block size,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
we might have a 64-bit nonce and a 64-bit counter.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So let me summarize these two modes. So we saw Cipher Block Chaining mode,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and we saw Counter mode, and CBC mode--the "i"th block of the ciphertext,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
is a result of encrypting using the key.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The "i"th block of the message with the previous ciphertext block--

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and we need a slightly special case for zero,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
which would use, instead of the -1 ciphertext block,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
which doesn't exist, would use an initialization vector.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
With Counter mode, the "i"th ciphertext block is the result of encrypting

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the value of "i"--that's our counter--

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
with some nonce, and I'm writing this as concatenation--

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
so we have 64 bits here pasted next to those 64 bits

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
for the counter and the nonce,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and that is EXOR'd with the corresponding message block.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
To do decryption with Counter mode, well the "i"th message block

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is the "i"th ciphertext block, EXOR'd with this same value,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which, as we know the key,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
we can decrypt. So that's how decryption is done.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
With CBC mode, the "i"th message block is a result of decrypting the "i"th

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
ciphertext block and EXORing that with the previous ciphertext block.

00:03:06.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Or in the case of the very first block, EXORing that with the IV.
