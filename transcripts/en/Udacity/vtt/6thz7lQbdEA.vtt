00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Congratulations. We should be happy we've made it all the way through.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now let's try to summarize what it is that we've covered in this unit.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
To a large extent, this unit was about tools--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
how to build useful tools, how to recognize what they are and put them together,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and how to apply them to components of a domain.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In particular, one of the important tools we looked at is language--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
being able to define the language that you want to deal with

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
rather than the language that Python happens to give you.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We talked about grammars that describe a language,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
interpreters that interpret them, and compilers that do the same thing only faster.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The other main lesson in this unit was functions.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Functions, too, are a very powerful tool

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
They're powerful in a way that statements are not.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
With statements, although in the end we need our statements to write our programs,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
they have this flaw in that they're not as composable as functions are.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If you want to reuse a statement somewhere else, the only you have to do is copy and paste.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That's an issue. That can be a problem.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
because then you've copy multiple copies and you update one but you don't update the other.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
With functions you compose them rather than copy and paste them,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and so that means there's one function that's an object,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and that gets reused automatically.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
When you change it, it gets changed everywhere, because there's one object,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
not multiple copies with copy and paste.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That's the advantages of functions.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We talked about decorators as functions.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We showed how to use functions as objects,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and we showed some patterns for how they fit together

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and allow us to define tools.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I hope you found this all useful,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and I think you'll see in the homework assignments that we have for this unit

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that the difficulty has been stepped up a bit, but you should be able to handle them

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
with the tools that we've covered.
