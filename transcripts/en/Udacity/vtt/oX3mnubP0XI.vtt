00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.577
We need to divide both sides by 2x plus 8. Right now, this factor is multiplied

00:00:04.577 --> 00:00:08.662
in on the right hand side. So, we need to divide by it to get rid of it.

00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:11.238
However, we know that we need to do the same thing to both sides of our

00:00:11.238 --> 00:00:15.338
equation to keep a statement of equivalence. Once we do that, A will be all

00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:18.893
alone on the right hand side. Now we are going to leave this problem for this

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:21.993
moment and you will get to solve it yourself in the practice problems
