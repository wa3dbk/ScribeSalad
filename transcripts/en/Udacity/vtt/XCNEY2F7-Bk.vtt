00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.228
Let's update
the testInsertReadDb test

00:00:03.228 --> 00:00:06.066
to use the WeatherProvider
to get the weather query.

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:09.900
We'll start by changing the name
to testInsertReadProvider.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.530
So, all we need to do
is take this db query

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.590
and replace it with
the equivalent content provider one,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.230
which gets the ContentResolver,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.320
and then queries the CONTENT_URI.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.670
Now, the ContentProvider one
doesn't take a few of these parameters.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.360
For example, it doesn't take TABLE_NAME,
because that's implied by the URI,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.640
nor does it support group by.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.546
The rest of it should work pretty well.

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:36.211
Now let's run the test
and verify that it passes.

00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:39.598
(silence)

00:00:39.598 --> 00:00:41.005
And the test still passes.

00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:45.032
(laughing) Again, it's very easy
to substitute out something

00:00:45.032 --> 00:00:47.750
that calls directly to the database
with a content provider.
