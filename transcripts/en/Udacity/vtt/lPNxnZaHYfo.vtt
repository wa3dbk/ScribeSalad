00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.860
Now that you've got your
analytics account ID,

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.800
the next step is to use
it in a mobile app.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.340
For this lesson we'll use an app that
helps you decide what's for dinner.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.160
In my family, we often have a hard
time deciding what to eat for dinner.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.390
And sometimes it's nice
to just let fate decide.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.070
That's where this handy
dandy app comes in.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.580
The app's very simple.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.230
You select your food preference,
and the app picks a dinner for you.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.910
The app has activities for
the user to view the recipe, or

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.100
order a meal online, or
try for another suggestion.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.300
Users can even hit a button
to say they don't like it.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.900
For example, I don't like
anything that has beets in it.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.360
Just a personal thing.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.860
As you work through the Analytics and
Tag Manager lessons,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.640
you'll add code to use those services.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.270
The functionality of the sample app is
deliberately limited, so that you can

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.790
focus on the parts of the code that
use Google Analytics and Tag Manager.
