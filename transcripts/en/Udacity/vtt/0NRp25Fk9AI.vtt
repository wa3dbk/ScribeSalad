People can be different chronotypes, meaning they function best at different

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.300
times of the day. Have you heard the term night owl or morning person? Well,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.678
these are different chronotypes. A night owl or an evening person is more

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:15.864
likely to rise later in the day and is more alert later in the day into the

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:21.351
evening. Whereas a morning person tends to wake up early. They're most

00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:25.367
efficient in the morning and alert during the day. What chronotype are you? Are

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.500
you a morning person or an evening person?
