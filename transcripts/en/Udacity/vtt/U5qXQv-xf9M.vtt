00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.680
Many misused detection
approaches are signature based.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.890
A signature is essentially a known
pattern of malicious activity data.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.450
For example, this can be option
settings of flags in a packet header,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.280
or it can be a particular
string in the packet pay load.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.250
The set of signatures needs
to be as large as possible

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.695
in order to have a high detection
rate and a low false-positive rate.

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:31.870
Signature-based approaches are most
widely used in anti-virus software and

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.670
network intrusion detection systems.
