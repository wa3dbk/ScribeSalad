00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.020
Okay Michael. So, let's, let's write down a few equations.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.290
Let's try to be a little bit more formal. A

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.340
little bit more mathematical about this idea. So, I'm going to

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.420
try to encapsulate, what we just talked about, to the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.320
line of least commitment. By drawing another line. So, if

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.270
we think, of this top gray line, here. As sort

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.090
of the line, that gets as close to the plus

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.800
points as possible, without crossing over, to them, and mis-classifying them.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.390
And we think of the bottom gray line, as

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.400
the one that gets as close as possible, to

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.180
the minus signs, without crossing over them and, and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.650
giving mis-classification. And then the middle line, is sort

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.020
of in the happy medium. Okay? So, what you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.450
really want from the lines, all the lines that

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.170
are possible, between ,these two boundary lines. If I

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.990
can use that language. Is that, somehow, this distance

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.340
here, is as big as possible. Can you see that?

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, though it seems like the gray line, could

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.170
be pushed out a little more, right? because ,the minuses

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.270
don't bump into it. That's a good point Michael and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.129
I'm going to fix that, by putting a minus sign here.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.047
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:06.047 --> 00:01:07.780
&gt;&gt; Okay [CROSSTALK]

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.839
&gt;&gt; I see, this is [CROSSTALK]

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:10.660
&gt;&gt; I did the best I could under the circumstances.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.170
&gt;&gt; Data, revisionist history.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.400
&gt;&gt; No, there's just an invisible point, and I just made it more visible.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.110
For the sake of the reader. Okay, so, I've got these two

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.590
lines, these are sort of as far as I can go, without stating

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.290
to do mis-classification with my, my separating line, and the line in

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.260
the middle, we've already argued is the sort of the best one because

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.670
it provides the least commitment. So, that means, you want to have

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.570
a line, such that, it leaves as much space as possible, from the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.590
boundaries. Alright, Michael. So let's see if we can figure out exactly,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.510
what that line is like. So, the first thing, that I want to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.370
do is, is introduce a little bit of notation.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.580
Right? So we all remember what the equation, of

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.230
a line is. It's Y equals MX plus B,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.230
that's just a general equation for a line. But,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.640
here even though we're going to be drawing with lines,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.590
we really want to deal with the general case,

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.750
where we're talking about hyperplanes. And generally ,when we

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.085
write about hyperplanes, we describe them as some output,

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:08.607
let's just call it y is equal to

00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:12.890
w transpose plus b. here, because of what we're,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.200
what we're trying to do with classification, the output

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.090
y is going to be some value that indicates,

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.770
whether, you're in the positive class or you're in

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.970
the negative class. W are the parameters ,or W,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.520
represents the parameters for our plane. Along with b,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.890
which is what moves it out of the origin.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.120
Okay, are you with me.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.975
&gt;&gt; I think so, but that's, so may be we should get rid of that top

00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:37.350
,Y, because, that Y is different kind of

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.790
Y. Alright so the top Y is talking about

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.780
the Y dimension of the plane and in

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.360
the second equation, that Y is kind of folded

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.040
into the X. And we have a new

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.990
y, which is actually, the output of the classifier.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.730
&gt;&gt; Right. I like it, so let's get rid

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.400
of that first y which is just an equation

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.340
for a line and let's ask what each of

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.120
these things are. So, let's just say that again

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.000
for clarity's sake. I think, you make a good point, Michael.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.200
Y here, is going to be our classification label ,right, whenever we're

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.420
talking about using a linear separator, effectively, what we've been talking

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.470
about, which I realize now we never ever actually said explicitly, is

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.140
that you are taking some new point, projecting it onto the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.770
line, and then looking at the value that comes out from projecting

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.660
it. And in this case, in particular, we want positive values

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.150
to mean yes, you are part of the class, and negative values

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.395
to mean that you aren't a part of the class. Okay?

00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:24.375
&gt;&gt; Yeap.

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:27.680
&gt;&gt; This is our classification label y.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.430
W represents again, the parameters of the plane.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.680
Along with b, which is what moves it in and out of the origin. So, this is

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.100
now, effectively, what our linear classifiers actually look

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.966
like. Even in multiple dimensions, with hyperpoints. Okay? Cool.

00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:52.560
So, let's take that, and and, and push it, to, to sort of the next level. Let,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.270
let's figure out exactly, what we would expect the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.690
output, of our hyperplane ,to be in this example,

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.390
that I, I've drawn on the screen here. So,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.640
we know we want to find this orange line in

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.930
the middle ,which has the property, that, it is your

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.270
decision value, it tells you whether you are in the

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.010
positive class or negative class, on the one hand,

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.990
but also, that it has the property of being, as

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.140
far away, from the data as possible, while still being

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.510
consistent with it. So, if you're on the decision boundary,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.300
for this particular line, which again,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.355
is w transpose x plus b. What would be, the output

00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:39.229
,of this classifier for any point that lies along the line?

00:04:41.242 --> 00:04:46.440
&gt;&gt; so, right. If that's decision boundary, that's where it's kind of

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.310
not sure ,if it's positive or negative so that should be zero.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.510
&gt;&gt; Right, so the equation of this line or this hyperplane, is w transpose x

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.610
plus b equals zero. For, some set of parameters w and b, we don't

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.710
yet know what they are. But, what we do know, that this is the definition

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.410
of a hyperplane. Where the equation for

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.610
a hyperplane, and since it's at the decision

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.780
boundary ,it should give me neither a positive or a negative output. Okay?

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.740
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.710
&gt;&gt; Okay now, one question we can ask

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.500
ourselves then, if we look at these other

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.200
lines is well what's the equation for the

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.160
other grid lines? That are right at our positive

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.220
or negative examples. So to help you answer, that, I want to talk about what the

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.610
labels themselves ought to be. So ,just like

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.150
we did with boosting, let's say that our labels

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.090
are always going to be, from the set minus

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.836
one and plus one. We know ,that our labels

00:05:38.836 --> 00:05:41.310
,are minus 1 and plus 1. And so we're

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.470
going to take advantage of that fact, by saying well.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.710
The line that brushes up, against ,the positive example.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.680
We want it to be the case ,since, we

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.106
know those labels are going to be plus 1.

00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:57.330
That, the output ,of that particular line, that particular linear

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.980
separator, would be plus 1, on the very

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.390
first point, that it encounters. Does that make sense?

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.580
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.250
&gt;&gt; That way the things, that are, that it's you

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.330
know that are kind of past the line are going to be above

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.470
1 and the things are before the line, in that

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.614
kind of demilitarized zone, are going to be between zero and 1.

00:06:13.614 --> 00:06:15.250
&gt;&gt; Right, so in fact given what you

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.580
just said, what is the equation of that line?

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.610
&gt;&gt; Oh I see. So, it should, be the W transpose x plus b equals,

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.340
1 for the top gray line.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.970
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. And by a similar argument,

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.140
where would you say the, the line of the

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.570
hyperplane should be for the bottom gray line? Analogously,

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.130
it seems like that one should be minus one.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.720
&gt;&gt; Right. So, we, we have the decision boundary,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.290
we're looking at, and we know that the equation of

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.380
the line is w transposed x plus b is zero.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.640
We know that if we slid that line, towards the

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.470
positive values, we would end up with w transposed

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.460
x plus b equals one. And if we slid it

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.410
towards the negative values, we'd end up with, equals

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.610
minus one, now we can ask ourselves, how this helps

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.320
us. And it helps us in a very a

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.580
simple way. We know that we want the boundary condition

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.090
line, the one that is actually our decision boundary, to

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.080
be as far as possible from both our positive and

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.220
negative examples, so that would mean then, and

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.544
I hope you buy this Michael, that the

00:07:18.544 --> 00:07:22.950
distance ,between the two gray lines, which are

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.160
parallel, to that line, needs to also be maximum.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what we want.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:33.470
&gt;&gt; Right, so we want this vector here, to have, the maximum link that we

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.000
can have. Okay, so, how are we going to

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.880
figure out how long, that particular line is?

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.500
So, here is a simple idea. Well, the

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.590
lines are parallel to one another. We can pick

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.810
points on that line ,to define, that particular distance

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.410
there. So, just because, it's really easy to do

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.500
the math, I'm going to chose a point here

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.250
and a point here. Those points have the property,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.940
that ,if I draw the line between them, you

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.530
get a line ,that is, perpendicular, to the two

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.980
gray lines. Okay?And I don't know what those x values are, but

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.020
I do, I'm just going to call, them x1 and x2. That seem fair?

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.560
&gt;&gt; Hm, I guess that seems as good a name as any.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.600
&gt;&gt; And that is going to define the two points that

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.510
I have, and the distance between them ,is in fact going to

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:26.340
be or the, the vector, that is defined by their difference

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.630
is in fact going to have the length that tells you how far

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.150
apart those two lines are. Which in turn

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.650
because of the way that we've constructed them Tells

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.520
you how far apart your boundary decision line is

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.409
from the data and we ant that to be

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.669
maximal ,because then we made the least commitment to

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:46.120
the data. So, let's write that down as algebra.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.414
The equation for our positive line so to speak

00:08:50.414 --> 00:08:55.760
,is ,therefore w transpose x1 plus b equals 1.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.540
And all I've done there is substitute, some point, I don't have to know what is,

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:04.930
it's going to turn out, that gives me some point on that line, okay? It

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:10.460
gives me, puts me in some particular place, on that line. And similarly, I

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:16.460
can do the same thing, for my negative line. And get w transpose x2,

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:21.250
plus b equals minus 1. Now, we want the distance between,

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.220
these two, hyperplanes or these two lines, in this

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.160
example, to be maximal. And in order to figure

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.510
out what, that means, we need to know exactly,

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.400
what that line is. So, it's, it's the difference between

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.090
the two. So, we can just use our, our

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.370
favorite trick, when we're doing systems of linear equations.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.010
And, just subtract the two lines. We basically have,

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.160
two equations and two unknowns. And, we simply subtract them,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.220
from one another. So, that we can get

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.240
a single equation. That happens to represent, the

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.740
distance, between them. So, if I subtract the

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.830
two from one another, what do I get?

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:55.180
&gt;&gt; Quiz.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.530
&gt;&gt; Oh, I like that, we get a quiz. That is the correct answer. Even

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.260
though it seems like a tightness match,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.829
in fact quiz, is the correct answer [LAUGH]
