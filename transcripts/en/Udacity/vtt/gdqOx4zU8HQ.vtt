00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.100
&gt;&gt; So subscription models,
why do they rock?

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.741
And is there anything that
people should look out for?

00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:07.391
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:00:07.391 --> 00:00:10.154
They rock,
because they offer win-win situation.

00:00:10.154 --> 00:00:13.954
The lifetime value of the user is
much lower in one time charge.

00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:17.810
With subscriptions,
we let users test before they buy and

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.438
their trust enable us to
increase the lifetime value.

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:24.068
As an entrepreneur,
you're facing two options.

00:00:24.068 --> 00:00:28.598
Make, create your own service or
buy a third party service that

00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:32.711
offers the ability to manage
your subscription models.

00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:36.584
Stripe, Braintree, PayPal and
others are offering it for you.

00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:40.240
We recommend to go with the second
option, because the first one will

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.341
create a lot of work that won't
make your product better.

00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:46.560
It's a classic reinventing the wheel
scenario you wish to avoid.
