00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.960
For this quiz I've given you a simple
HTML table on the right there's a media

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.970
query, remember
sometimes the best way to

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.540
deal with a table column on mobile
is just to simply get rid of it.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.290
So along those lines fill in the blanks
in the media query, so that the game

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.190
time class is hidden when viewports
are 499 pixels wide or smaller.
