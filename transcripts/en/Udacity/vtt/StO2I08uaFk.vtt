00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.050
Now remember,
we started off by saying we want

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.530
2D transformations where we
basically have a matrix M

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.020
to give us values of any point
p to give a point p prime.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.900
Let's look at what we would do to
get something simple as translation.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.750
So what we want to do for
translation is of course,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.680
we would have the axis for x and y.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.690
And we want to translate it into
a different location again from this and

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.750
x and y, so this has been translated.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.840
Let's say for a lack of better
words by an amount, tx and ty.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.610
Okay?

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.750
How we represent this in this new
homogenous coordinate system?

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.610
Well, again, this is what we interested
in x, y prime, x prime, y prime, 1.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.670
X, y and of course,
now let's think about what M would be.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.532
By just looking at this, you notice
that we can actually construct it.

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:55.710
Diagonal terms are all 1's, and these,
these two axis could just be tx and ty.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.220
And if you actually do the math,
you'll basically notice

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.393
that what we will come up with
would be is x prime is going

00:01:06.393 --> 00:01:12.030
to be equal to x plus tx and
y prime would be equal to y plus ty.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.560
That gives us what we wanted.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.200
So translation is easily
modelled this way.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.560
What about scale?

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.970
Again, here, the goal is to go from
this image, to a larger image.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.830
In this case, again,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.830
what we did before, the same two by two
we had looked at before, with sx and sy,

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.470
can go into these two values here, and,
of course, the rest of it will work out,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.670
because what will happen is x prime
times sx, x would be the result.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.550
And that's exactly we want.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.620
So this gives me a nice
three by three matrix for

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.930
being able to doing things like scaling.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.330
What about rotation?

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.980
In rotation, basically I want to take an
image and being able to kind of rotate

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.630
it around where basically how I
need to know things like theta.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.340
And here the theta would
be this value here.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.100
All right.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.170
And we know how to do this.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.805
Again, we know when if, somebody
gave me a theta, I can compute using

00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:09.699
this cosine theta minus sine theta,
just in this two by two.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.190
And again, these are 0, 0, 1.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.520
What gives me x prime, y prime.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.930
And we know how to do this too.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.050
The good thing with homogenous
coordinate system is,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.910
these two parameters help us do
things like model translations.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.840
We can also do shear the same way.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.590
Start with an image.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.410
We want to shear it.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.970
Remember, this was when
shear happened like this.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.030
And of course again, we would put
the shears in the off diagonal terms.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.760
All the diagonals would be run.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.450
You can play around with this yourself
in these matrix multiplies and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.500
you'll see it works.
