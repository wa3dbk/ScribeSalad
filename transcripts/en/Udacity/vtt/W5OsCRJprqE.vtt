00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.526
In a couple of the problems before, we distributed the parenthesis on the

00:00:04.526 --> 00:00:09.352
outside to the exponents on the inside of the parenthesis. We can also do this

00:00:09.352 --> 00:00:14.364
with fractions. If we think all the way back to unit 1, we saw 1 3rd times 1 3rd

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:19.185
times 1 3rd. We knew that result was 1 27th. We found this answer by multiplying

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:23.606
1 3rd by itself three times. There was actually another way we could have

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:27.747
thought about this. I know the exponent on this base, 1, is a 1. And the

00:00:27.747 --> 00:00:32.325
exponent on this base of 3 is also a 1. We can distribute this exponent of 3, or

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:37.047
multiply it to each of the exponents on the inside of the parentheses. So we've

00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:41.413
a base of 1 and an exponent of 1 times 3, and a base of 3 with an exponent of 1

00:00:41.413 --> 00:00:47.015
times 3. This is really 1 cubed, and this is really 3 cubed, or 1 divided by 27.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:52.043
If we can get to this step more quickly, then we can get to our answer, 1 cubed

00:00:52.043 --> 00:00:56.983
is 1, and 3 cubed is 27. Here we have a negative sign, and we're going to square

00:00:56.983 --> 00:01:01.931
it, so we know our answer should be positive. So I'm going to have negative 5

00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:07.455
squared and x squared. So all together, we have 25 divided by x squared. This

00:01:07.455 --> 00:01:12.519
last case of variables works just like this first example. We'll have a to the

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:17.510
5th, divided by b to the 5th. We just multiply the exponents on the inside of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.426
the parenthesis by the exponent on the outside. We raised a power to a power.
