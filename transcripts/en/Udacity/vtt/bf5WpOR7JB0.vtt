Let's now work with a different data set. We write 2, 5, 8 for y, which gives us the mean for y.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Before doing any calculations, let's take a guess what r might be.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Is r is going to be 1, r going to be 3, r going to be 2, or is r going to be 0.

00:00:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
