00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.340
Let us see if we can understand
how caches become incoherent.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.520
Suppose that we have a memory location
A that initially contains a zero value.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.750
In this system we have three cores.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.810
Each core has it's own
write-back L1 cache.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.570
And these write-back caches do
not have any coherent support.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.470
This means that this write-back
L1 cache is simply behave

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.720
as if each of these caches was
just alone in a uni-processor.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.790
So they behave correctly for
a uni-processor cache, but

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.660
they do not try to maintain coherence.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.930
And this is what the three cores do.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.870
Core 0 loads from A into a register,
increments the value in the register,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.490
and then stores the register
back into memory location A.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.932
Sometime later, core one does
pretty much the same thing.

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:54.400
It loads A into a register, increments,
and writes the register back to A.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.190
And finally,
core two does the same thing.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.190
Note that these are happening one
after the other, so without cashes,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.820
core zero would be loading zero,
writing a one, read one on core 1,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.970
put a two back in A, and
then here we read two and put a three.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.070
But with the three L1 caches and
no coherent support, the question for

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.470
you is the value that core A is
writing to A here can be, what?

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.870
Can it be 0, can it be 1, can it be 2,
can it be 3, can it be 4 and

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.770
can it be something larger than 4?

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.140
Put a check next to all of the answers
that might be true for this right here.
