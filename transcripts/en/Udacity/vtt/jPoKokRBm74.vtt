00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:02.390
Now we're going to drill
down into the details and

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.580
make many of the notions we've
been talking about more precise.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.215
First, we need to define running time.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:09.710
We'll let M be a Turing machine.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.040
Single tape, multi tape, random access,
the definition works for

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.900
all of them and
we assume that it halts on all inputs.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.770
The running time then is a function
over the natural numbers where F of N is

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.920
the largest number of steps taken by a
machine for an input string length of n.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.200
We can extend this definition to
machines that don't halt as well,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.510
by making their runtime infinite.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.050
We're always considering
the worst case here.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.390
Let's illustrate this
idea with an example.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.170
Consider this single tape machine
that takes in a binary input.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.190
And tests whether
the input contains a 1.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.980
On encountering a 0,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.730
it simply loops back into this q0
state and moves the head to the right.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.400
When it encounters a 1,
it accepts and halts immediately and

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.040
if it encounters the blank symbol,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.485
indicating the end of the input without
ever having encountered a 1, it rejects.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.120
Let's figure out the running time for
a string of length 2.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.260
We need to consider all
possible strings of length 2.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.840
So we'll make a table like this and
count the number of steps.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.040
The largest number of steps is 3.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.880
We had to read the 0,
the 0 and the blank after it.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.587
And so,
that then is the overall running time.

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:31.181
F(2) = 3.
