00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.600
We can see what looks like a almost linear

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.490
relationship between carat weight and price after doing some transformations,

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.420
but surely there are other factors that influence the price

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.350
of a diamond. When I was looking around at diamonds

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.770
I noticed that clarity seemed to factor into price.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.680
Of course, many consumers are looking for a diamond of

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.900
a certain minimum size. So we shouldn't expect clarity to

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.820
be as strong a factor as carat weight. And I

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.010
must admit that even though my grandparents were

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.370
jewelers. I initially had a hard time discerning a

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.740
diamond rated VVS1 from one rated SI2. Surely, most

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.610
people need a jeweler's loop to tell the difference.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.560
According to blue nile, the cut of a diamond

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.620
has a much more consequential impact on that fiery

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.150
quality that jewelers describe when they talk about diamonds.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.440
On clarity, the website states many of these imperfections

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.460
are microscopic and do not affect the diamonds beauty in any discernible way.
