00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.969
So we said one of the biggest problems
with K means is that it was really

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.710
sensitive to, sort of needing to
know how many clusters there were,

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.285
what K was, and also possibly to the
initial conditions, that you gave it.

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:17.666
So the assumption of K means is that
there are essentially these spherical

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.515
clumps within feature space.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:23.695
So if you're thinking of these
as a probability distribution,

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:28.685
it is that there would be a couple of
modes, peaks, in our features space

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:32.685
that, and sort of falling, nearby
those peaks is a sort of fall off, and

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:37.460
that our pixel intensities are
distributed according to a probability

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.780
density function that has these modes.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.760
So if you could find the modes,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.360
you might be able to
segment the image that way.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.580
So, the approach that we
are going to talk about for

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.160
doing that is called the mean
shift algorithm, and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.730
we actually introduced this when
we were talking about tracking.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.250
It's a little bit easier to talk about
that when we do it as a cluster.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.599
So the mean shift algorithm was designed
as a way of finding these modes,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.010
or these local maxima of density,
in some feature spaces.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.400
So here, by the way, this,
this is a beautiful, pastel image of,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.350
these houses, as the input image, and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.800
what we have here on the right is
the plotting of each of these pixels

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.640
in the L u v color space.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.060
You remember L u v color?

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.920
This is why we're doing this
whole conversation after,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.820
we talked about color.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.920
Because if I told you L u v and

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.620
you hadn't heard it and think I was
doing RGB, no it's L u v, right?

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.020
And you can imagine right away,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.950
that looking at a picture like this,
the color, the chroma, is what matters,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.540
and the absolute intensity
might matter less, right?

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.590
Because the, so let's see,
using this yellow here.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.270
So this is a brighter yellow,
and this is a darker yellow,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.380
but I would like to have them both
be in the same color segment.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.640
So L u v makes that easier.
