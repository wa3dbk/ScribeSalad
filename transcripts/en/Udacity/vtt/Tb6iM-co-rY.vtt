00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.630
There are many refactorings in Fowler's book, and what I'm

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.480
showing here is just a partial list. And we're not going to

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.930
have time to go through the complete list of refactorings,

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.830
so what I'm going to do instead, I'm just going to pick a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.870
few of those, but I'm going to explain in more depth,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.600
and for which I'm going to provide some examples. In particular, we're

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.000
going to talk about the collapse

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.630
hierarchy refactoring, the consolidate conditional

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.600
expressions, the decompose conditionals, extract

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.418
method, extract class, and inline class.

00:00:25.418 --> 00:00:29.420
And we're going to see each of those individually in the rest of the lesson.
