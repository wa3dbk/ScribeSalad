Wow Chris, that's another really hard order of operations problem. If you got

00:00:05.132 --> 00:00:10.023
negative 675, you got the answer right. Now, this was a tough problem, and I

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:14.969
even had to use my calculator. Now, let's see how I got negative 675. When I'm

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:19.632
looking at this problem, once again, I want to work from the inner parenthesis

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:24.211
outwards, following my order of operations. So, the first thing I see is an

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:28.300
innermost paretheses of 1 plus 2, so that's the first operation I'm going to

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.269
perform. Again, I want to make sure that I copy down all of the other operations

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:38.124
that I have not yet performed. Now that I've performed the operation in the

00:00:38.136 --> 00:00:43.179
inner most parentheses, I can do the next level of parentheses which are these

00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:48.021
brackets. So, I want to do negative 4 times 3, which is negative 12. From here,

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:52.838
I see that I have another operation in parentheses which is 4 minus 10. So, I

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.968
can evaluate 4 minus 10 which is negative 6. Now that I've performed all the

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.138
operations inside parentheses, I can move on to my exponents or my powers. So, I

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.331
have three exponents. I have negative 6 squared. Remember when the negative is

00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:13.013
inside the parentheses, it's part of the base. So, it's negative 6 times

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:18.766
negative 6 which is 36. 3 squared of course is nine, and negative 12 squared is

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:24.122
144. Now that I've done all my exponents, I can do my multiplication and

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:29.646
division. The only multiplication I have is negative 5 times 144. So, I can

00:01:29.658 --> 00:01:35.388
write 36 plus 9, negative 5 times positive 144, I had to get my calculator out

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.384
for this one, is negative 720. Now that I've done all my multiplication and

00:01:41.396 --> 00:01:47.580
division, I can do my addition and subtraction in order from left to right. So

00:01:47.592 --> 00:01:53.207
first thing I have to do is 36 plus 9, which is 45, minus 720. 45 minus 720

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.167
gives me the negative 675. Great job.
