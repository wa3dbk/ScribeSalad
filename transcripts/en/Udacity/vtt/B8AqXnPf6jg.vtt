00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.980
The correct answer is happiness. That is our dependent variable. Because

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.036
happiness is what we're measuring by using smiles which is how we are

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:15.620
operationalizing our construct happiness. Happiness is our construct. A

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.880
construct is a psychological concept that we can't necessarily see or touch and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.230
it has to be measured indirectly. And that's why we come up with an operational

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.410
definition. We have to find a way to measure happiness. So we operationalize

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.230
happiness with the number of smiles. That just means when someone smiles we

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.540
interpret it as happiness.
