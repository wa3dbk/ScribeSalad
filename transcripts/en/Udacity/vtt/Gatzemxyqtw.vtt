00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.550
This should print 13.86, and you might use this process when splitting up a

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.350
bill for dinner with friends. In case you're not sure how I got 13.86, let's

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.450
just go through this together. There are two items, and we initially set the

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.406
cost to zero. So initially, cost is zero. And now for the first item, which is

00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:32.258
$1, we're going to say that the tax is $1 times 0.08, so 0.08. And the tip is

00:00:32.258 --> 00:00:42.120
$1 times 0.18. And now the cost is going to be updated to be zero. Plus the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.269
item price, plus the tax, plus the tip, which would give us about 1.26. Now,

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.910
we're going to go through for the other item, which is $10. So this time, the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.590
tax will be 0.80. The tip will be 1.80. And the cost will be what it was before

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.800
plus the item price, plus the tax, plus the tip. Which if you add it all up

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.920
should give us 13.86. And if I did my math wrong, maybe that's just proof that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.891
I should be having a computer do this for me.
