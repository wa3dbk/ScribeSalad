00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.440
Is everything okay?

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.190
You seem a little pensive.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.587
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Yeah I'm just thinking.

00:00:07.587 --> 00:00:11.283
You know choosing a back end stack for
an app is a huge decision, and

00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:15.639
I'm definitely convinced that Firebase
is a good option given how easy it is to

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.770
set up, but is it the best option for
the project?

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.810
There are other database
solutions out there.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.230
I know there's no SQL and SQL Solutions.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.160
There's Oracle, there's Parse.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.240
I guess we could even build our own
back end if we really wanted to.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.200
So I'm just kind of wondering why
not any of those other options?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.320
&gt;&gt; First of all Firebase consists of
a database and a collection of services

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.800
which is sometimes referred
to as back end as a service.

00:00:42.538 --> 00:00:45.530
Let's look at a few other
database options, and

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.710
then compare them to Firebase.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.360
Oracle and SQL are both examples
of relational databases.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.430
These databases are often transaction
based with rollback functionality.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.430
They're generally used for

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.270
larger enterprise applications requiring
a large number of read write operations.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.120
They're not good choices for Shopping
List Plus Plus because they don't

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.140
handle real time applications natively.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.130
Parse is similar to Firebase in
that it is a back end as a service.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.480
It is a no SQL implementation and
uses MongoDB as its database.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.280
For Shopping List Plus Plus
it's a better choice, but

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.630
it still requires third party support
to build real time applications.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.620
Firebase is also implemented
as a no SQL solution

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.460
with the database being
one large JSON object.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.381
There are not tables, or collections,
or documents like MangoDB.

00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:35.360
Also Firebase is hosted in the cloud,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.172
which makes it easier to access data
on any client anywhere in the world.

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:42.650
Finally Firebase gives you complete
control for organizing data and

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.970
changing your schema.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.130
This offers amazing flexibility and
is great for prototyping applications.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.390
&gt;&gt; So Lila while it is possible to build
a collaborative mobile applications with

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.840
either Oracle or
Parse it takes additional planning and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.150
requires additional integration
with third party services.

00:01:58.255 --> 00:02:00.830
Firebase implementation is
designed from the ground up for

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.950
real time and collaborative applications
like Shopping List Plus Plus.
