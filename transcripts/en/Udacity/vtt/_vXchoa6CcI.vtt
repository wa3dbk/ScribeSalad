00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.506
Quick question.
How many eigenvectors are there?

00:00:02.506 --> 00:00:05.652
If I had more than D images.

00:00:05.652 --> 00:00:06.523
Okay.

00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:10.285
So D is 10,000, 10,000 dimension,
let's say, or a million.

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:14.866
So if I had, you know, 10,000 images and
I was looking at all those,

00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.726
I could get 10,000 eigenvectors.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:21.465
But clearly the sum of
those outer products.

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:24.541
If I've only got a small number, right?

00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:26.851
The whole idea is that M is
going to be a lot less than D.

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:28.883
So how many of them are there?

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:32.897
Well your intuition might say,
well I've got M independent things,

00:00:32.897 --> 00:00:35.270
so there must be M of them.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.070
But actually your intuition was wrong,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.720
and in fact, a better intuition
would be the following.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.540
Suppose I gave you two points
in three dimensions, okay?

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.180
How many vectors can span those?

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.450
Just one, right?

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.390
Wo, I go between them.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.091
And the reason is, I have to think
about subtracting off the mean.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:58.823
Right?

00:00:58.823 --> 00:01:00.215
And once I subtract off the mean,

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:02.421
actually I only have one
degree of freedom, right?

00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:05.568
Because the origin is going to be
halfway between those two points.

00:01:05.568 --> 00:01:07.286
So once you tell me where
one of the points is,

00:01:07.286 --> 00:01:08.424
I know where the other one is.

00:01:08.424 --> 00:01:10.246
So there's only one degree of freedom.

00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:14.008
So with two points,
there's only one possible eigenvector.

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:15.447
Let's think about it this way.

00:01:15.447 --> 00:01:20.940
If I have three points in space, okay?

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.100
How many vectors does it
take to span those points?

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.740
Well, they lie in a plane, don't they?

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.330
Of course they do.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.961
Three points to find the triangle.

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:30.003
So with three points,
there's only two eigenvectors.

00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:34.800
In general,
there are M minus 1 eigenvectors.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.300
And the reason there's M minus 1 is,
I take my endpoints and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.560
I subtract out the mean.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.351
So that removes a degree of freedom.

00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:43.730
So that's a trick question that I
always give on the final of my course.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.644
So if anybody's taking the final,
now you know the answer.

00:01:46.644 --> 00:01:48.914
Okay, there's M minus 1.
