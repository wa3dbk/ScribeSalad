All-pairs N-body is an N squared algorithm.

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:06.326
Each object must compute its interaction with each other object,

00:00:06.326 --> 00:00:09.385
So each N object has to compute N minus 1 forces.

00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:14.818
N objects times N minus 1 force computations per object yields work proportional to N squared.

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:20.057
Now, there's a way you can approximate N-body computations with high accuracy with superior work efficiency.

00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:21.825
There are tree-based algorithms, for example.

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:25.594
One's called Barnes Hut, that has N log N complexity and a method called

00:00:25.594 --> 00:00:28.770
fast multi-pole that's actually linear order of N complexity.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.734
They basically work by lumping distant bodies together and treating them as a single body during the calculation.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:38.482
These are neat algorithms; fast multi-pole was actually named one of the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century,

00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:40.550
but they're also considerably more complex.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.917
All-pairs, on the other hand, is very simple and often the way that

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:46.455
production N-Body algorithms compute forces among close together objects,

00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:49.883
and with it, we're going to show how to use the memory hierarchy in an efficient way

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.052
to make this computation as fast as possible.
