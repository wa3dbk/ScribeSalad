00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
So you see, even finding formal criteria to tell you if

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.820
software is doing something malicious

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.370
that you don't want it to do,

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.800
that's very difficult, but let's assume you had found those formal criteria.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.240
Now my question for you would be

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.650
What would be the problem with automated classification of a program as malware

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.430
from a theoretical computer science perspective?

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.190
So even if you had formal criteria

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.400
that defined exactly what malware is,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.140
so are the issues here that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.350
automated malware detection is an NP complete problem?

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.680
Is it automated malware detection undecidable?

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.330
Or is it that automated malware detection can never be perfect?

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.900
That means you will always have programs that are not malware

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.050
that will be classified as being bad

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.010
or other programs that are malware

00:00:42.010 --> 99:59:59.000
but will basically slip through the net or slip by this program here.
