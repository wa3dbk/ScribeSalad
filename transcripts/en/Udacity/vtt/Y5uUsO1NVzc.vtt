00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.340
So let's get back to the problem we had with our web server. And that's that we

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.874
don't want to crawl the web every time we start the web application. We want to

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:11.591
crawl the web once, store it in a file, read that file, and then be able to

00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:15.852
start the server without needing to do any crawls. So what we would like to do

00:00:15.852 --> 00:00:20.736
is move the actual crawling out of the server, replace this with something that

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:25.493
just loads a file and turns that file into a web corpus object. So that means we

00:00:25.493 --> 00:00:29.611
need something that creates that file, and we're going to put that in the

00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:33.373
crawler module. So here's how we're going to modify our code. This is the

00:00:33.373 --> 00:00:37.950
crawler.py module, and we're going to add to it. So when we run it from the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.037
command line,when we run it as the main, and this one way to test for that if

00:00:42.037 --> 00:00:46.392
the name this is built in defined by Python is equal to name that means we ran

00:00:46.392 --> 00:00:52.208
this code directly. But what want to do is do the crawl and write the corpus to

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:57.004
file. That'll be a file that we can load in the server to create the Web Corpus

00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:00.744
object. We could do this ourselves. We could add a method to Web Corpus that

00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:04.965
would output the object in a way that could be stored in a file, just using the

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:08.936
file write operations that we've seen. And we could have another method that

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:12.873
would read it. This would be quite a bit of work. We'd have to walk the entire

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:16.796
structure to store it. There's actually an easier way to do that, that's built

00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:21.073
into Python. And the way to do it is called pickling. This is one of my favorite

00:01:21.073 --> 00:01:25.646
modules built into python. What the pickle module allows us to do, is take any

00:01:25.646 --> 00:01:29.808
object, actually almost any object. We won't get into the ones that it doesn't

00:01:29.808 --> 00:01:34.185
work on. Pickle it, and we can do that by using pickle.dump. That takes in an

00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:40.512
object in the file. This'll store the object in a file. We can store that on

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:45.506
disk, we could mail that around, we could do anything we want with it. Then when

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:50.114
we want to get the object back, we can do pickle.load, passing in the file, and

00:01:50.114 --> 00:01:55.904
magically we'll get back essentially the same object that we started with. If

00:01:55.904 --> 00:01:59.666
this file was created by someone you don't trust, well, they could create a file

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:03.314
so that when you unpickle it, you get an object back that does things you don't

00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:08.560
like. It could potentially run any arbitrary code, so only use this with files

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.290
you trust. In this case, we're going to create the file ourselves, and hope that

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.494
no one else modifies it, and use it in our search engine. So we're going to do

00:02:15.494 --> 00:02:19.627
this in two quizzes. The first where you'll dump the file and the second where

00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:20.643
you did the load.
