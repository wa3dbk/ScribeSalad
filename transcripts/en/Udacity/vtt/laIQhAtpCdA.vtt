00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.142
So factoring by grouping definitely works for certain higher degree polynomials,

00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:08.198
just like it works for certain quadratic polynomials. This time, I'd like you to

00:00:08.198 --> 00:00:12.275
try factoring by grouping for this cubic expression, all on your own. Just move

00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:16.361
through this slowly and carefully, you can definitely do it, and write you final

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:17.355
answer in this box.
