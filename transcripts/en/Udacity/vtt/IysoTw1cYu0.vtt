00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.280
So next time,

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.580
we're going to to do a we're not going
to give up generative models yet.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.830
We're going to show you a really
cool way of building a sort

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.160
of a low dimensional generative model
called Principal Component Analysis.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.480
It was first done not first, but
became popular when done for

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.020
face recognition, and
that's a form of a general model.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.174
But more important, you'll just
learn about principle components.

00:00:23.174 --> 00:00:25.660
Which is used a lot in computer vision,
and for all sorts of things.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.900
And after we do that,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.270
we're going to move to this other set
of methods which are discriminative.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.970
Where instead of modeling the,
the, categories themselves,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.000
instead we learn about the boundaries
between the categories.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.420
And that we'll continue to do as
we talk more about recognition.
