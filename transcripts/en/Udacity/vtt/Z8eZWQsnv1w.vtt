00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.050
Next let's talk about how [UNKNOWN] uses

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.880
the memory's available in the clients for

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.860
cooperatively caching the files and reducing the

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.262
stress on the management of data files. In

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:16.730
[UNKNOWN] as supposed to traditional Unix file

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.640
system, they also worry about the coherence

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.400
of files. I mentioned earlier that in

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.840
Unix file system, the file server assumes that

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.820
it is serving each client independently, and therefore it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.910
doesn't worry about sharing a file, if a particular

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.030
file happens to be access by multiple users at

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.830
the same time, the server doesn't worry about the coherence

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.940
of that file. But on the other hand in

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.270
XFS the file system worries about cache coherence and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.230
I have already introduced the idea of cache coherence

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.610
in the context of multi processes and distributed shared memory.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.590
So you are familiar with the terminology single writer,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.580
multiple reader meaning that a particular file. We have,

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.110
at any point of time, only a single writer.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.209
There cannot be multiple writers to the same file,

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.970
but it can have multiple readers at the same

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.030
time. And the unit of cache coherence that XFS

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.100
maintains is at the level of file blocks, not

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.950
an entire file. But at the level of individual

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.540
file blocks. So if you look at, a

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.790
manager for a file, the guy that is responsible

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.640
for the metadata management for the file. It

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.230
has information about the files for which it is

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.460
the manager. Let's say it has a file f1 for which it has a mana, it is

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.110
a manager. Then the metadata in the memory of

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.170
this manager will have information about the current state

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.750
of that file. For instance, this particular entry says that a file f1 managed by

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.180
this manager is being read concurrently by two

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.870
different clients, c1 and c2. So there are

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.500
two different clients, c1 and c2, and they have copies of this file that they

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.940
have retrieved from this manager at some point

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.700
of time, which means that the client caches,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.770
c1 and c2, contain the contents of this

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.970
file. Now for simplicity, I'm showing this as

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.730
a file, but in fact the granularity at

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.190
which the coherence and information about files is

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.370
kept is at a file block level. So at a block level the manager says a particular

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.910
block of a file is in the cache of client C1 and in the cache of

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.960
client C2. And yet I'm using the word cache to mean that it is in the memory.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.010
Of these clients. So the semantics that is observed

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.680
for cache coherence, a single writer, multiple readers. So if client c3

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.240
makes a request to the manager for writing to

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.020
this file, f1, and again, I have to mentioned

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.610
that, the request is going to be at the granularity

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.510
of a file block, but for simplicity, I'm showing

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.370
it as a write request for this file f1.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.480
But you understand that the granularity at which this request

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.310
is being made is for writing a particular block

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.390
of that file. So the manager gets this write request.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.190
It looks up the metadata for that particular file.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.200
And it sees that this file is now currently read-shared

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.690
by two different clients, c1 and c2. This

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.770
guy wants to write to the file. That results

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.910
in a conflict, a read/write conflict, and what the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.090
manager is going to do is basically say, well, if

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.210
somebody wants to write to that file I

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.770
have to tell the guys that currently have the

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.290
file. They cannot have it anymore. So just as

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.150
in the case of cash coherence in a multi-processor.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.770
This manage is going to send an invalidation message for the file F1 to C1. And

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.650
to C2, and they are going to acknowledge

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.630
to the manager saying that yes, we have invalidated

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.080
our local copies of the files, and once

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.740
the manager gets that indication back from the clients,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.870
at that point the manager can tell the

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.300
client C3 that Okay, now you have got dibs

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.910
on writing to this file. That's the protocol that

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.750
is being observed in [UNKNOWN]. To keep the copies

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.230
of the files consistent so at the end of

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.400
this exchange C3 will have the right to, right

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.850
to this particular file. Now how long does it

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.230
have that privilege? Well the write request when it

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.500
is granted the client gets the token And the

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.360
manager, at any point of time, can revoke the token

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.480
that was given to C3. And this in particular

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.990
will happen when a future read for the same file

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.220
comes to the manager. At that point, the manager will

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.210
go to C3 and say, I'm revoking the token from

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.460
you. You cannot write to that file anymore. You can

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.120
read it because the request that I got is only

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.690
a read request and therefore you can keep the file,

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.600
but you cannot write to it anymore. If you want

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.660
to write it again, then you have to make

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.170
a request again. This is the protocol that is observed.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.700
And of course, if a particular client is writing to

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.550
a file, and another client also wants to write to

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.930
the same file, at that point the manager once

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.730
again is going to invoke the token, invalidate the file

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.750
at this client, pull back the contents of the file,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.650
and then distribute it to a future requester who wants

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.890
to write to the same file. That's how cache coherence works. And using

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.820
the fact that copies of the file is existing in multiple

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.280
clients excepts as exploits that fact to do cooperative caching.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.210
What that means is that if a client is currently

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.120
having a copy of the file, let's say, after this interchange.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.330
C3 has a copy of the file. There is also writing to A future read request comes.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.990
When it comes, that read request can be satisfied by getting the

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.770
contents of the file from the cache of C3. And that is what cooperative

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.330
caching is all about, where instead of going to the disk to retrieve the file

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.500
&gt;&gt; We can actual get the file content from the cache of one of the clients

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.240
that happens to have a copy of the file.
