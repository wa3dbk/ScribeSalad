00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.713
Morphing is the process of changing from one model to another. It's a fairly

00:00:03.713 --> 00:00:07.175
tricky problem to solve if the two objects are quite different. For example, if

00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:09.830
I want to morph a cube into a unicorn model, I'll have to create a bunch of

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.422
vertices on the cube and decide how these move in a convincing way. Much

00:00:14.422 --> 00:00:14.913
simpler is to

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:15.282
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:18.941
between two meshes with the same number of vertices. In this case, linear

00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:22.358
interpolation between the two meshes is trivial. A more general approach uses

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:27.040
what are called morph targets or key poses. A simple example is a smile. Say we

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.584
have three poses, a neutral pose, a smile an a frown. To go from one to the

00:00:31.584 --> 00:00:35.651
other we can interpolate. Essentially the key poses are similar to key frames

00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:39.711
to interpolate between. By changing the amount of influence a particular target

00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:43.734
has affects the result. For example, I could specify a half smile by saying to

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:48.562
have each vertex be half the neutral pose, half the smile pose. A further

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:51.953
advantage of morph targets is that they can be combined. For example, I could

00:00:51.953 --> 00:00:55.785
have key poses for an eyebrow and use it as I wish with a smile or frown. A

00:00:55.785 --> 00:01:00.559
pose can be associated with parts of a mesh and so influence only them. For

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.985
example, here I'm using the wonderful ginger demo by Stickman Ventures. They'e

00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:07.204
a slighter set on many different facial features. By changing a setting, I'm

00:01:07.204 --> 00:01:11.550
changing the influence of the morph target. Even skinned models can be exported

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.200
and treated as morph targets. Morph targets are well supported by 3JS and so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.254
are a popular way to display animated models. The main drawback on the modeling

00:01:19.254 --> 00:01:23.367
end is that it's labor intensive to create morph targets. The whole process of

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:25.991
setting up a character's animation controls is called rigging, and one that

00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:30.254
take skill and time to do properly. Such processes are almost always done with

00:01:30.254 --> 00:01:33.933
interactive modelling and animation programs. Another drawback is that morphing

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:37.082
needs much more data than skinning while running an animation, both to download

00:01:37.082 --> 00:01:41.854
and to keep in the GPU's memory. All that said, morphing has the advantage of

00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:45.894
being generic. Any model changes can be saved into morph targets and there's no

00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:49.706
real ambigity. Skinning cannon is done in a myriad of different ways with

00:01:49.706 --> 00:01:53.740
research continuing to find new techniques. Lots of tears have been shed by

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.344
many developers trying to convert skinning animations from one format to

00:01:56.344 --> 00:01:57.530
another.
