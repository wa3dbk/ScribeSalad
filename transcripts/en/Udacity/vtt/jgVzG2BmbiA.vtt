So Susan's right. Phineas didn't die, but he did experience immediate changes

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.994
to his personality. Before the accident, he was a really mild mannered and kind

00:00:07.994 --> 00:00:13.330
person. But immediately following, he was argumentative and really impulsive.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.635
He was even known to be really offensive sometimes. But remember, he was not

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:20.873
like this before the accident. So it's cases such as these that give us insight

00:00:20.873 --> 00:00:25.044
into what parts of the brain are responsible for different behaviors. But let's

00:00:25.044 --> 00:00:27.753
go back to the PDF and learn more about the brain section so we can answer some

00:00:27.753 --> 00:00:29.463
questions about it.
