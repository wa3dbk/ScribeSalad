You can change Udacity logo on the page simply by selecting the element and

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.540
changing the source of the image tag.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.080
Here I've used a nested selection.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.630
So first, I select the a tag that's the link with class navbar-brand and .logo

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.780
so the a tag needs to have both navbar-brand and logo and within that selection.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.440
So within the a tag, we then select whichever image tag is in there.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.759
Change the attribute of the source to what

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.670
here is a URL to the zip [INAUDIBLE] academy logo.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.320
As you can see here but

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.800
it's a little bit hard given the background of the nav-bar.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.660
The logo is now pointing to [INAUDIBLE] logo.
