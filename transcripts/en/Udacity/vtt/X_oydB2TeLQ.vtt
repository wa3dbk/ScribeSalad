00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.719
Just because our server can
listen on every single port, for

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.700
any type of request,
that doesn't mean we should.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.440
The rule of least privilege, which we've
discussed throughout this entire lesson,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.100
tells us we should only listen
on the ports required for

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.630
our application to function correctly.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.820
We can configure which ports we
want our server to listen to

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.160
using an application called a firewall.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.280
Let's imagine this wall is
our firewall application.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.700
And each of these slots is a port.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.310
We currently have all the slots filled,
which means I can't

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.550
pass data from one side, the Internet,
to the other, my server.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.930
You could say I'm denying
all incoming requests, but

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.000
if I open one of these boxes,
we'll choose port 80 here.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.490
I can now pass information through.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.070
The server on the other side can
now fully function as a web server

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.280
with the added benefit of
completely ignoring these requests

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.460
that we know we're not interested in.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.650
Let's go back to our terminal and start
configuring our server's firewall now.
