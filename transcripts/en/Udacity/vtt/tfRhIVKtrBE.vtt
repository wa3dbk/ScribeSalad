00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.009
So how would you use learning by correcting mistakes,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.630
to design an agent that can answer Raven's progressive matrices? On one level,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.480
this might seem easy. Your agent is able to check to see if its answers

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.130
are correct, so it's aware of when it makes a mistake. But the knowledge of

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.280
when it's made a mistake, merely triggers the process of correcting the mistake.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.990
It doesn't correct it itself. So how will your agent isolate its mistake?

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.710
What exactly is it isolating here? Once it's isolated the mistake,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.080
how will it explain the mistake? And how will that explanation then be used to

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.670
correct its mistake so it doesn't make the same mistake in the future? Now in

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.360
this process we can ask ourselves, will your agent correct the mistake itself?,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.160
or will you use the output to correct the mistake in your agent's reasoning?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Will you look at what it did and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.810
say, here's the mistake it made. So next time it shouldn't make that mistake.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.580
If you're the one using your agents reasoning to correct your agent,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.580
then as we've asked before, who's the intelligent one? You? Or your agent?
