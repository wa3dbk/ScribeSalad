00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.050
Let's apply what we just learned by opening up

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.390
the MainActivity.java file within our project. We're going to take

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.830
this networking code snippet and move it over to

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.200
it's own AsyncTask, so it runs in a background

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.160
thread. The task is going to be defined within

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.070
this fragment class. But speaking of which, it's actually

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.300
still called PlaceholderFragment. Let's do a little bit of

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.365
refactoring now by giving it a real name. Let's call

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:28.463
it ForecastFragment. And then you can update it

00:00:28.463 --> 00:00:31.560
in other appropriate places as well. We can also

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.560
move ForecastFragment into its own file that way

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.412
the MainActivity won't get so long and cumbersome. Within

00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:41.284
ForecastFragment we should define a new inner class

00:00:41.284 --> 00:00:45.290
called FetchWeatherTask which extends from AsyncTask. And then you

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.770
can move the networking code snippet here. After you

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.840
make the changes and run your app, it should

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.770
look something like this. There really should be no difference except it

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.290
doesn't crash now. In the next step we will add code to execute

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.300
the task. And later in the lesson, we'll do JSON parsing and updating

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.120
the UI. In the meantime though, make these initial changes to your code.
