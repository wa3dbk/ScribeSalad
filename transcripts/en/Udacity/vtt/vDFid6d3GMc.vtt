00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.230
The first step to learning Ember is
to understand how routing works.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.590
When an Ember app is loaded,

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.530
the router's job is to match
the URL against the list of routes.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.880
When it finds a route,
it loads that route's route file and

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.930
renders the associated template.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.670
Right now the base route loads
the application template, but

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.730
we can add to the list of
routes that Ember manages.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.600
We can add a menu route that
loads the menu template.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.260
Now, menu here and
menu here don't have to be the same.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.700
This is what's matched against the URL,
and this is the name of the template.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.990
We could just have easily have named
the template something like food.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.190
So we have our application view and
we can display our list of menu items,

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.630
but we want to be able to
view just one item at a time.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.332
There we go.
Now,

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:45.760
/item/strawberry-pudding will
use the item template.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.820
That was easy, except what about when
we want to view the chicken salad?

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.900
We don't want to create a route and
template for every single menu item.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.720
We can use Ember to make
URL matching dynamic.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.830
Instead of listing each route
to look for, we can do this.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.810
Ember calls this a dynamic segment and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.140
will match anything between
this slash and the next one.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.240
So the router captures the dynamic
segment and passes it to the item route.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.179
A route file is where you put
the business logic for a template.

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.747
The template is then rendered
with data from the route file.

00:01:15.747 --> 00:01:16.350
Awesome.
