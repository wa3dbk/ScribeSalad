00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.450
So today, we've been talking about analogical reasoning. We started by

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.740
talking about similarity. As we saw in our opening exercise, similarity is

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.960
something that we evaluate very easily without even really thinking about it.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.810
How can we design agents that can do the same kind of similarity evaluation?

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.350
We then talked about analogical retrieval, which can be difficult,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.330
because we're trying to retrieve examples across other domains.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.370
How can we structure our knowledge to facilitate this kind of retrieval?

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.450
How can a system know the given a model of the atom,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.940
it should retrieve a model of the solar system? Then we talked about mapping,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.150
which is figuring out which parts of different systems correspond. For example,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.350
how can figure out that the troops in the four example correspond to the lasers

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.040
in the tumor example? We then talk about transfer, which is moving knowledge

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.460
from the concept we know to the concept we don't. For example, we used what we

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.820
knew about the solar system to fill in our knowledge of the atom. Then next,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.680
we talked about evaluation and storage. How do we evaluate our analogies?

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.720
In the tumor example, we might actually try that medical procedure. But for

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.700
other analogies, how do we evaluate them? And then how do we store them for

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.180
future use? Last, we talked about a special kind of analogy, design by analogy,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.790
where we use something that we know a lot about to inform our design of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.330
something new. We'll talk a lot more about this, especially design by analogy,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.470
when we come to the design unit later in our course.
