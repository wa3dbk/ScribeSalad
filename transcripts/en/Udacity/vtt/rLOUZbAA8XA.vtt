00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
As I go through all different actions a, as before,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I now create a new inner loop of going through different action outcomes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This lists is (-1, 0, 1),

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and I set the actual outcome to the adjacent action in the action list.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You might remember the action list is a list of different outcomes.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
By incrementing it by 1 or decrementing it by 1, I can pick a slightly different action in that list.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Of course, I have to do the modulo 4 on the right side.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Then the limitation is similar to before. I project the outcome into new coordinates--x2 and y2.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now I need to assign the probability with this outcome

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
where if they modify a 0, we take the success probability.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If it's not 0, we take 1 minus that divided by 2, because there are 2 possible undesired outcomes.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Then the test proceeds by checking whether this is a legal grid cell,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it's inside the grid, and the grid value is 0.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Then like before, I add the value of the grid cell

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
by now multiplying by the probability of that specific action outcome.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Otherwise, I do the same for the collision cost.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Finally, I take my cumulative value of v2, which I initialized with the cost of motion.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You can't see this right here, but it's filled up.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I update my value function just like before.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You can see the quote over here.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is what you should have programmed.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The key difference to our example in class is the inner loop over here

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
where I go over different possible action outcomes,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
compute the actual action outcome,

00:01:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and then do the probabilistic addition of these outcomes rather than just studying one outcome.
