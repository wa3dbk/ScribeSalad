00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.238
In the Unites States historically, the main source for diagnosing mental

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:09.744
disorders has been the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual or the DSM. And this

00:00:09.744 --> 00:00:14.035
is published by the American Psychiatric Association. This manual uses a

00:00:14.035 --> 00:00:18.796
combination of scientific evidence and clinical observations to determine what

00:00:18.796 --> 00:00:25.267
constitutes diagnosis of a particular disorder. The DSM defines mental disorder

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:31.118
as a syndrome, a set of related conditions. Of clinically significant

00:00:31.118 --> 00:00:36.520
disturbances of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. We want to point out that

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.540
this is an American perspective on psychological disorders, and therefore, it

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.432
may not encompass the perspectives of other cultures on mental health. More

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:50.202
specifically, the DSM 5, which is the latest edition of the manual, argues for

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:55.460
the 4 d's of determining whether something is a mental doisorder. Let's take a

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.024
look at each of these individually, while keeping in mind our continuum that we

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:02.642
discussed earlier, meaning the range on the continuum, from what's considered

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:08.096
to be acceptable, or normal, or normal variations in these categories. Or

00:01:08.096 --> 00:01:13.200
what's considered outside of the normal range of these categories. So, the four

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.216
d's of disorders are disturbance, dysfunctional, distress or disability and

00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:20.590
finally deviance.
