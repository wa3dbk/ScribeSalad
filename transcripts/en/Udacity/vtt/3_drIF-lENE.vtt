00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.420
So, let's say we have something like 26 applications

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.140
in a benchmark suite. How do we summarize the

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.000
overall performance of a machine on the entire suite?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.793
So we want a single number that represents the performance

00:00:11.793 --> 00:00:15.493
of the machine. Usually, we want to use something

00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:19.168
like the average execution time. So let's say we have

00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:22.108
a computer X and a computer Y, a benchmark

00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:25.720
application A, B and C and let's say that computer

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.744
X takes 9 seconds here, 10 seconds here

00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:31.852
and 5 seconds here, whereas the computer Y

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:35.212
takes 18 seconds here, 7 seconds here, and

00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:38.852
11 seconds here. The speed up of machine

00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:44.536
X over machine Y on each of these applications is two for application A

00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:50.906
because X is doing it in half the time as Y, 0.7 on application B because X is

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:57.140
actually slower than Y there. And here is 2.2 because X is more than

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.300
twice as fast as Y. Now let's compute the average execution time. Here we have

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.970
9 plus 10 plus 5 over 3, gives us 8 seconds. So on average, computer X finishes

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.260
one of these three applications in 8 seconds. On average, computer Y finishes

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.290
one of these three in 18 plus 7 plus 11 over 3, 12 seconds.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.190
If we now compute the speedup of X over Y, on average it will be 1.5 when

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.506
computed this way. But if we average the speedups here, we get 1.63. So if we

00:01:35.506 --> 00:01:38.318
want to use average execution times, we can

00:01:38.318 --> 00:01:41.282
not simply average the speed ups on individual

00:01:41.282 --> 00:01:44.610
applications to get the average speed up. Pretty

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.130
much the speed up using average execution times

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.280
is not the same as the average of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.972
speed ups on these individual applications. If we want

00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:59.432
to be able to average speed ups, then we need to use geometric means for both of

00:01:59.432 --> 00:02:02.960
our application execution times and for our speed

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.459
ups. In that case we get a geometric mean

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:15.110
of 7.66 here, 11.15 here, and 1.456 here. So we have used the geometric mean for

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.460
the execution times for each of the computers. If we use the geometric mean for

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.730
these speed ups, we will get the same value here. The geometric mean is computed

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.850
by multiplying out, for example, 9 times 10

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.540
times 5, and then taking the nth root,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.260
in this case 3rd root of the value, to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.772
get the geometric mean. And because things are being

00:02:37.772 --> 00:02:40.546
multiplied out and then the nth root taken you

00:02:40.546 --> 00:02:43.466
can see how, if we divide these things, we will

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:46.459
get that the speed of computed geometric means of

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.233
execution times will be the same as the mean of

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:51.934
the speed ups, because we have third root of

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:56.680
18 times 7 times 11. These two divided is the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.765
same as third root of 9 over 18, times 10 over 7 times 5 over

00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:09.928
11. So as you can see this is the geometric mean of execution times, then we

00:03:09.928 --> 00:03:12.880
can compute the speedup using them, and that's

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.544
the same as the geometric mean of individual

00:03:15.544 --> 00:03:18.610
speed ups. However this only works for geometric

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.070
means. We do prefer average execution time when

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.878
we're computing the average times. However, just

00:03:25.878 --> 00:03:28.386
you must be careful not to compute individual

00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:31.106
speed ups and then average them. Instead,

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:34.362
you should be computing the average execution times

00:03:34.362 --> 00:03:36.656
and then computing the speed up using

00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:41.060
those averages. You should also remember that simple

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.340
average should not be used on ratios of times. So basically a speed up here is

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.770
a ratio of two times. We should not be using a

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.670
simple arithmetic mean on these values

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.180
because they're ratios. Geometric means, on

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.200
the other hand, can be used on ratios, but, for this to

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.180
work, we also have to do the geometric mean on times, too.
