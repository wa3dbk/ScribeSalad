00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.678
In this exercise, you'll start with a directional light pointing at the back of

00:00:02.678 --> 00:00:06.314
the bird. It doesn't look very good. I want you to hook up a slider to the

00:00:06.314 --> 00:00:09.672
light. Use the slider to vary the light's x and z direction by the cosine and

00:00:09.672 --> 00:00:13.696
sine of the angle. In other words, x is related to cosine, z is related to

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:18.450
sine. And by the way, save your solution. You'll reuse it in the next exercise.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.115
When you've got the code running, the program should look like this as you vary

00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:25.910
the angle. Also don't forget the cosine and sine want to be fed radians, not

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.210
degrees.
