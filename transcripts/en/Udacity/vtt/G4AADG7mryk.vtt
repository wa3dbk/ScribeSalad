00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.311
Kyle gave us all this rectangle code but why are you so sure that Kyle's code

00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:08.375
works? Now it's your turn to write a test program for the grill method. If you

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:14.017
create a rectangle like this with an upper left corner, at 45, 90 and a width

00:00:14.017 --> 00:00:21.592
of 60 and a height of 90. Let's say you call it box and you call grow with 20

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:27.670
and 20. So it should grow 20 in this direction, 20 in this direction, 20 in

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:44.121
this direction, and 20 in this direction. What are the actual and expected

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:46.013
values of x, y width and height? Write a test program that compares those

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:46.854
expected values with the actual values.
