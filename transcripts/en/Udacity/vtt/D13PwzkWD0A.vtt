00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
So let's take a look at the channel economics.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.960
In other words, how are we going to make money?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.160
So let's take a look at a direct sales example.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.950
You have a sales force and you're selling directly to the end consumer.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.420
So let's assume that the list price of your product is $100.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.320
So one of the first questions in thinking about how to come up with this $100 list price

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.280
is to understand how much did it actually cost me to manufacture a product.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.100
Now, in the web, it might be the cost my engineers.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.870
But in a physical product, it might be the costed bill of materials coming out of my factory.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.090
And so let's assume for the sake of discussion that that was $33, $33 to build my product.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.590
Next, let's take a look at the cost of my R&amp;D, that is my engineering;

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.600
the cost of my direct sales people, maybe commissions or direct sales compensation;

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.950
and then general and administration costs, what it cost me to have leases and lunches

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.120
and free snacks, and that might be another $20.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.780
And so right now it's $53 just to keep the lights on in my building.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.660
Now something we should consider is that no end-user pays was priced.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:33.390
So let's assume that this area represents a discount from the list price, let's say 10%.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.280
That means your revenue to your company would not be $100 but $90.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.710
So wait a minute, you're getting $90 but you spent a total of $53 building the product

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.920
and keeping the lights on and that leaves right in the middle how much profit you have.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.960
In this case, it would be $37.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.100
So, you're selling costs were embedded here, this was the commission or direct sales costs

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.310
or whatever you were paying your direct sales people and you made $37 selling directly.
