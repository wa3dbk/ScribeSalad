00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.900
What's a vision statement and
how do you get started writing one for

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.170
your business?

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.360
A vision statement is a declaration
of your company objectives,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.240
meant to provide guidance
on the decisions you make.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.850
Basically, it's the big dream
that you have for your business.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.770
You can think of it as the Northstar for
your company.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.190
It helps provide inspiration about what
your business is focused on achieving

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.850
throughout its lifetime.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.230
There's a few basic questions
that a vision statement should

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.580
be able to answer.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.200
Try focusing on questions like these.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.610
What will your business become if
everything goes according to plan?

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.270
Why do you exist?

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.900
And how will your business
change the world?

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.040
You don't want to state specific
ways you go about doing this yet,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.550
just focus on the overarching goal that
you as a business plan to work towards.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.390
And finally,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.260
it's important to consider how long
your vision statement might need to be.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.830
There's really no set length for
a vision statement, but

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.950
there's a few guidelines you
can follow to help write yours.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.080
You want to make sure you have enough
information to provide a sense of

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.830
purpose, a call to action and
an idea of your final destination.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.110
You don't want it to be so
long that it's difficult to understand.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.560
But making it too short can also leave
out the kind of meaning it will need to

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.830
actually guide your business.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.860
One line vision statements
are possible but

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.700
you could have a full paragraph
if that's what it takes.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.000
Just consider that if you want
people to actually read and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.900
remember this, then brief can be better.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.530
Don't be so
broad that you sound generic, but not so

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.910
specific that it won't be
relevant after a couple years.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.940
For example,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.350
Google's vision is to provide access to
the world's information in one click.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.880
Do you notice how their vision focuses
on a bold claim about the overarching

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.710
goal they have for their business?

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.740
Try doing the same for yours.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.950
So, consider some of these ideas and

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.700
look into some of the examples of vision
statements created by other companies.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.510
Once you feel comfortable with
the purpose of a vision statement,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.750
try thinking of one that you
could use for your business.
