00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.155
For this first equation, x plus 5 equals x plus 7, the right side of the

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:08.610
equation is always going to be 2 greater than the left side, since 7 is 2

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:12.870
greater than 5. Since no value of x can make these two sides equal to each

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:17.520
other, this is not an equation. There is some number that we can substitute for

00:00:17.532 --> 00:00:22.660
x though, in the second equation, that gives us 27 when we multiply it by 3. So,

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:27.871
what times 3 equals 27? 9. So, this is an equation. However, other numbers that

00:00:27.883 --> 00:00:32.268
we can put into x like zero would not make this true, so this has to be a

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.280
conditional equation. Our third equation is the same type as the second one.

00:00:37.582 --> 00:00:42.244
Since some values of x make this true. And our last equation is an identity. If

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:46.802
we simplify the expression that we have on the left-hand side, we can combine

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:51.171
like terms, since we know that x and 2x are like terms. And we can make the

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:55.424
left-hand side equal to 3x plus 3, which is exactly the same as the right-hand

00:00:55.725 --> 00:01:00.198
side. No matter what we plug in for x, these two will be equal. So this is an

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.751
identity.
