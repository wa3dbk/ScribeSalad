00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.102
So, here's a different ellipse. What do you think would be the center for this

ellipse? What do you think the a value is and what do you think the b value is?

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.036
Keep in mind that for an ellipse, the easiest way to find these values is to

00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:16.152
set this equation equal to one.
