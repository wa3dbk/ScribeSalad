00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.190
The other participants in the meeting are the reviewers.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.210
These ae the people responsible for raising the issues. Not to say that the,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.280
the moderator or the recorder or the reader can't list some issues,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.230
but their, their primary focus is going to be on their other, on,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.340
on their individual roles, whereas the reviewers, the job here is to do

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.630
exactly that. To review the artifact and to point out raise, raise issues.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.750
Typically a meeting will have three to six reviewers, fewer run the risk of

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.180
not having enough eyes on the target and more can be overkill.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.350
Right not being effective as far as the, the time invested in, and the number of

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.330
defects found. Reviewers should raise issues by asking questions, as opposed to

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.960
saying that's a problem. They should not explicitly suggest improvements, but

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.270
rather ask if the author thought about doing things in an alternative fashion.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.230
The viewer should not blatantly assert defects, but

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.870
ask what would happen under different circumstances.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.310
By taking a questioning attitude, the team can productively raise issues without

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.769
getting diverted by emotionally driven debates.
