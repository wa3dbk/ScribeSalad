We can factor an a from ax and ay so we have a times x plus y. We can also

00:00:04.943 --> 00:00:10.345
factor a 2 from 2x and 2y. So we'll have plus 2 times x plus y. And notice if we

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:15.688
were to just distribute we'd get back with what we started with. But in this

00:00:15.688 --> 00:00:21.339
line there's something incredible happening. This would be one term made up of

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.854
two factors a times x plus y. This would be another term made up of two factors,

00:00:26.854 --> 00:00:31.742
2 and x plus y. So do you see it? What's the common factor for each of these

00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:33.880
terms? Write your answer here.
