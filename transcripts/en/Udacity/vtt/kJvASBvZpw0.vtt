00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.830
In lesson 14, we examined ways we could analyze the relationship between two

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.250
numerical variables using scatter plots and Pearson's r. Remember that r is a

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.149
measure of the strength of their relationship, and looks at how x and y vary

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:21.720
together as opposed to how they each vary independently. We also noted that we

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.880
can describe linear data using a straight line drawn through the middle of the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.690
data. In this lesson, we will discuss this straight line in more detail, and

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.600
explain why it's useful for describing linear relationships and making

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.580
predictions. This straight line has several names. One is the regression line.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.820
Another more intuitive name is the line of best fit. We care about the line of

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.320
best fit, because it helps us describe the data for one thing. In other words,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.670
we can describe the patterns shown by the data. This line makes it easier to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.120
see the relationship between x and y. In this lesson, we'll only focus on

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.480
linear relationships. Meaning relationships that follow a linear trend in one

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.210
direction. Not only does the line help us visualize the data, but it helps us

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.040
make predictions. We can use the line to predict what the y value will be for a

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.730
particular x value. By knowing the equation, we can plug in this x value, say x

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.370
star, and find the corresponding y value, y star. Our predictions won't be

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.550
perfectly accurate, but we can often get a fairly good estimate for the value

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.200
of y.
