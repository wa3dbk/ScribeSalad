00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.826
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So let's look at some numbers that multiplied, equal 15. Well,of course we

00:00:05.826 --> 00:00:11.599
have 15 and 1, but 15 plus 1 is not 8, so that can't be right. What else? 3

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.399
times 5. 3 times 5 equals 15. And, look at that. 3 plus 5. If we plug those two

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:22.617
numbers in over here, equals 8. So, one of these must be 3 and one has to be 5.

00:00:22.617 --> 00:00:27.663
So, now we know that x squared plus 8x plus 15 equals x plus 3 times x plus 5,

00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:33.122
awesome. Now get ready for a little bit more practice, with factoring just like

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:33.542
this.
