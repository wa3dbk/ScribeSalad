00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.840
Remember that this plus or minus symbol actually indicates that we're going to

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.692
have two separate numbers here. There are two numbers contained in this line

00:00:07.692 --> 00:00:11.886
right now. One that's equal to negative 1 plus this quantity, and one that's

00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:16.119
equal to negative 1 minus this quantity. What I'd like you to do now is to find

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.315
the two values of x that are produced by this. Remember what this symbol means

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:24.347
to get you those two different answers, and when you find them, round each of

00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:28.401
them to two decimal places. Please put the answer that is the lower number in

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:31.989
the top box, and the answer that is higher number in the bottom box.
