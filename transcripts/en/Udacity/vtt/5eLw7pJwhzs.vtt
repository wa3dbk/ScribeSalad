00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.960
As far as the three other system qualities in

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.630
an object oriented architectural style, performance has problems because of

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.210
the many small objects linked to multiple context switches.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.990
And delegation, okay,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.100
whereby one object may refer to others to provide its functionality,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.290
this can increase indirection, which can reduce responsiveness of the system.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.450
With respect to reliability, decentralized control in

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.950
object oriented system reduces opportunity for oversight.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.820
But encapsulation can reduce vulnerability to undin, unintended interactions.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.410
For safety, the correspondence between the real-world entities which the system

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.860
is is modeling, and the objects that the programmer has

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.110
developed can improve the intentionality of the system and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.450
accountability, thereby enhancing the safety of the system.
