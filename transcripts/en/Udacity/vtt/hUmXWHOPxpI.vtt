00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.080
There's a few answers to where are all the circles, but the shortest and

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.440
simplest is that they're simply on the page.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.190
If we do a D3 select all circle, we can see that it returns an array

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.325
of 836 elements that correspond to circles.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:19.280
SVG ones.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.700
When I hover however, notice that the circles show up at

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.660
pixel zero by one in the top left of the screen.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.689
If you actually inspect the DOM, you'll see that they are indeed there.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.210
So our data bind in append has correctly worked.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.840
It appended 836 circles to our webpage which are bound to data.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.330
And again, if I access one of those circles, let's just get the first one, so

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.970
select all circles, get the internal array and then get the first circle.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.840
It returns to us a circle DOM element.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.790
But remember when we did data binding,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:03.740
I told you that every element with bound data has an __data_.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.444
And as you can see here, by accessing the .__data__

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:14.320
attribute of the first circle SVG object,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.390
you get returned a JavaScript object with all the data that's been bound to it.
