Sometimes mutators are useful. But they can be tricky to think about. For

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.630
example, what does this sequence of statements make? First, we create a

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.970
variable box of type Rectangle, and put a Rectangle in it. Then, we create

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.890
another variable of the same type, but I want it to be the same. So, I'm just

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.590
going to use box. Now, I actually realize I need to get the original box out of

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.580
the way. So, I'm just going to translate it. So, this would look something

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.260
like, we would create a rectangle. And then, we create another rectangle that's

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.800
the same. Then, we translate it out of the way. What is the value of box.getX?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.832
What is the value of box2.getX?
