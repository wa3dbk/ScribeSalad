00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
An important application of that is to do digital signatures.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We think of physical signatures as authenticating documents.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
When something is signed, that means that the signer is responsible for the message in the document.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Physical signatures don't actually work very well for this purpose.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Someone can cut and paste a physical signature or maybe they can modify the document

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
after it's signed.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There's nothing that really guarantees that the signature and the document are matched.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What we want with digital signatures is something much stronger than that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We want something that shows that the person who signed it agreed to the message,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and the message can't be changed without also breaking the signature.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
How can we do that with asymmetric cryptography?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Here is our goal: we want Alice to be able to sign a message, transmit that message to Bob,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Bob should be able to read the message.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and know that it could only have come from Alice.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The question is what should we use for the respective keys k1 and k2

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in order to provide that digital signature where the message that Bob receives

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
proves that it was signed by Alice?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Here are the choices.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We've used for k1 Alice's public key and k2 Alice's private key.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
For the second choice we'll use Bob's public key for k1 and Bob's private key for k2.

00:01:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For the third choice we'll use Alice private key for k1 and Alice's public key for k2.
