Now, where were we with Grant? Oh, that's right. He was on an airplane, going

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:08.952
from his hometown to this wonderful, wonderful city called Udacity. We reduced

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:13.333
that map to a right triangle, just like this one. Now, can you tell me how long

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:17.677
the flight path from his hometown to Udacity is? Please round to the nearest

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:18.420
whole number.
