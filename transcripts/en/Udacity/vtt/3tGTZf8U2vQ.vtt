Now all of these theories are great, but there's a problem here. Say we need to

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.660
see if a drug can affect a child's intellectual development, well we need to

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.240
have a way to measure intelligence. But how do we measure intelligence? Well

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.020
the first thing you need to know is that intelligence is what psychologists

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.128
call a hypothetical construct. Meaning it's an idea that can't be directly seen

00:00:22.128 --> 00:00:25.790
or measured, so it can only be indirectly measured.
