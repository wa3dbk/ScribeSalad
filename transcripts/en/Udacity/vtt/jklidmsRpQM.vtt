00:00:00.036 --> 00:00:05.174
Assuming that you're already using a library--say, the equivalent of one of these libraries on the CPU,

00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:09.943
then porting to use one of the GPU libraries is a simple 3-step process.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:14.587
First, you need to substitute library calls with their equivalent, CUDA library calls.

00:00:14.587 --> 00:00:17.728
So if you're using blas, and you call the function SAXPY--

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:21.230
stands for Single Precision AX plus Y,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.595
then you will simply shift that to be a call to cublas SAXPY.

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:28.114
Next, you need to manage data locality,

00:00:28.114 --> 00:00:31.901
so if you are going to be running on the GPU, you want the data to already be on the GPU.

00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:36.606
So for example you might need to call CUDA Malloc and CUDA Memcpy

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:39.772
to move the data on the GPU where the library can use to it.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:45.054
Cublas as CUDA cublas Alloc, cublas SetVector, cublas get vector, for getting the result.

00:00:45.054 --> 00:00:50.420
And some of the libraries manage this entirely transparently for you, and others you do it explicitly.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.531
And finally, step 3, you want to rebuild and link with the CUDA accelerated library;

00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:58.531
for example, calling the compiler with the -L cublas line.
