The answer is, we don't need any imports between crawler and search. There's no

00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:07.822
definitions in crawler that are used by search and there's no definitions in

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:11.659
search that are used by crawler. But we do need imports in test. And we need

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:16.344
both of these, we need test to import crawler since it's using crawl_web, which

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:20.670
is coming from crawler. We also need test import search since it's using

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.623
lucky_search and ordered_search, which are coming from search.
