I keep wanting to post things on Twitter. But the character limit is so small,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.055
I can't say what I want to say. Help me write a method to shorten my Twitter

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:12.419
posts by only printing the consonants. So how did I ever program without loops,

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.074
would come out like this. You should put your code in the shortened method of

00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:17.750
the Twitterizer class.
