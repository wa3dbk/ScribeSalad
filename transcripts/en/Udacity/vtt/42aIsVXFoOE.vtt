00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.288
So now, that we've got an idea of how to use function notation in the context of

00:00:04.288 --> 00:00:08.514
equations, how do we actually use it? Well, it gives us a sort of short hand, as

00:00:08.514 --> 00:00:13.298
we saw in a couple of quizzes before. For instance, if someone walks up to me

00:00:13.298 --> 00:00:18.638
and asks me, what is the value of x squared minus x plus 2, when x is equal to

00:00:18.638 --> 00:00:22.878
2? Well, function notation comes in super handy here. If we recognize that x

00:00:22.878 --> 00:00:28.926
squared minus x plus 2 is a function where x is the independent variable, the

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:34.782
same thing is asking, if f of x equals x squared minus x plus 2, then what is f

00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:40.275
of 2? So actually, just because I know you want to solve this problem, what is f

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:42.873
of 2? Please fill your answer into this box.
