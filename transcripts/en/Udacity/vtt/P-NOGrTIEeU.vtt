00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.920
The operating system plays
a really critical role

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.600
in protecting resources
in a computer system.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.900
Resources such as memory pages, or

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.990
files, that might
contain sensitive data.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.730
It makes use of hardware
functionality and

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.870
uses that to isolate itself
from un-trusted user code, and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.510
also can isolate one user's process
from a different user' s process.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.430
So we're going to see how that
is done by the operating system.
