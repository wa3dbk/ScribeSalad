00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.330
Let's check our understanding
of N-module redundancy.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.970
Suppose we have a computer and we want
to tolerate faults that can occur there.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.350
So we go to store and buy two more
computers just like the first one and

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.590
put all of them on the same desk.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.780
And our approach to redundancy
is that we run every computation

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.020
on all three computers,
we compare their outputs, and

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.170
we take that output on which two or
all three agree.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.110
And with this approach we think
we can tolerate any single event

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.660
of the following kinds.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.960
Check each of those
that can be tolerated.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.620
Can we tolerate any single alpha
particle strike in a processor?

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.220
Can we tolerate any
single building collapse?

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.960
Can we tolerate any single earthquake?

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.290
And can we tolerate any mistake
in single processor design?
