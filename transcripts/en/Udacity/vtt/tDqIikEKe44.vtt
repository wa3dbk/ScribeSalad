First the information is received by the dendrites, then it passes through to

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:09.213
the soma, the cell body. Then after it passes through the soma, it moves on to

00:00:09.213 --> 00:00:13.984
the axon. Then from the axon, it moves on to the terminal buttons. Then finally

00:00:13.984 --> 00:00:15.560
into the synapse.
