00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.449
Further restrictions can be built into a reflection model, such as maintaining

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.186
energy conservation. This means that there's not more energy reflected from the

00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:10.574
surface than shines on it. For example, the diffuse term should drop off when

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:14.081
the specular term is stronger. This sort of reflection model is called

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:17.910
physically-based since it has some relationship to how light truly works.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.165
Within film production and game creation there's a trend towards

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:23.334
physically-based systems. One advantage is that materials are more

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:26.965
understandable by artists. For example, with our energy balanced Blinn-Phong

00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:29.890
material we can adjust the shininess without worrying as much that we'll also

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.615
have to adjust the overall intensity. One element in a physically-based system

00:00:34.615 --> 00:00:38.266
is getting the materials right, but that's just to start. For example, the time

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.368
of day might change from daytime to twilight, so that the overall illumination

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:45.266
in the scene is considerably less. Instead of making everything dark, some

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:49.084
rendering systems try to adapt. This is similar to what a photographer does by

00:00:49.084 --> 00:00:52.391
adjusting the exposure. One way is to compute a high precision image and

00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:55.625
automatically change the brightness and contrast to make the displayed image

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:59.892
look good. This sort of analysis and display is called tone mapping and is

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:03.529
fairly commonly used in games and other applications now.
