00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.060
In this architecture for a cognitive system, we have drawn these boxes as if

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.500
metacognition was completely separate from deliberation and

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.800
deliberation was completely separate from reaction. In fact,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.450
there might be considerable overlap between metacognition and deliberation.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.980
Some processes in deliberation might be viewed as metacognitive processes.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.890
Some processes are metacognitive might be viewed as deliberative processes.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.540
To see where the lines between metacognition and deliberation are blurry.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.320
Let us return to this example from explanation based learning. When we talked

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.520
about explanation based learning, we did not talk about metacognition at all.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.790
We can view the agent as saying, well, I do not know how to build a connection

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.000
between this part of the explanation and this part of the explanation.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.590
Therefore, I'll set up a reasoning goal which pulls at some other knowledge, and

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.180
so on. Now that we know the vocabulary of megacognition,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.790
it is easy to view all of that in terms of this new vocabulary. So, instead of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.190
thinking of deliberation and metacognition as two separate independent boxes,.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.790
A better way might be, to think in terms of boxes that partially overlap,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.340
as a meta space and as a deliberation space. We should not be overly concerned,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.630
whether something should go into the deliberation space into the metacognition

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.340
space. The more important thing is, what is the content of knowledge that we

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.510
need to carry out a process and what is the process that we need to carry out.
