00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this unit, I'll teach you about a term called correlation.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's an important statistical term and in the end of this unit, you'll be able to use it yourself.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Here's the fundamental problem.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Sometimes, there are lines done very nicely like these points over here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Other times, two variables seem to be utterly unrelated.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Correlation is a measure that lies within -1 all the way to 1.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That tells us how far the data is described by a line.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In both cases, you can fit a line but in one case

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it would be a really good description of the data whereas in the others don't.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So the correlation coefficient of what we call r is 1 if the data is perfectly aligned for the line.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's 0 if there seems to be no relation between the two different axes and the data, and it can also be -1.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In the case where the data in fact is still perfectly aligned but there's a negative relationship

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
between one variable and the other variable.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Let me see if you got this.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Here are three data sets--in one, we have a strongly positive correlation; in another,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it's above zero, and in the third one, it will be a negative correlation.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Which of these cases best describe those conditions

00:01:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and use each condition exactly once here.
