&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The highest point on the graph is right here where Grant's ball is going to

00:00:04.038 --> 00:00:07.922
go through the hoop. Looking at our graph, it looks like that point is at

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:12.413
sixteen, eighteen. This point that lies halfway along the parabola, which we can

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:16.439
think of kind of cutting the parabola in half, and which in this case is the

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.750
peak of the curve, is known as the vertex. We'll talk a lot more about this in a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.435
little bit.
