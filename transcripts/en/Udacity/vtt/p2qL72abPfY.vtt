00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.904
So, as I said, there's a theory of intelligence called the Cattell-Horn-Carroll

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:08.196
theory of Intelligence. This is the best known compromise between the singular

00:00:08.196 --> 00:00:12.672
intelligence theory and the multiple intelligences theory. This theory focuses

00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:16.745
on the idea that intelligence comes in two distinct forms. Fluid and

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:21.476
crystallized intelligence. Now if you remember from lesson five on development,

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:26.010
fluid intelligence was the raw intelligence. This is the processing power and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.680
it's relatively free from the culture and environmental influences.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.112
Crystallized intelligence on the other hand reflects what you learn from your

00:00:33.112 --> 00:00:37.550
environment and your experiences. Let's look at the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.280
as a hierarchy. It focuses on three broad levels. The first level is the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.941
general intelligence or the g factor. The second level is the broad level of

00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:51.625
intelligence. They're usually your general abilities. This is where your

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:55.728
crystallized intelligence and your fluid intelligence comes into play. As well

00:00:55.728 --> 00:00:59.900
as things like, your general memory, or your processing speed. Now there's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.319
other abilities that go in this level, but these are the main four. And finally

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:06.763
the last level, is the narrow level. This consists of specific forms of

00:01:06.763 --> 00:01:11.460
cognitive abilities from each of the broader domains. For example, with

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.484
crystallized intelligence, it would be things like reading, spelling, or

00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:18.850
language comprehension. And for fluid intelligence, it would be things like

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.611
speed of reasoning or facial reasoning. The main idea here is that intelligence

00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:27.719
would be a hierarchy. We start with the general idea of intelligence, the g

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.854
factor, one intelligence. Then we go to a more broad level. This includes

00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:35.787
abilities such as crystallized and fluid intelligence, or memory and processing

00:01:35.787 --> 00:01:40.493
speed, among others. Then finally, from there, it narrows down into specific

00:01:40.493 --> 00:01:42.980
abilities for each one of these.
