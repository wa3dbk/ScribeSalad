00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.389
12 minus 3 is 9. So, the right side has become 9 at the point when X is by

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:08.954
itself. Our equation thus tells us that X equals 9. There is one more step

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:13.814
though, we need to check our answer. That basically means confirming that the

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:18.561
value of X we found actually makes this original equation, X plus 3 equals 12,

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:19.331
true.

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:24.528
So you need to substitute our 9 in the place of x in that first equation. And

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.655
sure enough, if we take one more step, 9 plus 3 is in fact equal to 12. This

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:31.574
means that our answer works.
