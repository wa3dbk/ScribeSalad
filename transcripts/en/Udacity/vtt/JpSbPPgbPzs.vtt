00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.690
Now on to launching a cluster.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.850
It's better to use
the advanced options so

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.720
you have more control over
the nodes in the cluster.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.458
You can choose which applications
you want to install in the cluster.

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:14.208
Let's just stick with the Hadoop and
Hive for now.

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:18.250
You won't be doing any additional
configuration so skip this part.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.120
But do read up on configuration in
the future as the default settings

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.520
such as the block size
might not fit your needs.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.530
But do read up on the configuration in
the future as the default settings such

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.770
as the block size might
not fit your needs.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.928
Here you can add the steps that
the cluster will run when it's created.

00:00:36.928 --> 00:00:38.940
You can have the cluster
terminate itself after all

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.978
the steps are completed.

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:42.757
This is a convenient way to run
a bunch of analysis jobs without

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:44.098
having a permanent cluster.

00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:48.139
For now, we'll leave this unchecked
since we want to keep the cluster around

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.708
for a bit.

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:51.688
Next, you can add nodes to the cluster.

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:54.818
The master node doesn't need
much computation power.

00:00:54.818 --> 00:00:57.668
So this could be a smaller,
less expensive instance.

00:00:57.668 --> 00:01:01.848
Amazon suggests you should
use M1.large instance.

00:01:01.848 --> 00:01:05.778
The core nodes are used to store and
process data.

00:01:05.778 --> 00:01:08.549
You need to create enough core
nodes to store your input data,

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.638
taking into account
the replication factor.

00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:15.300
By default, replication factors three
for a cluster of ten or more nodes,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.814
two for a cluster of four to nine nodes,
and one for a cluster with three or

00:01:19.814 --> 00:01:20.705
fewer nodes.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:26.298
For now, I’ll just choose two m3.xlarge
instances just the default setting.

00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:29.468
Task nodes are used solely for
processing data.

00:01:29.468 --> 00:01:32.968
You won’t use any now, so leave this
at 0 and continue with the setup.

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:37.815
You should point the login directory
to a folder on your s3 bucket then

00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:38.808
continue on.

00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:42.776
Finally, continue without a private key
or choose one you've used previously and

00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:44.428
is still around on your computer.

00:01:44.428 --> 00:01:48.568
You can use this key to SSH into
the cluster instances later.

00:01:48.568 --> 00:01:50.168
Now create the cluster.

00:01:50.168 --> 00:01:51.908
After a few minutes, it'll be ready.

00:01:51.908 --> 00:01:57.328
You can add more core and
task nodes here by clicking Resize.

00:01:57.328 --> 00:02:00.448
You run jobs on the cluster
by adding steps through here.

00:02:00.448 --> 00:02:01.590
This is what you'll be doing next.
