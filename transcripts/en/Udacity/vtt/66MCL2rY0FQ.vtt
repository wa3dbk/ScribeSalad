Generally speaking, you won't have these symbols on your keyboard. You can find

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.710
them in your character map and you are welcome to use them if you'd like to.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.455
But for the exercises in the rest of this lesson and in the next lesson,

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:13.000
feel free to use the symbols given over here. These are the symbols for AND,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.600
NOT, OR and Equals that come from Java or Python. So, feel free these when you

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.540
are doing the exercises that you'll come across in the rest of this lesson.
