00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.215
The numerator of our fractional exponents represents a power, since this one

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:09.356
comes from a power that's inside the radical or 4 to the 1. The same is true

00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:13.314
for our cubed roots. Each of these is raised to the first power, so we see that

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:17.751
one and each of the fractional exponents. And the denominator actually

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:21.945
represents the index of the root. The 2 is the index of a square root, and a 3

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:27.230
is the index of a cubed root. It tells us what type of root we're taking. The

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.389
denominators of the fractional powers on the left indicate that we're taking a

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:34.483
square root. Whereas the denominators in the fractional powers on the right

00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:37.440
indicate that we're taking a cubed root.
