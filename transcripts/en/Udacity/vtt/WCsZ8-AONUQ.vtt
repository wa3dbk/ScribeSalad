00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.580
Let's return to the problem of guaranteeing

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.490
origin and path authentication. To guarantee these

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.550
properties there is a proposal to modify

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.810
the existing border gateway protocol to add signatures

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.610
to various parts of the route advertisement.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.880
This proposal is sometimes called Secure BGP

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.610
or BGPSEC The proposal has two different

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.760
parts. The first part is an origin attestation,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.160
which is a certificate that binds the IP

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.850
prefix to the organization that owns that prefix,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.850
including the origin AS. This is sometimes also

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.480
called an address attestation. Now, this certificate must

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.160
be signed by a trusted party. That trusted

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.190
party might be, for example, a routing registry

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.410
or the organization that allocated that prefix to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.120
that organization in the first place. The second

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.410
part of BGPSEC is what's called a path attestation which are a

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.440
set of signatures that accompany the AS path as it is advertised from

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.080
one AS to the next. Let's have a closer look at BGPSEC's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.480
path attestation and the types of attacks that it can and cannot prevent.
