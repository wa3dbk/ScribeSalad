00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.090
Now let's look at how we can do debugging within

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.240
Eclipse. I created a new file called AddNumbers which I'm

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.770
showing here. It takes two numbers, parses them into integers,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.870
adds them and prints the sum, supposedly, of the two numbers.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.450
Now we look at the run configuration for this program,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.670
and here you can see that we're passing two arguments,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.060
two and five, to the program. So now let's run

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.468
our program and see what happens. And the result says that

00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:28.150
2 plus 5 is equal to 10, which is not

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.030
exactly correct. So we need to debug our program. We

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.310
need to figure out what's wrong with the program, why

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.140
the wrong result was, produced. So we're going to add a break

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.260
point here by double-clicking here on the side of the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.940
code. And the break point is basically a place where I'm

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.240
telling my debugger to stop during the execution because I

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.750
want to inspect the state of the program. So to start

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.690
debugging, we select Debug as Java Application from the Context

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.170
menu, similar to what we were doing for running the program.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.190
And as you can see, this asks us whether we want

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.720
to pass to the debug perspective, which is a, a perspective

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.110
specifically designed for debugging. We say yes. And as you

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.750
see here, it shows us, it's like a different, set of

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.310
views, so we can see the code down here with an

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.100
indication of where the execution is. And of course the execution

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.610
stopped at the break point, which is exactly where

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.850
we told the debugger to stop. So let's look at

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.400
some of the other views in this perspective. The view

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.370
here on the right-hand side, for example, shows the variables

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.720
in scope and the break points that are currently active

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.240
for the debugging session. This is where the editor is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.710
at. The outline of the program and the console at

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.520
the bottom. So now let's execute one line by clicking

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.400
on the Step Over button here at the top, and this will

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.150
execute the line that is currently highlighted and therefore it will move to

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.500
the next line. And as you can see, one nice feature is that

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.760
if I move the mouse over a variable, I can see the value

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.710
of the variable. And the same thing I can do if I look

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.690
at the variables windows here on the right. If I click it, it

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.960
will tell me what is the value of the variable, and in case

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.410
of more complex variables you can even expand it and get more details.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.870
So now let's step over another line by clicking again this button,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.180
and as you can see now we get to the line that

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.410
is actually performing the sum, supposedly, so now let's do the same

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.100
thing that we did before, and let's mouse over b, and we can

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.150
see that the value of b is five, as expected. So now

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.080
let's step over this line as well, and execute the actual sum. And

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.730
doing the mouseover thing, we can see that the value of sum

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.000
is ten, which is not right, of course. In fact, if we check

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.590
a gain we can see that value of A is two. The

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.130
value of B is five and therefore it's clear that there's something

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.780
wrong going on here, and at this point we can notice that

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.030
here we are doing multiplication instead

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.010
of addition. And therefore that's what the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.260
error is. And this is clearly a very simple case. Right? A

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.440
case in which probably you just needed to look at the code and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.150
you didn't need the debugger. But you probably got the idea right?

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.055
So this can be extremely useful when you're debugging, when you're studying more

00:02:58.055 --> 00:03:01.533
complex programs. If you want to stop the debugger because you're

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:04.557
done with your debugging session as in this case, you can

00:03:04.557 --> 00:03:07.518
either click here on the Terminate button or you can also

00:03:07.518 --> 00:03:11.109
just simply tell the debugger to continue the execution, to resume

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.140
the execution until the program terminates naturally. So, in this case,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.520
we're going to click here just to show what happens. And what

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.230
happens is that, you know, the execution will just continue until

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.690
the program exits. So now let's say that we want to fix

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.740
this problem that we just discovered. So we replace the multiplication

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.600
with an addition, we save the program, and we execute the

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.860
program again by clicking on this button. And at this point,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.320
unsurprisingly, we get the right result as shown in the console.
