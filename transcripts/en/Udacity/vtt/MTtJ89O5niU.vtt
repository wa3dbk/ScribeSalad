00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.980
If you type a command and you don't
get it right, or if you just want to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.510
recall something that you've used
before, try using the up arrow key.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.640
The shell keeps a history of
commands that you've run so

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.340
you can walk back through
them using the arrow keys.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.460
Then you can edit a previous
command line that you've used and

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.160
maybe get some more success.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.140
There are a couple of other ways
to access the shell history.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.680
One of them you've seen
is the command history,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.480
which prints out the whole history.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.740
This doesn't just include history
from the current shell session,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.350
you can also see commands
you ran in the past.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.300
Another one is the keystroke control R.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.475
This is a special function,

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:42.615
called reverse i search, which let's
you search your shell history.

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:47.175
This is awfully handy if you used some
command long ago or just yesterday and

00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:50.495
it's long command and
you want to recall it now.

00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:52.325
Oh, that was that command we ran.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:52.825
Great.
