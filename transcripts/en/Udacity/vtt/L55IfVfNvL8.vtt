00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, so more SQL.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's start with the basic statement we've been using so far--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Select * From Links.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's add a Where clause where votes are &gt; 10.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
That gives us only the links that have a few votes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And let's add a new type of clause.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is the Order By clause,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and this says to sort the results.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I've got Select * From Links--we're familiar with that--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
where Votes is &gt; 10--and we're familiar with that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Additionally, all of those rows that you're returning to us,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
order them by the number of votes.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And by default, the votes are in ascending order,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but if you can't remember that,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
it's perfectly fine to specify.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You can say ASC for ascending

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
or DESC for descending.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I usually specify because I can never remember which is default.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Pretty simple statement.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
One other thing to note is that the Where clause is not required.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's never required.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So I could change this to look like this.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Just Select * From Links, Order by Votes Descending.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That would give me all of the links sorted descending by votes

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
with no constraints whatsoever.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Okay, here's a quiz.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We're in the same file, and we're still manipulating our query function.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And what I'd like you to do this time is make the function query,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
return the IDs of the links that were submitted by user 62443,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and sort them by submission time ascending.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And remember that a submission time

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
is the column called Submitted_Time.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Okay, good luck.
