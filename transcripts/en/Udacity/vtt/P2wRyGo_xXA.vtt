00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.920
Okay, so here we are, back at the code. For now, what

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.689
I will do is, continue to draw the square, but I will comment

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.880
the rest of the code out. So, let me go ahead and do

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.570
that. Let me quickly save, and run to make sure everything's running well.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.710
All right, the program still seems to be drawing a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.390
square, which is good. Now, if you remember the original challenge,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.720
It was to draw a circle, out of squares. And thus

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.170
far, all you've done is just draw, just the one square.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.310
So, given that, here's a question for you. How would you've

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.020
build on the code that we've written thus far, to draw

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.800
this image. Now, don't worry about writing code right now. All

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.140
I want you to do, is identify in plain simple English,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.710
the steps you would take to solve this problem. You can submit your answers on

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.160
the discussion forum. Once you're done, make

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.860
sure you check this box before you continue.
