As great as those points we found are, I'd still like for us to find the

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.230
equation of f inverse. How about we take this through step-by-step, since this

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.980
is our first time really doing this. We know that we need to start out with

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.190
this equation, the equation for f. As we've seen from graphs and points in

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.840
equations before, we know that to find the inverse, we need to switch x and y

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.330
in our equation. However, we don't even have a y in our equation right now.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.580
Let's get that straight right now. Please replace f of x in this equation with

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.399
y, and then rewrite the equation down here.
