00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.640
All right, I'll just go in order.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.780
I'll start with the three
boxes we see here.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.730
Each box takes up a third of the page.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.030
So I'll set their width to 33%, and
the orders will go up sequentially.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.270
One, two, and three.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.280
On the next row down, the dark green.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.765
And the orange boxes are both
taking up 50% of view port, so

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:27.050
as their widths to 50% and
their orders are four and five.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.790
And lastly there's another element that
takes up the full width of the view

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.560
ports this would be something probably
like a footer on the page, and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.610
because it goes the whole view
port width it has a width of 100%.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.468
And I set its order to
six because it's last.

00:00:40.468 --> 00:00:44.320
You might have decided to give each
element a different order number, and

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.748
that's totally fine, so long as
they're in the right sequential order.

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:53.580
I could have just as easily picked
increasing prime numbers, but

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.760
that would've just been silly.
