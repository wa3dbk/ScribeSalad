00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.839
Let's take a look at this app across

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:06.300
a few devices with different width screens, an iPhone

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.980
at 640 pixels across and a nexus 7 tablet

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.230
in landscape, at double that width 1280 and note

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.210
that it rescales properly on both of these

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.940
devices. Note this takes into account orientation as well.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.300
The default scaling is to available screen width, so

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.600
it will properly adjust when you flip the screen.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.960
There's also a height property on viewport which you could

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.590
use instead of width, to control the scaling based on

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.900
the height, but of course, most designs are built as

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.220
width primary. That is, they're designed to scroll up and down.
