00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.710
It's time to look at
updating our forecast view.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.718
A quick glance at the key lines
gives me a sense of deja vu.

00:00:06.718 --> 00:00:09.679
We've certainly seen
these metrics before.

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.049
Furthermore, the entire Today view is
nearly identical in layout to the top

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.689
half of the detail view, except that it
doesn't have the space views at center,

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.450
our detail view.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.240
The extra vertical space in the app bar
is the same height as our list items.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.800
Because we're somewhat space
constrained, we're using a minimal 8 dp

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.580
of spacing for the area between high and
low temperatures in the daily forecast.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.679
And of course, we see that
the Today view casts a shadow.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.670
The shadow helps create the illusion
that the screen is made up of

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.640
a physical material.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.470
But how do we cast this shadow?

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.190
To make this easier for developers,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.305
Android L adds a new parameter into
our layout language, elevation.

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:55.693
Paraphrasing from our Material guide,
elevation is the aspect of

00:00:55.693 --> 00:00:59.926
the Material Design language that helps
users understand the relative importance

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:03.089
of each element and focus their
attention to the task at hand.

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.830
It combines the familiar and physical
materials with magical properties

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.752
that designers can leverage
to create delightful moments.

00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:14.490
The elevation of a view,
represented by the z property,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.852
determines the visual
appearance of its shadow.

00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:22.080
Views with higher z values cast larger,
softer shadows.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.060
Views with higher z values also
occlude views with lower z values.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.840
However, the z value of view
does not affect the view's size.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.160
Elevation is used for
the static state of a view.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.170
Translation z is used to create
animation such as this one,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.030
where widgets temporarily rise above the
new plane when performing some action.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.700
Note that this video
represents Material's ideals

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.600
rather than the reality of
the Android implementation.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.490
Elevation animations are typically used
to help signify action in response to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.930
user touch.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.971
Setting the elevation parameter
on a view group will cause

00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:59.260
it to cast a shadow on other views.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.370
You have to be a bit careful as it
also changes the way views clip.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.305
Higher elevation views
will occlude other views,

00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:08.633
even if they appear first in the layout.

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:11.494
The appbar_elevation
dimension is four dp.

00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:15.659
We can add this to our dimensions or
just include the Android design library,

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.950
which defines this dimension.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.410
To make the changes to our
portrait forecast view,

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.890
we need to make changes in three places.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.990
First, we'll update
the toolbar section to create

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.410
the app bar from the design
in activity_main.xml.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.120
We'll make changes to the Today view
in the list_item_forecast_today layout.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.960
And we'll modify the rest of
the forecast list items in

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.730
the list_item_forecast layout.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.360
Before you start coding, you'll grab
another code update, which includes

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.270
correctly sized images, updated list
selectors, and some useful dimensions.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.780
Because we have network
loadable image sets,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.410
you want to constrain the width of
our icon images in the forecast list

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.820
to 40 dps in the list icon
dimension we give to you.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.690
You can use the touch_selector_white
to replace the Today touch selector.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.102
The large numbers are 32 dp,
while the text view is 49 dp wide.

00:03:07.102 --> 00:03:11.918
I'm intentionally using dp instead of sp
here because I don't want these numbers

00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:15.217
to change size when the system
font is set to large size.

00:03:15.217 --> 00:03:19.895
I'm intentionally using dp instead of sp
here because I don't want these numbers

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:23.290
to change size when the system
font is set to large size.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.410
We're pretty tight on space
on narrow devices already.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.250
The app bar is pretty simple.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.390
We take advantage of the fact that the
Toolbar will center its children with

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.940
respect to the entire layout if we use
layout gravity equals center horizontal.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.895
Therefore, we include the Imageview
inside of the toolbar with a height of

00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:43.224
listPreferredItemHeight and
a marginTop of actionBarSize,

00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:46.820
while having wrap_content for
width to let the Toolbar center it.
