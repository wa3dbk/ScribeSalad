00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.620
So the Vanilla RC is what is called

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.750
the eager release consistent memory model and the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.310
new memory model is called LRC, or Lazy

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.590
release consistent memory model. Let's see the pros

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.970
and cons of LRC with respect to Vanilla RC, or Lazy RC with respect to Eager

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.940
RC. So what I am showing you here

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.840
are timelines of processor actions on three different processors,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.400
P1, P2, and P3. And this picture is showing you what happens in the Eager

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.780
version of the RC model, in terms

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.210
of communication among the processors. So when processor

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.630
P1 has completed its critical section, does

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.450
the release operation, at the release point what

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.870
we're going to do is all the changes that we made, in this example I'm showing

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.800
you to make it simple I'm showing you that

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.990
in this critical section that I wrote in this

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.619
variable x, so the changes to x is going

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.840
to be communicated to all the processors, P2 and P3.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.220
It could be, depending on whether it is an

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.910
invalidation based protocol or an update based protocol, what

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.760
we are saying is we are communicating the coherence

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.150
action to all the other processors. That's what these arrows

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.690
are indicating. Now then P2 acquires the lock,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.500
and after it acquires the lock it does its

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.270
own critical section. Again, let's say we're writing

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.160
to the same variable X, and it releases the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.350
lock. And at the point of release once

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.630
again we broadcast the changes that we made. Notice

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.970
what is going on. P1 makes modifications, broadcasts

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.080
it to everybody. But who really needs it? Well,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.960
only P2 needs it. But unfortunately the RC memory

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.920
model is Eager, and it says I'm going to

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.680
tell everybody that has a copy of X that

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.490
I have modified X. And so it's going to tell

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.878
it to P2. It's going to tell it to

00:01:54.878 --> 00:01:58.930
P3 as well. P3 doesn't care, because it's not using

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.660
that variable yet, and P2 cares, and it of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.090
course is using that. But when it releases its critical

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.625
section, it's once again going to do exactly

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:11.290
the same thing that happened over here, and that

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.825
is it's going to broadcast the changes it made

00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:16.880
to shared memory locations to all the other processes,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.243
in this case P1 and P2. And then,

00:02:19.243 --> 00:02:23.414
finally, P3 does its acquire, and then reads the

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:27.160
variable. So, all these areas are showing you the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.680
coherence actions that are inherent in the completion of

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.670
shared memory accesses that are happening in the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.320
critical section of programs. Now let's move over to

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.140
the Lazy version. In the Lazy version, what we

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.210
are doing is when we release a lock, we

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.460
are not doing any global communication. We simply

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.770
release a lock. Later on the next process that

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.320
happens to acquire that same lock. The RC memory

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.500
model. The first thing it's going to say is,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.600
oh, you want to get this lock? I have

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.780
to go and make sure that I complete all the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.800
coherence actions that I've associated with that particular lock. In

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.740
this case the previous lock holder had made changes to

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.140
the variable x, so I'm going to pull it from

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.360
this guy and then I can execute my critical section.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.804
And then when P3 executes its critical section, it's going

00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:21.610
to pull it from P2 and complete what it needs

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.220
to do. So, the important thing that you see is

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.600
that there is no broadcast anymore. It's only point-to-point communication

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.990
that's happening between the processors that are passing the lock

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.790
between one to the other. So, in other words, the

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.720
number of arrows that you see are communication events. You

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.640
can see that there's a lot more arrows here. Forget

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.950
about the arrows that I introduced. But the black arrows

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.560
that you see are the arrows that are indicating communications

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.040
commensurate with the coherence actions needed for this

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.220
set of critical section actions. And correspondingly, the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.870
black arrows here are showing the communication actions

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.230
for the same set of critical section actions

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.750
shown in both the top and the bottom

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.700
half of this particular figure. You can see,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.130
there's a lot less communication happening with the

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.540
Lazy model. It's also called a pull model,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.690
because what we're doing is at the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.779
point of acquisition, we're pulling the coherence

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:23.100
actions that need to be completed over here. Whereas, this is the push model in

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.895
the sense that we're pushing all the

00:04:24.895 --> 00:04:27.760
coherence actions to everybody at the point of

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.660
release. Having introduced the Eager and the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.380
Lazy RC models, it's time for a quiz.
