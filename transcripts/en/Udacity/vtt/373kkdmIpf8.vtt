00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.080
There are two other texture mapping methods that can add considerable detail to

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.272
a model. The first is displacement mapping. Here a texture, called a height

00:00:07.272 --> 00:00:11.570
field, is used to change the height of the surface itself at each vertex. In

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.230
other words, each vertex has a u v value. This value is used to retrieve the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.805
height value from the texture. The height value is then used to displace the

00:00:18.805 --> 00:00:22.846
vertex. In other words, move it upward or downward along it's normal. However,

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:25.450
simply displacing the vertices does not change the shading normals of the

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.778
surrounding surface. You would see the bumpiness and the silhouette of the

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:32.107
object, but otherwise the shading would look fairly similar to the original. To

00:00:32.107 --> 00:00:34.836
change the shading normals themselves, another texture is applied to the

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:38.762
surface. This texture is called a normal map, and is considerably different

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:42.616
than other textures we've encountered up to this point. Here's the displacement

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:46.172
map for the model, and here's what the normal map looks like. The grey level of

00:00:46.172 --> 00:00:49.053
this height field shows the amount to displace the vertex, with brighter pixels

00:00:49.053 --> 00:00:53.650
pushing farther above the original surface. The normal map is, in fact, derived

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.120
from this displacement map, and there are tools to create this type of texture.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.240
Each normal in a normal map is found from the differences in the nearby heights

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.482
in the displacement map. You can always tell a normal map by its distinctive

00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:09.774
light blue. The normal map stores an xyz direction vector at each texel. When

00:01:09.774 --> 00:01:14.908
we view this xyz value as an RGB color, we get this type of look. Specifically

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:18.256
the red channel is x, with positive to the right, the green channel is y with

00:01:18.256 --> 00:01:22.914
positive up, and blue is the z axis. This xyz space is relative to the surface

00:01:22.914 --> 00:01:27.297
of the model and is called tangent space. If the normal is not to be changed at

00:01:27.297 --> 00:01:32.344
all, the normal stored is 0, 0, 1, straight at the z axis. A value of 127 in

00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:37.415
this texture means 0. A value of 255 means 1. The light blue then comes from an

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:43.089
x and y value of 0, which gives a red and green channel of 127. The z value is

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:49.125
1, giving a blue channel of 255. So an unchanged normal has an RGB of 127, 127,

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:53.970
255, a light blue. The basic idea is that you're using this normal value to

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.512
change the existing shading normal. The normal in the texture map takes the

00:01:57.512 --> 00:02:00.410
place of the shading normal, and relative to the shading normal's original

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.882
direction. Here's the interesting part. Once you have the normal map, you don't

00:02:04.882 --> 00:02:08.013
have to apply the displacement map. They're separate processes. The

00:02:08.013 --> 00:02:11.444
displacement map moves the vertices. The normal map modifies the shading

00:02:11.444 --> 00:02:14.664
normals. Here we have, from left to right, the unmodified head, the head with

00:02:14.664 --> 00:02:18.748
just normal mapping, and the head with both. While the model with both mappings

00:02:18.748 --> 00:02:21.352
is the most convincing, using just the normal map gives you much of what you

00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:25.658
want but with many less triangles. In fact, artists often first create highly

00:02:25.658 --> 00:02:29.440
detailed geometric models. A program can then bake the normals into a normal

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.560
map. The mesh can then be simplified, saving both processing time and memory

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.390
while retaining much of the detail as the original. Having a surface that is

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.096
smooth but has differing shading normals is not something we usually see in the

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:44.162
real world. In reality, bumps are what cause the surface to change its

00:02:44.162 --> 00:02:47.347
orientation; however, it's fine in computer graphics to have one without the

00:02:47.347 --> 00:02:51.234
other. We've already been using the idea that the shading normal can be

00:02:51.234 --> 00:02:55.510
different than the geometric surface normal. Here we are extending that idea.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.300
Varying the shading normal per texel instead of per vertex.
