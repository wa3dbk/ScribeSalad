00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. So now that we understand all of that,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
it's: a QUIZ!

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Written a little differently than normal, but a quiz, nonetheless.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I would like you to define a variable called (webpage)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that holds a string that causes our lexical analyzer

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to produce exactly these 6 bits of output:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
' This ', ' is ', bold, ' webpage '--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but pay careful attention to the line number offsets.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Notice, for example, that this Left Angle starts on line 2, character 11.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Try it out. Define a variable, (webpage), that holds this string.
