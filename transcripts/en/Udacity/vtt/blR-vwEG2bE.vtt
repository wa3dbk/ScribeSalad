00:00:00.274 --> 00:00:05.328
If we take the car, we travel 4,500 km at 200 km per hour.

00:00:05.328 --> 00:00:07.978
That's going to take 22.5 hours.

00:00:07.978 --> 00:00:16.120
The throughput is 2 people divided by 22.5 hours, which equals about 0.089 people per hour.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.652
For the bus, we're traveling 4,500 km at 50 km per hour,

00:00:20.652 --> 00:00:23.154
and that's going to take us 90 hours to get there.

00:00:23.154 --> 00:00:26.423
However, the throughput is 40 people divided by 90 hours,

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:30.836
and that's going to give us a much better throughput of 0.45 people per hour.

00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:32.732
These two trends aren't necessarily opposed.

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:35.599
Improved latency often leads to improved throughput,

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:39.335
and sometimes improved throughput also leads to improved latency.

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:42.418
But the GP designers are really prioritizing throughput.

00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:44.441
That's really the focus of their efforts.
