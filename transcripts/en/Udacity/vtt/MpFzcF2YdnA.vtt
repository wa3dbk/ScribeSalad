00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.370
The graph of any function of the form f of x equals log base a of x is

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.242
continually increasing on the domain 0 to infinity. And it has a range from

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:17.555
negative infinity to infinity. It has a vertical asymptote of x equals 0, the y

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:21.951
axis. And it passes through the point 1,0.
