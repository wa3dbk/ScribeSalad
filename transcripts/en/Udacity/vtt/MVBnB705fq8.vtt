00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:02.950
David, what do you think
the patient would select next?

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.070
&gt;&gt; So unlike last time,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.850
the first production rule won't fire
because I do perceive a runner on first.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.990
Instead, while I don't
perceive fewer than two outs,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.070
I do perceive a runner on first.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.110
So this production rule will fire, and

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.120
now by goal is to get
the batter out via pitching.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.010
That'll skip the next rule and
come down to here.

00:00:23.072 --> 00:00:25.830
Given that the goal is to pitch and
we have a new batter,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.610
we're going to add some
information to our stake.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.740
So we can actually now, not just keep
track of the game as a whole, but

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.900
we can keep track of this individual
exchange with the batter.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.170
Then the goal is to pitch and
the batter is not yet out, so

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.640
we're going to suggest
the throw-curve-ball-operator.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.360
We then look and
see that the batter bats right handed so

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.320
the next rule doesn't fire.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.210
So at this point, we've only suggest one
operator, the throw-curve-ball-operator.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.120
So we're going to send
that to our motor system.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.940
So the answer will be that
we'll throw a curve ball.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.810
&gt;&gt; That was right, David, thank you.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.800
Let's summarize some of
the things that David noted.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.040
So, based on the contents of the working
memory, some rules get activated.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.790
As these rules get activated,
some consequence get established.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.830
As this consequence get established,
they get written.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.880
Those consequence get written
on the working memory.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.080
So the contents of working
memory are constantly changing.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.940
As the contents of the working memory
change, nodules can get activated.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.070
So there is a constant interaction
between the working memory and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.630
the long term memory.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.270
The contents of the working
memory change quite rapidly.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.910
The contents of the long term
memory change very, very slowly.
