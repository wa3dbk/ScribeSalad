00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.984
For a hyperbola that is not centered at the origin, we can use h comma k as its

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:10.190
center. This actually gives us two equations for hyperbolas. This equation has

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.885
the x squared term coming first. So the parabola will open to the left and to

00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:20.338
the right. H and k will be our center. And the value of a will be how many

00:00:20.338 --> 00:00:24.666
units we move in the x directions. And the value of b will be how many units we

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:29.468
move in the y direction. This allows us to graph our ellipse, and then draw the

00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:34.550
box around it for our rectangle. Other hyperbolas however open up and down.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.948
These hyperbolas start with the y squared term. This term will be positive

00:00:39.948 --> 00:00:44.604
instead of being negative. But notice that h and k have been switched here. H

00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:50.486
is still with x and k is still with y. But k comes first in this equation and h

00:00:50.486 --> 00:00:54.796
comes second. So, you want to keep this mind when finding the center if the

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:59.358
hyperbola opens up and down. The h value will be this value and the k value

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:04.063
will be this one. This might be confusing but you can always remember that

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:08.625
anything associated with the x direction will be with the variable. For

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:13.482
example, the x coordinate of the center will be h. That's with the x. And the

00:01:13.482 --> 00:01:18.530
way we move in the x direction, a will be here. Underneath the x squared term.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.630
Likewise, anything having to do with the y or the y direction will be next to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.734
the y variable. The y coordinate of the center k is here, and the way we move

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:32.504
vertically up and down, the value of b is here. These equations aren't that

00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:36.230
different. And really the things with a squared and b squared work exactly the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.891
same as before. The only difference is that this hyperbola opens left and right

00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:44.859
since the x squared comes first and this parabola opens up and down since the y

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:51.910
squared term comes first and is positive. The other subtle difference is hk.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.711
Here they're in order, h and then k. Here we need to be careful and get the h

00:01:56.711 --> 00:02:00.980
next to the x. And then get the k that's with the y.
