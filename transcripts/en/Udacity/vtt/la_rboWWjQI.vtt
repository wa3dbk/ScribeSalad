00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.540
One of the ways you're most likely to encounter JSON data,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.090
is through the use of a web service. A web service

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.190
is essentially a database that you can access using HTTP requests.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.230
With a web service, you formulate queries as URLs. So I'd

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.465
like to take a look at a simple example using the

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:17.660
musicbrainz.org site. The nice thing about this site is that we

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.040
don't need an API key, so it'll be very easy for

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.130
you to experiment with the code I'm going to give you. Okay,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.790
MusicBrainz is essentially a wiki, but one that

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.400
provides a web service with access to their data.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.690
The type of data that MusicBrainz maintains, is

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.090
metadata on music. So we can ask questions about

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.050
artists, labels, recordings, etcetera. Now the way that

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.330
we query this site, is by constructing a URL

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.780
that has musicbrainz.org as a base, but then specifies

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.550
a particular entity, the type of data we're interested

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.220
in getting back. And we can specify some additional parameters

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.420
that allow us to be specific about exactly what features or

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.120
what meta data we'd like to get back for a given

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.519
entity, say for an artist. Now, one thing that we're going to

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.020
have to do in order to use this site is,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.480
if we want to get specific information about an artist. We

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.390
actually need to know its unique identifier, that is the MusicBrainz's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.570
unique identifier. And this theme of unique identifiers is something that's

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.260
going to come up over and over and over again in

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.150
this course in a variety of different ways. So the first

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.290
thing that we're going to do, is actually use their Search interface

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.340
and we're just going to pass in a query. That includes some, a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.960
search for the artists we're interested in finding some information about.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.200
We're going to process the results that come back from that query in

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.650
order to get the id for that particular artist and then

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.690
we can request information about a specific artist using that id. Now,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.720
unless you think I'm a one-trick pony, we're actually going to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.580
ask for data for a different artist, in this case

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.740
Lucero. So, here's where we're doing our first query. And

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.580
this is going to give us back a results set. Now,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.600
we're going to process that results set in order to get

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.010
back the id for Lucero, the MusicBrainz's id for Lucero. Now,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.840
I'm not going to go into this in too much detail.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.990
But something I want to point out here is that, what's happening

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.330
is, when we issue this query, the response we get back is JSON data. Using the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.770
JSON module in Python, we can read in

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.690
that data and it will simply be translated into

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.250
the appropriate Python objects. Now, a JSON object

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.730
is equivalent to a Python dictionary. So, what we're

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.850
accessing right here is, that Python dictionary and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.320
we're going to access the artists field of that dictionary.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.810
That field happens to have an array as its

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.230
value and I happen to know that the second object

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.760
in that array is the one I'm actually interested

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.360
in, the band Lucero from Memphis, okay. Now we want

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.620
the id for this particular artist. The value of

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.260
an artist is another object. It was a JSON object

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.350
and the results we got back from MusicBrainz in

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.460
our case, because we're working in Python, the JSON module

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.930
has translated it into another Python dictionary. So,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.290
the id field contains the value we're actually interested

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.440
in getting here. Okay, then what we're going to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.720
do is query this side again, this time specifically

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.880
requesting information on this particular id, the id that

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.080
we got back from our first query. Well, I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.362
should say from processing our first query. Alright. So,

00:03:19.362 --> 00:03:21.720
then we're going to issue this second query. We're actually

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.700
going to ask for releases. And you can look above in

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.400
the code here, to see what's going on here. Essentially, what

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.260
I've done is implemented some convenience code that allows us to

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.600
easily pass in the parameters that MusicBrainz is expecting in order

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.440
to get the releases data back. Okay. And then the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.300
rest of this is simply printing out the results. So, let's

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.730
take a look at, what the results look like. So, here's

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.810
the result of having dived into the result set from that

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.790
first query to get the artists we're interested in. Okay, here's the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.330
id we care about. And then, if we look down, a couple

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.680
of things I want to point out here. I've set up this code

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.050
so that each time it makes a request out to this web service,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.790
it prints out the URL, right. Again, remember that URL is how

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.770
we specify our query to a web service. So, at musicbrainz.org, I'm

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.210
specifying that I want to access the web service, version two of the

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.053
web service. I believe at least that's what this two means. And then

00:04:12.053 --> 00:04:15.740
I'm saying the entity I'm interested in is artist, and

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.750
here's the id for that artist. Now, what I want

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.600
you to do is give me back data that's formatted

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.000
as JSON and this particular parameter for MusicBrainz is where we

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.610
specify exactly what metadata we'd like to receive in response.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.160
It's kind of a catch all for everything. If we

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.840
want more than one type of metadata, we simply concatenate

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.120
them together, here. In this case, I'm just interested in releases,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.330
okay? So then what I did in the code was,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.260
I actually processed the response that I got back to

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.990
this query, to pull out the very first release, okay?

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.260
And here is the object in Python that's going to be

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.720
a dictionary. That represents or that stores the data for

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.240
that first release. This happens to be a release entitled 2012-04-20

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.840
Webster Hall, New York. As it turns out, I was

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.170
actually at this show. My wife had surprised me by flying

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.020
in my best friend, who is also a big Lucero

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.850
fan. Okay? So then what I did was, in here, I

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.070
used a list comprehension to process all of the releases,

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.960
and extract just the title for each one of those releases.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.200
And then I'm simply printing them all out here. So

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.950
what I encourage you to do with this code, is take

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.680
a look at all of it, get a sense for how

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.940
it works, and then experiment on your own with some queries.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.570
You can look for different artists, you can use some

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.550
of the conveniences that we've provided. Here to query for different

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.000
types of metadata about a given artist, okay? So just

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.980
play with this part of the code or work with Python

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.640
in the Python interpreter, and just get a sense for

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.990
the data that's here. What I really encourage you to do,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.100
is print out the full results set, dive into exactly what

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.180
type of data is coming back. It's all just hierarchical database

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.090
structure that has objects or arrays nested within other objects

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.150
or arrays. Following this, we'll have a quiz where we

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.020
actually ask you to answer some specific questions, so you

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.180
will have to be able to query this web service correctly.
