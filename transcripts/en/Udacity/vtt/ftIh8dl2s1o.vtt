If you got 19 inches by 10 inches, great work. If you didn't get that answer,

00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:09.580
let's see how we got that answer. First, I know that the width of a rectangle is

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:14.465
9 inches less then its length, so we can write the width, w is equal to 9 inches

00:00:14.477 --> 00:00:19.442
less then its length. So that's going to be l minus 9. The width is 9 inches

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:24.820
less than its length. We also know that the perimeter is 58 inches. We know the

00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:30.685
equation for perimeter is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width, or 2l plus

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:35.964
2w. If we know that w is l minus 9, we can simply replace w in this equation

00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:41.470
with what w equals which is l minus 9. And we know that the perimeter is 58

00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:47.305
inches. So, I have 2l plus 2 times w, but w equals l minus 9, and that equals

00:00:47.317 --> 00:00:53.295
58. Now, I have an equation that I can solve. First, I need to distribute. So, I

00:00:53.307 --> 00:00:59.925
have 2l plus 2l. 2 times negative 9 is negative 18 and that equals 58. Now, I

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:06.974
can combine like terms, 2l plus 2l is 4l, add 18 to both sides, so now, I have

00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:13.837
4l equals 58 plus 18, which is 76. So, 4l equals 76. Divide both sides by 4, and

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:19.141
I get that l equals 19. So, I have that 4l equals 76, I divide both sides by 4,

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.588
which gives me, l equals 19. So, here's one of the dimensions of my rectangle.

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:29.694
19 inches is the length. To get the width, I know the width is equal to the

00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:34.667
length minus 9. So, the width is equal to the length, which is 19, minus 9 which

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.327
gives me 10. So, the dimensions of the rectangle are 19 inches by 10 inches.

00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:41.039
Let's try a ratio problem.
