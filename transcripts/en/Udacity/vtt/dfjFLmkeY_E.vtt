00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.650
So, hopefully we now are setting
all sorts of error states, but

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.820
we aren't using them to help
display anything to the user yet.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.490
Let's change that.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.160
First, we need to add a new utility
method to get the current location

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.170
status, and next, we'll update
the function that changes the string

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.390
displayed in the empty view to use both
the location status and the network

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.680
state, instead of the call we have now,
that only looked at network status.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.610
As I mentioned before, one of the great
advantages of using a shared preference

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.480
to store the status of the location,
is that we can listen for

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.690
changes to shared preferences.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.980
We'll have forecast fragment implement
an onSharedPreferenceChangeListener.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.620
We'll register this listener with
default SharedPreferences in onResume,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.100
and unregister it in onPause.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.880
When the location status changes, our
onSharedPreferenceChangeListener will

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.630
get called, and we can update
the string displayed in the empty view.
