00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.047
Okay, so the next step of the algorithm

00:00:02.047 --> 00:00:05.008
is to the compute the nodes that are 4 hops away,

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.193
and we're going to be able to do this in a similar way.

00:00:07.193 --> 00:00:12.274
Say we are starting with node 0 and we want the node that is 4 hops away from node 0.

00:00:12.274 --> 00:00:17.386
So we know the node that's 2 hops away and then the node that is 2 hops away from node 2 is node 4.

00:00:17.386 --> 00:00:18.858
We'll fill in a 4 here.

00:00:18.858 --> 00:00:20.888
To find the node that is 4 hops away from node 1,

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:23.861
we know the node that's 2 hops away,

00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:26.398
and the node that's 2 hops away from it is node 0 and so on.

00:00:26.398 --> 00:00:29.185
And then we'll do the same thing for the last line here

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:33.150
and find the nodes that are 8 hops away from each of these starting nodes.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.210
And we'll continue this progress as long as the number of hops away

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.883
isn't greater than the number of nodes.

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:40.141
In our example here, for instance, we have 10 nodes,

00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:43.544
so we will compute the nodes that are 1, 2, 4, and 8 hops away,

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:46.911
but if we computed more, we would be going all the way around the list and beyond.

00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:49.921
How much work does it take to compute this entire table

00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:54.877
for N nodes proportional to N, N log N, N-squared, or N-cubed?
