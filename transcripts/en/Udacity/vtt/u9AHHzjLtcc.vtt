00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is the first choice. We'll go through the steps next.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The third choice is clearly useless, since it's still in terms of p and q,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and it's also incorrect.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The second choice would be useful if it was correct, but it's just not correct.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The hint was to try squaring p - q. We get this.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Pq here is equal to n, so we can simplify this to p^2 + q^2 - 2n.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We've still got these terms of p^2 and q^2.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If we want to get an equation all in terms of n, we need to get rid of those.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But we also know was p + q is.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's try squaring that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
When we square p + q, we get p^2 + 2pq + q^2,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
which--substituting the n for pq--is equal to p^2 + q^2 + 2n.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This looks good. If we subtract these two, we get rid of p^2 and q^2.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, remember, our goal is to get an equation that doesn't involve p or q,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but we have this property from the totient that we know was p + q is in terms of just n.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We're going to substitute that in.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Then we can just take the square root,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which is how we ended up with this equation here,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which was the answer to the quiz.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Now we know the value of p + q in terms of an equation only using n.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We could have these two get the value of 2p, divide that by 2,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and get the value of p.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Once we have the value of p, we factor it is, because we can divide n by p

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and easily get the value of q.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So our nice little box here turns into our proof is finished.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I should emphasize that there is no difficult computation to do here.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We're doing subtraction, squaring, and multiplication.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The square root is a discrete square root, but discrete square roots are not difficult.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We know that this result will be an integer, because the value of p must be an integer.
