00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One of the things we'd like able to do is to compute statistics on lists.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Imagine that we've got a set of n nodes and we've got L, which is a list of values--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
one for each of the nodes in the network and we want to compute statistics.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What are statistics? Astatistic is actually quite a simple idea.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's just a number that summarizes a list of numbers.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If we have a list L--say a list of the centrality scores.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There's lots of different statistics that we can imagine that would summarized

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
these list of numbers--for example, how many numbers are in the list.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What's the largest number in the list? What's the total of all the scores in the list?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
How many scores are in the list that are between 2 and 3 inclusive?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
These are all different statistics and some of these are may be more useful than others

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but there's lots of different statistics that we might want to compute.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In general when you're doing an analysis of large structures like social networks,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we need some way of summarizing this large amount of data--you can't just present the data

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in the raw form--it's too much for people to think of all at once.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Statistics and computing statistics ends up being a really important operation.
