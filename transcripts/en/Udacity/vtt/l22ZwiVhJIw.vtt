00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.990
Let's start by giving a few examples

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.860
of how hardware and software interact. An application

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.740
asks for and obtains services from the operating

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.880
system. For example, reading a file that is

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.910
stored on the hard drive. Or clicking the mouse on Google Earth to take you

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.570
virtually to some place. Now let's understand, how

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.690
the hardware architecture and the system software work

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.460
together to serve an app running on the computer system.
