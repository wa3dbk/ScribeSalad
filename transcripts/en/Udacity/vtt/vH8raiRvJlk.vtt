00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.980
So far in this course I've been treating
addresses as if they belong to hosts.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.030
Well, they kind of do, but
it's more accurate to say

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.280
that addresses don't belong to hosts so
much as they belong to interfaces.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.150
A host, like this laptop,
can have multiple network interfaces and

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.370
each interface can have zero or
more addresses.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.870
For example, this laptop might have
a wired Ethernet interface and

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.950
a WiFi interface, and
every machine also has a loop

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.779
back interface which can be used for
talking to itself.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.860
And there are other kinds
of interfaces as well, for

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.150
example you might have a tunnel
to another part of the network.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.570
Or if you bring up a VM on a system,
like Virtual box for instance,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.860
there can be a virtual machine interface
connecting the host operating system and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.020
the guest operating system.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.100
And on Linux you can find out
what interfaces your machine has

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.610
with the command ip addr show.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.560
In this case showing that this
machine has a loopback interface and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.670
eth0 interface, lo and eth0, and
here are their IPv4 addresses.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.440
There are other commands
that can do this as well.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.590
For instance on a Mac or other Unix
system, might use the ifconfig command.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.280
And on Mac OS 10 you'll
find that a system has

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.980
an awful lot of interfaces,
many of which aren't used for

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.730
Internet traffic but for
other things like finding printers.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.490
You can compare the addresses you see
here against your network configuration

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.009
in the GUI to find out what
interface you're actually using.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.380
A little bit more about
that LOOPBACK interface.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.330
The LOOPBACK is a special interface
that almost always has the IP

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.015
address 127.0.0.1 and
the host name localhost and allows

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:59.155
programs to use the network stack to
talk to other programs on the same host.

00:01:59.155 --> 00:02:02.175
Whenever you've made connections
to local host or 127.0.0.1 before,

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:07.175
those are going over
the loopback interface.
