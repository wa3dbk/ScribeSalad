00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.960
Here we are inside the CSS documentation on Bootstrap's website.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.700
Inside the images section, we find something about responsive images.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.590
This is what we want.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.980
We want our images to be responsive-friendly.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.120
It looks like we only need to add the img-responsive class to make sure our

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.120
images are, well, responsive.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.190
Let's see if that works.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.710
Let's go ahead and open up DevTools.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.600
And I'll go ahead and try it out on this image.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.470
Booting it up.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.570
I've got image here.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.900
I'll right-click on it, add attribute.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.940
So we've applied the class img-responsive to this image in particular.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.910
Let's go ahead and resize the page and see if it works.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.060
I will make it smaller, and smaller, and

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.238
smaller until we're about the size of mobile.

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:41.800
And because we've added that responsive image class,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.770
you can see the entire image fitting within the width of this small frame.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.684
So, the correct class is img-responsive.
