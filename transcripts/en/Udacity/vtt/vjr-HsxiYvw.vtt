00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.866
Our previous box factory pipeline had just three stages. Say, we were able to

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:10.532
split each of these stages in half, and each takes 5 seconds. So, instead of 1

00:00:10.532 --> 00:00:15.941
cutter we have 2 cutters, 2 folders and 2 tapers. The time to take a single box

00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:20.159
is still 30 seconds. At what rate do boxes come off this pipeline?
