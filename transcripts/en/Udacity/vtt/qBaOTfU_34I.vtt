If we started with a graph of our super simple equation, y equals x squared,

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:08.125
what do we need to do to shift the graph of this down three units? So, in other

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:12.218
words, what equation would produce a graph that is shifted down 3 from the graph

00:00:12.218 --> 00:00:15.747
of y equals x squared. Fill in the rest of the equation in this box.
