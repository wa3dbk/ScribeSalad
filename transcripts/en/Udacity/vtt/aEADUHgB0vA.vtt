00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.969
I've designed another class, that I call the Simulation class, that puts all

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.958
the information together. It keeps a list of all the cars in the simulation and

00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:11.885
all of the people. I'm giving you a method to read in all of those data, and

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:15.533
that's not the part that I'm most interested right now, so we'll glance right

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:21.156
past it. Now the simulation has two phases. In the first phase one loads all

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:24.756
the passengers into the cars and in the second phase we drive all the cars

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:29.902
until they have arrived. So go ahead and implement this method, what you

00:00:29.902 --> 00:00:33.382
going to have to do is for each passenger you want to find a car that can hold

00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:36.982
it, that means you need a loop over all the cars until one of them says yes,

00:00:36.982 --> 00:00:41.260
this passenger can be added
