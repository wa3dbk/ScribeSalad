00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.480
We'll start with protocol definitions.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.200
Here's a protocol I'm calling Souschef.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.350
Much like a class or struct definition,
it begins with the word protocol,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.650
followed by the protocol name,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.230
and then in between curly braces we
define its properties and methods.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.380
This protocol has no properties and
two methods.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.760
You can see that the methods
aren't implemented here,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.960
that's left up to the conforming type.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.100
Here, we just have a list of method
signatures indicating parameters and

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.640
return types.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.710
The next step is for a class, struct,
or enum to adopt the protocol.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.540
And the code looks like this.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.320
Here, we have a class called Roommate.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.330
We want the Roommate class to
adopt the Souschef protocol, so

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.000
an instance of the Roommate
class can help make dinner.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.200
To adopt the protocol,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.320
we just type a colon after the class
name and then the name of the protocol.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.980
And what does the compiler
have to say here?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.280
Type Roommate does not
conform to protocol Souschef.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.550
This message is letting us know that we
still need to implement the methods in

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.610
the protocol.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.940
Remember, placing the name Souschef here
is akin to the class signing a contract

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.300
to implement the methods listed
by the Souschef protocol.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.570
We still need to fulfill our contract.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.660
So here in the Roommate class, we need
to conform to the Souschef protocol,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.870
meaning we need to write implementations
for the chop and rinse methods.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.160
They will each take in
a vegetable string and

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.470
return a string indicating that their
sous chef duties have been fulfilled.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.360
Soon enough, you'll be writing
protocols for your own custom classes.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.310
Still, more often than not, you'll be
implementing protocols written by Apple.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.930
Let's practice the syntax we
just learned on a protocol from

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.710
the Swift standard library.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.638
This protocol is called Equitable.

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:40.400
We can Cmd+click on the protocol
name to see its definition.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.500
There's a lot of commenting here, but

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.230
the protocol actually
only has this one method.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.650
It takes in two values,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.670
the left-hand side in the right-hand
side of an equality and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.840
returns a bool indicating whether
the two values are equal.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.870
In other words, with this method
in the equitable protocol

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.940
we can define what it takes for
two instances of a class to be equal.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.890
As you just saw, to adopt the protocol,

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.990
we just type equitable
here after the class name.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.050
To conform to the protocol,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.210
we need to implement this function which
is named with just the equal operator.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.110
And we'll say that two
instances of the class Roommate

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.430
are only equal if they have the same
name and the same bool value for hungry.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.910
You'll notice that I've implemented
this function outside of the class.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.810
That's because operators
are global functions.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.800
And now,
we can test whether two instances of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.020
the Roommate class are equal.
