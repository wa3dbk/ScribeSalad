00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.140
Look at this one little
bitty itty Lego piece.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.770
Did someone painstakingly put each
of these little circles on top, or

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.840
take a huge piece of plastic and
chisel it down to this?

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.980
Did someone carefully mix the colors
together to create just this right

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.440
shade of green?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.329
Now think about asking
these same questions for

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.810
every single one of these pieces.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.210
There's no way that each
piece was made by hand.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.110
They used a mold or template.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.750
Using a mold, you can make thousands
of pieces incredibly quickly.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.990
Depending on which mold you use,
you've already determined the size and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.560
shape of the pieces.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.650
One thing that the mold can't
decide though is color.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.050
It's dynamic and is chosen near the end.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.530
So a template gives you a starting point
with a default structure and content.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.570
But just like color,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.200
you might need to provide specific
information before it's usable.
