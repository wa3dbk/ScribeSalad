00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.260
As we said at the outset of

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.660
this course module, virtualizing the memory subsystem in

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.280
a safe and performance conscious manner is the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.570
key to the success of virtualization. What remains

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.770
to be vertualized are the CPU and the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.810
devices. That's what we'll talk about next. Memory

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.990
virtualization is sort of under the covers. When

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.710
it comes to the CPU and the devices,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.930
the interference among the virtual machines living

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.490
on top of the hypervisor becomes much

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.550
more explicit. The challenge in virtualizing the

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.560
CPU and the devices is giving the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.360
illusion to the guest operating systems living

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.810
on top, that they own the resources.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.840
Protected and handed to them by the hypervisor, on a need basis. There are two

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.890
parts to CPU virtualization, we want to give the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.850
illusion to each guest operating system, that it

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.790
owns the CPU, that is; it does not

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.370
even know the existence of other guests on top

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.360
the same CPU If you think about it,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.890
this is not very far removed from the concerns

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.810
of a time shared operating system, which has

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.430
to give the illusion to each running process that

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.470
that process is the only one running

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.360
on the processor. The main difference in the

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.280
virtual setting is that this illusion is

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.290
being provided by the hypervisor at the granularity

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.810
of an entire operating system. That's the first part. The second part is we want

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.510
the hyperviser to field events arising due

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.930
to the execution of a process that belongs

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.550
to a parent guest operating system, in particular during the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.230
execution of a process on the processor. There are going to be

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.510
discontinuities that occur. And those program discontinuities, have to be

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.990
fielded by the hypoviser, and passed to right guest operating system.
