00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.460
And the answer is a few milliseconds. So here's why. We have a 100 years. A year

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.081
is roughly 365. If it is a leap year, it's one more, but we're going to have

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:13.142
somewhere around 36,000 days. A modern processor can do about a billion

00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:17.124
instructions per second, so that's means 1 nano second per instruction. And now,

00:00:17.124 --> 00:00:20.675
these aren't instructions like statements in a Python program. Each statement in

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:23.820
Python program probably involves several instructions for the processor. So

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.360
we're going to estimate that for each time through this loop, we're going to

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.152
need about a 1,000 instructions. And that's the hardest part of this to guess

00:00:31.152 --> 00:00:34.448
and that's a very rough number. That's going to depend on a lot of specifics

00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:37.986
about how we write the Python code. But it's going to be somewhere between a few

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:41.690
100 and say 10,000 instructions if we do it in a sensible way. So we'll estimate

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.958
a 1,000 instructions. So that means we need a 1,000 instructions times 36,000

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:52.266
days, so we need about 36 and a half million instructions total. If we were

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:55.299
executing this as a human, we'd certainly would not want to do this. But for a

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.890
processor, they can do a billion instructions in a second, doing 36 million

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.421
instructions is no big deal. So that's going to be about 36 million nanoseconds,

00:01:04.421 --> 00:01:08.685
which is 36 milliseconds, which is 0.036 seconds.
