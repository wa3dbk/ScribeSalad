00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.440
Let us now consider a third method for
adapting cases.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.010
This method uses heuristics
expressed in the form of rules.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.930
A heuristic is a rule of thumb.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.520
Let's take an example.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.500
Imagine that you went to a new city, and

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.430
you wanted to find out
where the downtown was.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.130
How could you do that?

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.490
A simple heuristic is that
you just look around and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.590
you find where
the tallest buildings are.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.790
At least in North America, the tallest
buildings tend to be in the center,

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.800
in the downtown of the city.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.010
And this heuristic doesn't
work all the time.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.090
Outside North America,
this heuristic sometimes fails.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.750
And that's the point.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.050
A heuristic is a rule of thumb
that works often, but not always.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.140
To see how the heuristic
method works for

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.270
adapting cases, consider our problem.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.160
Imagine that we're at a restaurant and
we need to go back home.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.100
Recall that we just found a solution for
going from the home to the restaurant.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.590
Having found that solution,
having evaluated it and

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.180
executed it,
we stored it as a case in memory.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.150
So now when we have to go back
from the restaurant to the home,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.550
we can retrieve that previous case of
going from home to the restaurant.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.930
Given a new problem and

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.930
a case, how do we adapt the case
to achieve the new problem?

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.440
In this case, we may have a heuristic
which says that to go back

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.210
from where you came originally, you
simple have to flip back all the terms.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.080
This might give us a solution
that is shown here.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.010
Note that this heuristic
may not always work.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.380
It's a rule of thumb.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.200
It works often, but of course,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.380
we know that we cannot reverse
all the turns all the time.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.960
&gt;&gt; So to return to our programming
example, we were doing file input, and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.310
file input is often a very
resource intensive process.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.030
So let's say I'm designing
a new program and for

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.110
this new program,
efficiency is a much bigger concern.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.800
I might have a rule that says when doing
file input, it's more efficient to read

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.170
entire arrays of data at a time instead
of just reading one byte at a time.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.390
The previous case that I'm adapting
might have had file input as 1 byte

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.340
at a time.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.460
But I'm going to use that rule to
adapt the case to read arrays of

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.540
data at a time.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.329
So, in that way,

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.330
that rule has helped me design a file
input method that's more efficient.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.960
&gt;&gt; David,
to generalize on your answer to design.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.500
&gt;&gt; Designers often use heuristics
of the kind that you mentioned.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.890
For example,
if you want to make an artifact lighter,

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.390
try a different material.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.680
It's a heuristic expressed as a rule.
