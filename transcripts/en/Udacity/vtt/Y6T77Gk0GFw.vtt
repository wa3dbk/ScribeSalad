00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.080
These are the 2 bottom numbers from the last video. They're already written in

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:08.128
scientific notation. Let's look at the form. For a number to be in scientific

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.030
notation, the first number has to be a number greater than or equal to 1 and

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:16.210
less than 10. We'll call that number a. Next, we multiply that number by a power

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:20.219
of 10, so we have a times 10 to some exponent. Any number written in this form

00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:24.135
is considered to be in scientific notation Just be sure that this number is

00:00:24.147 --> 00:00:27.775
greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. Usually it's in the form of a

00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:31.670
decimal, but sometimes it won't have the decimal after the numbers, it might

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:32.061
just be 6 times 10 of the negative 30.
