00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.912
This one was kind of tricky, especially with the independent versus dependent

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:08.506
variable. The independent variable is the type of food. The type of food

00:00:08.506 --> 00:00:13.081
influences how much cows eat, which is the dependent variable. The null

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:17.870
hypothesis is that cows will eat similar amounts of food. Whereas the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.650
alternative if you remember from the last lesson is at least two groups will

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.490
significantly differ, in this case that means that cows will eat more or less

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.360
of at least one food over another.
