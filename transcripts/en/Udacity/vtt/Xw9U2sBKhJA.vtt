Now that we've had a lot of practice dealing with complex numbers, let's go back

00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:09.084
to that original problem we were trying to solve or at least a problem of a

00:00:09.084 --> 00:00:13.572
similar form. I want you to find the roots of this equation for a parabola Y

00:00:13.572 --> 00:00:18.158
equals X squared plus 4. Remember that a root is an X value when Y equals 0. If

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:22.838
you get more than one answer, I'd like you to note that you should separate them

00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:23.543
by commas.
