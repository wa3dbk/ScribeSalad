00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.480
Now that we know what
bipartite graphs and

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.580
matching are, let's consider where that
problem of finding a maximum matching

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.100
in a bipartite graph comes up
in real world applications.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.660
Actually, we'll make this a quiz, where
I give you some problem descriptions,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.170
and you tell me which can be cast
as a maximum matching problems,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.480
in bipartite graphs naturally.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.350
Don't worry about whether or
not there's some complicated reduction.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.610
First, consider the compatible
roommate problem.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.360
Here some set of individuals give
a list of habits and preferences, and

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.060
for each pair we decide
if they're compatible.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.900
Then we want to match roommates so

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.150
as to get a maximum number
of compatible roommates.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.450
Next, consider the problem of
assigning taxis to customers, so

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.240
as to minimize the total pick up time.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.280
Imagine that you're a taxi
dispatcher service.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.010
Another application is
assigning professors to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.740
classes that they
are qualified to teach.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.940
Obviously, we hope to offer
all the classes that we want.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.810
And lastly, consider matching
organ donors to patients,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.580
who are likely to be able
to accept the transplant.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.379
Of course we want to be able to do
as many transplants as possible.
