00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What I want you to think about is, imagine that we've got a graph with n nodes and m edges,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and we're going to try to find out whether it's colorable well with k colors

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
by turning it into a big formula like the one I just showed you.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I want to know how many clauses are in the formula, and just to make that a bit more concrete

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a clause is the sort of thing that I got here in parenthesis, it's between the n's.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We have a list of things that are combined and then there's an n and then there's more things

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that are combined and an n, so how many things are being ended together in the formula.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So I want you to figure out an actual expression in terms of k, n and m that will tell you the answer,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but I'll actually ask you to do it for just a concrete example.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So imagine we've got 3 colors, 8 nodes and 20 edges, how many clauses are in the formula

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that result from converting this 3 colorability problem into a satisfiability problem,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and when you have your answer, write it in this box and we'll check it for you.
