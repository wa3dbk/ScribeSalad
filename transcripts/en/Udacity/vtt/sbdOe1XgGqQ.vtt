00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.390
This expression can be written as the log of base a of r times t cubed divided

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.660
by s. Excellent work if you found this log rhythem. We can start by doing the

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.270
division of r and s since we have log of a minus another log of a. We simply

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.717
divide s into r and combine the logarithms together. Now we're going to use the

00:00:22.717 --> 00:00:28.079
power rule to bring this coefficient of 3 up as the exponent for t. So, 3 times

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:34.524
the log of base a of t is equal to log of base a of t cubed. We're adding two

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:39.444
logarithms together that have the same base. So we can just multiply r divided

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:44.509
by s, times t cubed, here. We know t cubed is the same thing as t cubed divided

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:48.608
by 1. So when I multiply these fractions together, I just multiply their

00:00:48.608 --> 00:00:54.055
numerators to get r times t cubed. And we multiply the denominators s and 1 to

00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:56.540
get s. Here's our single logarithm.
