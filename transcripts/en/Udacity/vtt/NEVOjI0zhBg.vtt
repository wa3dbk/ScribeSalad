Here are two more tangents lines. Actually two was one of the three that we had

00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:08.093
in the last quiz. And these two lines are tangent to two points on the curve

00:00:08.093 --> 00:00:12.493
that have the same y value but different x values. My question is how the slopes

00:00:12.493 --> 00:00:17.285
of lines one and, and two compare to one another. Which of these do you think is

00:00:17.285 --> 00:00:22.705
correct? Do you think that m1 and m2 are equal, that m1 equals negative m2, that

00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:27.861
m1 equals negative 1 over m2 or that m1 equals m2 over 2? Remember that m1 is

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:31.119
the slope of line 1 and m2 is the slope of line 2.
