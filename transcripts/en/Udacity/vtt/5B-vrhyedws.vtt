00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.388
Just to recap, when we have any normal distribution, we can standardize it by

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:10.965
first subtracting the mean, shifting it to 0. And then dividing by the standard

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:16.385
deviation, which makes the standard deviation 1. This is called the standard

00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:21.923
normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. So here, the z score

00:00:21.923 --> 00:00:27.470
is going to be negative 1, and two standard deviations away, a negative 2. So

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.580
now, every value in the data set is written in terms of the standard deviations

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.155
it is from the mean.
