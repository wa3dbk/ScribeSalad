00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.450
Congratulations, you made
it through the lesson.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.240
In this lesson,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.850
you learned about different ways
to help finance your business.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.119
Bootstrapping, loans, and

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.350
investors are always to get the money
that you need for your start-up.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.290
By now, you hopefully have a better
understanding of which of these options

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.490
is right for you.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.770
In the next lesson, you'll learn how
to get out there and tell your story.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.320
You'll design the pitch that
you'll use to secure investment,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.850
build your team, and
gain users for your start-up.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.070
It's going to be a combination of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.230
everything you've done thus
far as an entrepreneur.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.880
So, when you're ready,
head over to the next lesson, and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.310
you can start building your pitch.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.810
See you there.
