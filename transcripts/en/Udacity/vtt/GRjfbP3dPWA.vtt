00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.344
Today we will talk about Meta-Reasoning.

00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:06.110
Meta-Reasoning is thinking about
thinking, knowledge about knowledge.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.090
In this case,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.460
the agent does not reasoning about
something outside in the world.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.530
Instead, the agent is
reasoning about itself, but

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.620
its own knowledge,
its own reasoning, its own learning.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.800
As an example, I can ask you what is
President Obama's telephone number?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.623
I'm sure that all of you can
immediately tell me, you don't know.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:27.577
But how do you know,
that you don't know?

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:30.657
We test a little bit about
meta-reasoning when we were talking

00:00:30.657 --> 00:00:33.330
about learning by correcting mistakes.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.180
There, we were interested in
errors in the knowledge base.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.050
In journal, errors can also be
in reasoning or in learning.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.070
We'll start today by talking
about mistakes in reasoning and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.320
learning, in addition to
mistakes in knowledge.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.670
Then we'll talk about knowledge gaps,
not just errors in the knowledge, but

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.170
when some knowledge is actually missing.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.690
Then we'll talk about a very
journal meta-cognitive skill,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.610
which leads to strategy selection and
integration.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.860
And this class, we have talked about
a large number of methods, but

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.360
we haven't yet talked about how
an intelligent agents can put

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.030
multiple methods together to
address a complex problem.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.390
Then we'll discuss meta-meta-reasoning.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.500
Or meta-meta-meta-reasoning,
how far can we go?

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.800
Finally, we'll discuss an example
of meta-reasoning election

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.880
that is sometimes called
goal-based autonomy.
