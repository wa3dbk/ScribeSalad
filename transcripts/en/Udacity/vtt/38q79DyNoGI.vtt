00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.710
if there's one thing that any good meme needs, it is an awesome picture.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.970
If we were doing this in HTML, we could make an image appear on the screen by

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.840
using the img tag and setting a source to something like this fake image.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.790
But we're doing this with canvas, so let's get rid of this line.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.170
So, we'll start by creating a new image, which we'll call image.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.270
because why not?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.910
And we'll set it equal to a new Image object.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.830
Down here, we'll set this source property of the image object to this file,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.130
which I've got saved to my local machine.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.330
This is part of the power of using the canvas to draw on the screen.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.010
We can use a local file as well as any file on the Internet, so

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.150
if you've found a cool image online, you could put that URL right here or

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.180
just use a link to the file on your local machine.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.930
Images in JavaScript get loaded asynchronously,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.610
which means that we need to do work after it's loaded,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.460
so we'll set the onload function on the image object to what we've got here.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.900
In this case we'll console.log Loaded image, and then we'll doSomethingElse.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.460
Let's be a little bit more specific about what we

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.270
want to happen after the image is loaded.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.555
We'll go ahead and grab the ctx again that we created up here and

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:09.770
call the drawImage method on the ctx of the canvas.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.640
Into the drawImage method, we'll pass the image itself along with its

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.480
starting coordinates, x and y, and its width and height, which in this case

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.730
we're setting to the same width and height as the canvas itself inside the DOM.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.670
Let's go ahead and see if this works.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.190
So we've got the file saved over here.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.930
And inside my browser, I'll go ahead and open up this HTML file.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.650
And we can see it's saved right here on my local machine in the same directory

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.210
as that fry_fixed image that we set the source of the image to right here.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.730
So let's go ahead and open it up.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.450
And voilà!

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.820
We see the image appear.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.590
