00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.320
Here's the alternating
trick in some more detail.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.590
Suppose that M1 recognizes L and
M2 recognizes L complement.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.020
We want to decide the language L.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.510
In pseudo code the alternating
strategy might look like this.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.750
In every iteration we
execute both machines,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.690
one more step than we did the last time.

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:23.810
Note that it doesn't matter if we
save the machines' configuration and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.600
start where we left off, or start over.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.420
The question is whether we get
the right answer, not how fast.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.270
The string has to either be an L,
or an L complement.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.270
So one of these has to halt after
some finite number of steps.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.850
And when i hits that value this
program will give the right answer.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.200
Overall then we have
the following theorem.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.600
A language L is decidable if and only if
L and its compliment are recognizable.
