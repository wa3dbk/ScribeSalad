00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.460
David, did you solve this problem?

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.880
&gt;&gt; So just like the original state,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.290
there could be five moves
that come out of this.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.600
Two of the moves we can
already say are illegal.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.440
Moving two guards would have more
prisoners than guards on the left.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.382
And moving one guard and

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:16.190
one prisoner would end up with
too many prisoners on the right.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.400
So we don't include those states.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.680
Then our three legal moves are to
move one prisoner, two prisoners,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.870
or one guard.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.080
But, now I notice that this state is
actually identical to this state.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.030
Like we said before,
once we're in a state,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.820
we don't really care how we got there.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.590
So going back to an earlier
state is not a productive move.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.370
So, we can rule this out
as an unproductive move.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.870
Similarly, this state is
the same as this state.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.560
So we can rule this out as
an unproductive move as well.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.950
That leaves us with only
one legal productive move

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.260
that can follow from the previous state.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.300
&gt;&gt; That is a very good point, David.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.520
So this representation is a good
representation for this problem,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.080
because it is making all the constraints
of the problem solving explicit.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.180
So that we can quickly
compare states and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.410
say, which moves are productive and
moves are not productive?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.280
&gt;&gt; I can tell you that when I tried to
solve this problem on my own, it took me

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.230
a while because I didn't recognize
the fact that I kept going around in

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.890
a circle because I didn't realize I kept
coming back to the exact same state.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.600
&gt;&gt; In fact, David,
most of us have the same difficulty.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.480
So the power of this semantic network
as a representation is arising

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.600
because it allows us to
systematically solve this problem,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.190
because it makes all the constraints,
all the objects, all the relationships,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.660
all the moves, very explicit.
