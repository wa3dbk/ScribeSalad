00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
Say we have a decision problem, and let's call it Problem-X.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.640
Now since it's a decision problem,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.790
the solution to this problem is just either a yes or no answer.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.540
Now let's also say that we have figured out

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.660
a randomized algorithm for this problem,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.450
and we know that the randomized algorithm

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.040
returns the correct decision, yes or no, with a probability of 75 percent.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.610
Now let's say that the randomized algorithm runs in polynomial time

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.299
and that the type of randomization it uses is basically just a coin flip.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.920
So at certain points in the code it just flips a coin,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.340
and decides to continue execution at one of two places at random.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.820
I'd like to know which of the following statements are true.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.520
That the algorithm can be used to produce a correct answer

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.040
with 99 percent probability in polynomial time.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.080
That the algorithm can be modified to always produce a correct solution

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.600
on a nondeterministic RAM in polynomial time.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.200
Rather that it can be modified in the same way

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.810
to produce a correct solution on a deterministic RAM in exponential time.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.160
And finally I'd like to know if Problem-X is in NP

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.940
and also if it's NP-complete.

00:01:10.940 --> 99:59:59.000
So check all that are true statements.
