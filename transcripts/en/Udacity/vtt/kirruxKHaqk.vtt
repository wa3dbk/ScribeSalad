00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.270
So any procedure that we could write recursively. We're going to

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.430
also write without using a recursive definition. And I want to

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.760
show you another way that we might have defined is

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.620
palindrome. So here we're doing this with the for loop,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.340
and we're looping using the variable i and the range

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.200
from 0 to the length of s divided by 2.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.630
So that's going through halfway of s. And inside the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.500
loop we have an if-test that checks if the character

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.740
at position i is different at the position negative i

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.220
plus 1. So that's going to be counting from the back

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.320
of the string, i's positions away. If those are different,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.420
then we've found a mismatch and we return false. If they're

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.900
not different, we're going to keep going through the loop. Once

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.495
we get to the end of the loop without finding any

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:48.380
differences, we know it's a palindrome and we return true.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.510
So this is also another way we could define is palindrome.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.210
I think this is more complicated to understand, and harder to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.210
get right. It took me three tries before this code worked correctly,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.250
whereas the recursive definition, I could get right the first time.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.450
If we wanted to test very long palindromes, this would be much

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.720
more efficient, than the code that we had with the recursive

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.310
definition. And there are a couple of reasons for that. One is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.410
that the recursive definition keeps making new strings, every time we

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.080
do the recursive call, we have to create a new string, and

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.370
that's pretty expensive. Another reason is that the recursive calls

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.230
themselves are fairly expensive, and there are languages that make

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.170
recursive calls fairly cheap. Python is not one of them.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.980
In Python, it's fairly expensive to do a recursive call. So

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.970
for most procedures, the recursive way is often the most

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.570
elegant, and the easiest way to get correct. If we're

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.060
really worried about performance, and we need procedures to work

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.340
on really large inputs. We're often better off trying to find

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.550
a non recursive way of defining that procedure.
