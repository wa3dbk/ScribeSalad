Before looking at additional actions, though, I would like to

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.770
see what is the basic workflow in a version control system

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.370
using the three actions that we just saw. And to

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.760
do that I'm going to use two of our friends, Brad

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.590
and Janet. So we have Janet here, Brad, and a

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.440
VCS that they are using. Now imagine that Janet creates a

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.020
file called foo.txt and puts some information in the file.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.250
At that point she might want to add the file to

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.340
the repository and to commit it so that her changes

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.210
and the file get to the central repository. And when she

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.900
adds and commit, that's exactly what will happen, in foo

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.870
will be come available here, and will be accessible to the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.330
other users. In this case it'll be accessible to Brad.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.190
If Brett were to run an update command, what will happen

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.800
is that the file foo.txt will be copied on the local

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.460
work space of Brad and Brad will be able to access

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.980
the file. At this point Brad might want to modify

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.110
the file, for example add something to this existing file.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.410
After doing that, he also may want to share the

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.900
updated file with Janet. To do that, he will commit the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.070
file and the result will be exactly the same of

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.470
when Janet committed her file. That the updated file will

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.890
be sent to the repository and the repository will store

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.570
that information and make it available for other users. So now,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.290
if Janet performs an update, she will get the

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.860
new version of foo.txt with the additional information that was

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.950
added by Brad. And we will see all of this

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.350
in action in our next demo in a few minutes.
