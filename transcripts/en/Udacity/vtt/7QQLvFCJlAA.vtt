00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.630
So let's look at how
the processor sees the memory.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.050
The processor sees what we call,
physical memory, which is the memory

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.240
contained in the actual memory modules,
that we bought and put in the system.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.140
The amount of that memory sometimes,
even lower, than 4GB.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.130
It is almost never 4GB per process that
we have in the system, because there

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.490
can be tens or even hundreds of
processes in a modern operating system.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.080
And it is never 16 exabytes per process.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.540
This is how much memory we need, if we
have 2 to the 64th memory locations,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.150
which is what you would
have with a 64-bit address.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.030
So if each process in a 64-bit machine
thinks it has this much memory,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.910
there is just no way we can have
enough actual memory for that.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.680
So we conclude that the amount
of physical memory we have

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.880
is usually less than what
all the programs can access.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.000
If all the programs access all
the memory they possibly can,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.910
they will access much, much more
than the memory we actually have.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.490
The addresses that the processor
uses for the physical memory

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.340
have a one to one mapping to the bytes
or words in the physical memory.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.980
So a given address always goes
to the same physical location.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.070
And the physical location always
has exactly one physical address.
