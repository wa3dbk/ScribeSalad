00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.280
There are two fundamentally
different ways to create and

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.500
store images and this affects how
you deploy images responsibly.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.040
Raster and vector.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.050
Raster images, photographs and

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.040
other images represented as a grid
of individual dots of color.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.500
Raster images might
come from a camera or

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.520
a scanner, or
be created with the HTML canvas element.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.620
Vector images, images such as logos and
line art, which can be defined

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.020
as a set of curves, lines, shapes,
fill colors and gradients.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.790
Vector images can be created with
programs like Adobe Illustrator or

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.290
Inkscape, or
from using a vector format such as SVG.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.560
SVG makes it possible to include
responsive vector graphics in a web

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.520
page, and
we'll talk more about this format later.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.710
The advantage of vector file formats
over raster file formats is that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.000
the browser can render
a vector image at any size.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.030
After all, vector formats describe
the geometry of the image.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.830
How it's constructed from lines,
curves, and colors and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.920
so on, not individual dots of color.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.340
Let's see what happens
when we resize this page.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.100
Now, that's an SVG image on
the right and a PNG on the left, and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.720
you can see as the size increases, the
PNG is looking to start a little blurry,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.450
whereas the SVG is perfect at any size.
