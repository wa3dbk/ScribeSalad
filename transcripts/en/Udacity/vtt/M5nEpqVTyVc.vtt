00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.695
Because Grids doesn't need the full power of web audio, we want to create a

00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:08.820
wrapper to hide all the potential complexity. What we really want is a simple

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.372
node graph consisting of the gain node that adjusts the volume. We want to keep

00:00:14.372 --> 00:00:18.337
track of that, the audio context, and all the sound effects that are currently

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:23.610
playing. Can you try to fill out the provided sound manager class with that

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.170
functionality? It should only be about three or four lines of code.
