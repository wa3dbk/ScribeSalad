It's bad to try and cram for a test, remember a shopping list, or learn

00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:09.742
something new when you're really stressed. Because cortisol affects the brain

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:15.210
by inhibiting plasticity and damages dendrites, which interferes with memory.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.682
So, you won't be able to remember what you studied for the test, or what's on

00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:22.640
the shopping list, or the new things that you learned.
