00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.870
Remember our previous lesson about
making sure elements appear in the DOM

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.400
in a way that makes sense for
the tab order?

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.880
Well, what do you do when you have
content which isn't on screen yet, but

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.310
still needs to be in the DOM?

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.270
A good example of this is
a responsive drawer panel.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.950
Now this is a really
common UI pattern and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.850
it can present an interesting
challenge for accessibility.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.600
To illustrate this, here is the desktop
version of that same site and

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.010
I want you to notice what
happens as I press the tab key.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.020
Focus will start off
up here in the corner.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.240
It will then move to this input,
this button, and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.040
then it's just going to disappear.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.210
Now, I'm still pressing the tab key,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.390
in fact I pressed it a few times now,
but we're not seeing anything.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.830
Wait, our focus just
appeared right down here.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.960
So, what happened there?

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.490
Why did it disappear?

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.410
Well, you might see where
I'm going with this.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.830
That whole time that
focus was off screen.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.170
It was actually hiding inside of
this drawer panel going through and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.010
focusing all of these individual links.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.510
Well this isn't really
a great situation to be in,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.110
and when you're building an application
you might occasionally find that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.980
as you're tabbing around focus
seems to suddenly just disappear.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.530
To figure out what's going on, you may
need to do a bit of detective work.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.180
If you're tapping around and
you notice focus suddenly disappears,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.970
you can go into your console and
log the document active element.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.670
So I'll do that right now.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.370
I'll start by focusing
my hamburger menu again.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.670
I'll move through to the input button.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.610
And once focus disappears,
I'll go down in my console and

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.860
log document active element.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.730
Active element gives you a reference
to the currently focused item,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.980
which in this case looks like
some kind of fancy button.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.850
So you can go and look for our fancy
button here in our source code and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.050
make sure that it's not focusable.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.600
But another option to
do our detective work

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.430
is to use the chrome accessibility
Dev tools extension.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.410
The Dev tools extension adds
a number of useful features,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.690
including an inspector which will
show you the accessibility properties

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.259
of an element, as well as
a set of accessibility audits.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.110
You can find these by
opening the Dev tools and

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.500
going to the Audits section,
located right here.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.410
Here, I've unchecked everything except
for the Accessibility audit itself.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.880
And I'm going to run it against
the present state of my page.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.160
When I do this, you'll see that
it produces a number of errors.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.560
Including items that are focusable,
but either invisible or

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.470
obscured by another element.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.030
And looking at that list,
we can see our fancy button and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.700
all of the other anchor tags
inside of that off screen menu.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.460
To fix the drawer menu, one option would
be to set it to either display none or

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.340
visibility hidden using CSS
whenever it's off screen.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.330
This will prevent focus from being
able to move into that element and

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.400
focusing any of the child
links inside of it.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.480
And then when the element
comes back on screen, or

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.770
just before it's about
to animate on screen,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.470
we can set it back to display:block or
set the visibility back to visible.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.930
Now in the next section, we'll have
you do some sleuthing of your own

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.730
using these tools to find some off
screen content and then to fix it.
