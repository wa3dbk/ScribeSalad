00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.720
We're almost done with the proof
that satisfiability is NP complete.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.047
But before making the final arguments,

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:08.360
I want to remind you
what we're trying to do.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.280
Consider some language in NP, and
suppose that someone wants to be able to

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.000
determine whether strings
are in this language.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.548
The Cook-Levin theorem argues
that because L is in NP,

00:00:17.548 --> 00:00:21.390
there's a non-deterministic
turn machine that decides it.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.141
And it uses this fact to create
a function computable in polynomial time

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:28.594
that takes in any input string X, and

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:31.853
outputs a boolean formula
that is satisfiable.

00:00:31.853 --> 00:00:34.850
If and only if,
the string X is in the language L.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.400
That way, any polynomial algorithm for
deciding satisfiability

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.710
will be able to decide every
language in NP in polynomial time.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.510
Only two questions remain.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.030
Is the reduction correct, and is it
polynomial in the size of the input?

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.070
Let's consider correctness first.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.710
If X is in the language, then clearly
the output formula is satisfiable.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.730
We can just use the truth assignment
that corresponds to an accepting

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.780
computation of the non-deterministic
turning machine that accepts X,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.110
that will satisfy the formula F.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.340
That much is certainly true.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670
How about the other direction?

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.610
Does the formula being satisfiable
imply that X is in the language?

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.370
Take some satisfying assignment for F.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.890
As we've argued, the corresponding
tableax is well-defined.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.620
Only one of the state variables
can be true at any time, etc.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.750
The Tableax also starts in
the initial configuration.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.810
Every transition is valid, and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.460
the configuration sequence
ends in an accepting state.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.726
That's all that's needed for

00:01:34.726 --> 00:01:36.679
a non-deterministic
turn machine to accept.

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.684
So yes, this direction is true as well.

00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:45.910
Now we have to argue that
the reduction is polynomial.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.950
First, I claim that the running time is
polynomial in the output formula length.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.690
There just isn't much
calculation to be done besides

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.690
iterating over the combination of steps,
head positions, states and tate symbols,

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.300
and printing out the associated
terms of the formula.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.290
Second, I claim that the output formula
is polynomial in the input length.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.040
Let's go back and count.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.586
These clauses, pertaining to the states,

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:13.220
require order p of n times
log n string length.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.530
The number of states to the machine
is a constant in this context.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.565
The p factor comes from the number
of steps of the machine.

00:02:21.565 --> 00:02:24.225
The four i here.

00:02:24.225 --> 00:02:27.809
The log in factor comes from the fact
that we have to distinguish the literals

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:29.590
from one another.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.610
This requires log in bits.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.350
In fact, in all these calculations,
that's where the log factor comes from.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.800
For the head position, we have order
p of nq to log n string length.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.920
One factor p comes from
the number of steps, and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.910
we have two coming from all
pairs of head positions.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.020
They're order p squared
combinations of steps and squares.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.800
So this family of clauses requires
order p squared log n length as well.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.940
The size of the alphabet is
a constant in this context.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.363
As for the constraints pertaining
to the initial configuration,

00:03:05.363 --> 00:03:08.000
this require order p
log n string length.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.610
The dominant factor
being the constraints

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.320
about the contents of the tape.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.150
And the constraint that the computation
be accepting requires only log n string

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.160
length, since it just has to write out
this single literal one clause here.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.810
The transition clauses might
seem like they would require

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.250
a high order polynomial of symbols.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.220
But remember that the size of
the non-deterministic turning machine

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.350
is a constant in this context.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.590
Therefore, the fact that we might
have to write out clauses for

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.789
all pairs of state and tape symbols,
doesn't affect asymptotic analysis.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.670
Only the range of the indices i and j
depend on the size of the input string.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.506
So we end up with order p
squared log n string length for

00:03:50.506 --> 00:03:52.840
all these transition clauses.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.642
Summing the length of all
those clauses up together,

00:03:55.642 --> 00:03:58.953
we have a sum of polynomials,
which is of course a polynomial.

00:03:58.953 --> 00:04:03.320
So yes, the overall reduction is a
polynomial and Cooks theorem is proved.
