00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.150
So far, you've used the APIs Explorer to investigate and test the functions in

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.601
your applications. You've got the getProfile, the

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:13.845
safeProfile. However, Conference Center application includes a full

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:20.880
web UI. Each of the pages in the web UI, send calls to the endpoints

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.800
API on the back end. As you implement the back end functionality, the web pages

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.540
in the app will start to work. Right now,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.070
they don't all work. For example, if you go to

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.340
Show Conferences, it's not going to find any conferences.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.390
It's because the implementation, because you haven't written the code

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.200
to find conferences. But in this lesson we implemented

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.010
the code to get and set profiles. So the My

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.240
Profile page now works. So let's see what happens,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.451
if I change my profile. Let me change my t-shirt

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:56.970
size to, very small, extra small. Change

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.080
my display name to Jocelyn B. I'll Update my profile. And

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.480
the profile has been updated, excellent. When I click the Update Profile

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.920
button, what happens is that this web page in behind the scenes is sending a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.950
call off to the saveProfile endpoint function

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.570
that you just implemented. The goal of this

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.210
course is to help you learn how to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.540
develop App Engine applications, not to teach you JavaScript.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.590
However, I do want to point out the code

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.620
that makes the call to getProfile and to saveProfile.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.470
So, now here we are in Eclipse. And you'll find the code for the webpages or the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.140
web UI under SRC, Web app, and you'll see

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.246
there's the CSS folder, the fonts folder, the IMG,

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:44.935
there's index.html, and there's a JavaScript folder

00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:48.280
JS. And then there's this thing called partials,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.342
which is the HTML pages. What I want to look at first is controllers.js, because

00:01:54.342 --> 00:01:56.233
this has the code that calls the

00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:00.140
getProfile and the saveProfile methods. So let's look

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.280
at getProfile. So here's the code that

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.330
send the call to the getProfile endpoint function.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.750
And you see here, it's gapi.client to

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.250
invoke the client library. And then, conference

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.840
is the name of the API. And then, getProfile is the method name. And again,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:28.740
we execute. And then, here's the code to call when the request is successfully

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.060
executed. And in this case, you can see that the code's just right here in line.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.380
It's not in a separate function. That this is the callback to call when the call

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.050
to getProfile succeeds. Let's look at saveProfile. I'll search for it.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.868
And here it is. And again, I just wanted to point out, here's the call to

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:57.350
gapi.client, or gapi.client. And then conference is the name of the endpoints.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.370
Then saveProfile is the method to call. And in this case we're

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.320
passing at one argument. And then we call the execute, to execute the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.990
request. And again, here's the call. Here's. The code to

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.944
execute in the call back that's called, when saveProfile

00:03:15.944 --> 00:03:21.610
completes successfully. If saveProfile completes successfully.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.410
So that's all I really wanted to point out here. I'm not going to go into the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.420
rest of the UI code in detail. I just wanted to show you the hook where the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.430
JavaScript issues the call to the endpoint functions.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.000
As you go through the course, you're going to be

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.840
implementing the endpoint functions. And I wanted you

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.010
to know how they get called from the UI.
