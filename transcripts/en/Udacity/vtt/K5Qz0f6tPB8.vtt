00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.226
If n is 123, count will end up as 3, which would be correct. There are three

00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:09.280
digits. If n is 100, count will end up as 2, which is not the correct number of

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.850
digits. The loop condition should actually be. While temp is greater than or

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.146
equal to 10. We can see this by hand tracing the code. The values I'm

00:00:20.146 --> 00:00:26.164
interested in are count and temp. If n starts out as 123, then count will start

00:00:26.164 --> 00:00:33.470
as 1, temp will start as 123. Temp is greater than 10, so we increment count.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.705
And divide temp by 10 and divide temp by 10.0 which will give us 12.3. Now, we

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:45.976
go back to the loop condition. Temp is still greater then 10 so we increment

00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:51.930
the count and then divide temp by 10.0 again so we have 1.23. Now, when we

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.830
check again, temp is less than 10. So we skip to the end, and we're done. But

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:02.100
what would happen if n was 100? Count would start as 1, the way it did before.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.608
And temp would start as 100. Temp is greater than 10, so we would increment

00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:13.950
count and then divide temp by 10.0. So we would have 10. And then check the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.940
condition again. But this time, 10 is not greater than 10. It's equal, so it

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.860
skips out immediately. When in fact, we still had two digits left. We needed to

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.665
increment count again. This is why the condition should be temp is greater than

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:30.187
or equal to 10.
