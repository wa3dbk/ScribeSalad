That last refactoring made our code much better, now when we remove a friend,

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:08.115
we can be sure we are removing the right friend. Next you're going to implement

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:11.355
the unfriend method but first I want to tell you a secret, classes can have

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.811
secret methods, here is an example, this private helper method can't be seen

00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:18.051
outside of the person class, they are only used inside to help with other

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:24.340
methods. This one searches for a friend and returns its index. If it doesn't

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.047
find the friend, it returns minus 1. You should implement the unfriend method

00:00:28.047 --> 00:00:30.560
and you can use find in your implementation.
