00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.070
So now that we have seen what ILP is, and

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.600
also how it relates to IPC, we can have a little discussion about the ILP and

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.190
the IPC. We have defined our ILP as basically the IPC on an ideal [UNKNOWN] for

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.239
the processor that has perfect branch branch fiction, enough resources for

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.790
everything, et cetera. And we've saw that, ILP is larger than or

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.430
equal to the IPC that can be achieved on any real processor. So

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.280
if we consider a narrow issue in-order processor, narrow issue meaning that it

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.020
can only issue about maybe one, two, maybe three instructions per cycle and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.200
it's in-order. Usually, the limitation for the IPC will be this.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.830
Basically the in-order property now is going to hurt us too much. So

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.220
this processor is going to be limited mostly by the narrow issue. However,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.050
if we have a wide issue in-order processor, meaning it can do more instructions

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.150
per cycle. It's going to be limited mostly by, the in-order property.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.200
Because this is going to allow you to do a lot of instructions per cycle, and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.760
if it can do closely to what the ILP already is for the application,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.600
then basically we're already kind of close to ideal as far as the IPC is

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.370
concerned for, for the wide issue problem. But because of the in-order property,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.890
we just cannot find those instructions to keep our wide issue slots busy.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.750
So if we have a wide issue processor, we also need for it to be out of order, so

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.990
that it can benefit from the wider issue by finding instructions anywhere where

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.750
they are and not basically stopping on the first dependence. So such a processor

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.620
will need to, fetch execute et cetera, more than one instruction per cycle,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.890
preferably a lot more than 1. So it cannot be just like 2,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.890
it should be 4 maybe or more, that's why we call it wide issue.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.000
It should be able to eliminate false dependencies betw, because if we

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.490
have to obey all sorts of dependencies then that's going to limit our IPC too.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.520
And bring us far away from the ideal ILP. And finally, should be able to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.880
reorder instructions so that we can execute the instructions out of order.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.330
Meaning that, our execution order should be kind of similar to what we did for

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.290
the ILP, and not for what we did for the in order processors.
