00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.930
You're still here.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.260
All right, cool.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.330
Well, if you're wondering
what to do next,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.180
there's a few things I'd
recommend checking out.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.280
All the links are in
the instructor notes below.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.910
If you haven't already, check out
the offline web application course.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.900
It's not just about offline, but

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.550
dives deeper into service workers,
the mechanics of caching and index db.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.100
Even though we use promises in this
course, we didn't cover them at all.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.130
So if you've never seen them before, or
if you're still trying to wrap your head

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.380
around them, check out
the JavaScript Promises course.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.980
We're working on a course for
push notifications right now.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.310
But in the meantime,
we've got a code lab that you can use

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.700
to add push notifications
to your weather app.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.870
There's also the web tooling and

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.700
animation course which will
help you level up your skills.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.930
I learned a few good things
by taking that course.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.700
I'm sure I'm missing something.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.583
So take a look at the instructor
notes for any updates or

00:01:03.583 --> 00:01:08.798
anything new and in a word of
one of my heroes, it's over.

00:01:08.798 --> 00:01:11.799
Go home, go.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.757

00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:18.590
Why are you still here?

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.740
Thanks for sticking with me.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.300
Kind of quiet and lonely in here.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.740
They wouldn't let me have
the little clapper thing.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.560
I wanted that, it was fun.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.534
There was a picture on the back
that was always fun to look at.

00:01:32.534 --> 00:01:35.198
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:35.198 --> 00:01:35.971
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:39.680
[LAUGH] I think we can cut now.
