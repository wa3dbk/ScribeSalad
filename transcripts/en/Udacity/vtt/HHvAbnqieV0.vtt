00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.220
So switching over to Android studio,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.180
we need to do a couple of steps before
we can extract a palette from an image.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.020
The first thing we need to do
in our apps build.grade file

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.515
is to add the support library for
palette as a dependency.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.475
So after we get our resource identifier
for our image, we can convert

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:25.605
that into a Bitmap, that the palette
will use to generate the color swatches.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:28.540
These color swatches fall
into two different areas.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.008
Either a vibrant color or a muted color.

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:37.680
The type in number swatches is dependent
on the composition of your image and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.870
how much of it is in a certain color and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.770
how that contrasts to
other colors in the image.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.600
If you want more information for that,
you can check the source code for

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.150
the palette library.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.970
So right here in this code,
I take a palette and I'm looking through

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.750
all of the different swatches to see if
they exist because they can be null and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.660
then I return that map.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.450
So if we want to see this on a device,
make a little app here

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.010
that can show an image and
pull out the palette information.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.300
So let's hit this floating action
button down here and pick an image,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.580
and let's pick one of the images from

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.990
our Android kick off, and we can see
that it's created a palette for us.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.960
Now, the interesting colors here,
I'd say, is the vibrant color

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.900
that it's picking up from
these Android stickers
