Creating a point light in 3js is simple enough and you can look at the

00:00:03.234 --> 00:00:07.568
documentation page for more details. In this exercise the code is set up so

00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:11.716
that the scene is lit by only ambient lighting. It's quite flat as you can see

00:00:11.716 --> 00:00:14.936
and details lost. What I want you to do is turn off the ambient lighting and

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:18.461
turn on what I call a head light. Think of it as a miner's light, something you

00:00:18.461 --> 00:00:21.961
put on your head to look around in the dark. Instead of a flat ambient light,

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:24.799
you have a light that is guaranteed to illuminate everything you see since it's

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:28.310
located where ever you are. If you search for the word headlight in the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.602
code,you'll see where you need to modify things. There are two things you'll

00:00:31.602 --> 00:00:34.580
need to do. The first is to add the proper type of light to the fill scene

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.972
method. Use the headlight variable which I've declared at the top of the code

00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:41.080
for you. Declaring it at the top makes this variable usable in any of the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.645
methods in the code. Make the headlight a full white color and intensity of

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:49.077
1.0. The second task is to make the light's position always match that of the

00:00:49.077 --> 00:00:53.590
camera for every frame. If you look in the render method you'll see this code.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.650
This method is called every time a new image is to be rendered. Don't worry

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.750
about the delta and the camera control calls. Leave those alone. The key line

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.540
here is the render objects render call. This call is what actually renders the

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.448
scene. What you want to do is to make the headlight's position math the

00:01:06.448 --> 00:01:10.300
camera's position before rendering. By doing so, the headlight will then shine

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.888
on everything visible, bathing it with illumination. The surfaces then are not

00:01:13.888 --> 00:01:17.008
all the same dull solid ambient color, but have some definition to them, which

00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:20.902
looks more realistic. Both the light and the camera are derived from object 3D

00:01:20.902 --> 00:01:24.130
so you can access the position of both of these in the same way.
