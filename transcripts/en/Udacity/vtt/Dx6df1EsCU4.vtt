00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.170
Because these types of applications are so common, a group of technologies

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.330
has evolved to support them. These technologies are called Middleware. That is,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.990
they are technologies between the user or client and the ultimate server.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.420
They essentially are responsible for dealing with satisfying the non-functional

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.090
constraints of the overall distributed system. They're similar,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.510
in concept, to the architectural connectors that we've talked about. It will be

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.845
interesting to contrast those connectors with the kind of middlewares described.

00:00:38.845 --> 00:00:43.260
We'll be using in particular the material taken from the Emmerich paper,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.310
which I've asked you to read.
