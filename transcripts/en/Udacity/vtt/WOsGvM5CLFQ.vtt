00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
And there are several ways to employ randomness in a more intelligent way

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.600
but there is one that is actually quite common.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.150
Let's assume that this here is a huge list of all possible solutions.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.460
So, for NP complete problems or NP hard problems, this will be an exponentially large list,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.110
and the strategy of more intelligent random algorithms,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.590
and we're soon going to see a concrete example for that,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.520
is basically to randomly pick out certain solutions here in this list,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.570
and let's say that the list is ordered in some way, which I'm going to explain in more detail

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.190
when we get to the concrete example, and then, the strategy is

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.840
to explore solutions that lie around the ones that we randomly picked so like this.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.600
So, you would look at all of these solutions here, something like this.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.340
Now, of course, each time the algorithm runs here,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.350
it can only investigate a number of solutions that is polynomial in size,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.510
but of course the list of all potential solutions, so this whole thing here,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.650
has exponential size, and through the way in which you design this algorithm,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.050
well, first of all, you want to ensure that you land in good places so to say,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.730
and this is often, of course, not very trivial to prove how to do that,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.410
and the other thing is that you want to have a good and intelligent

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.640
exploration of the area around your solution

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.220
again something which is of not very easy to prove or show.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520
Actually, we can't expect it to be any other way

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.350
after all we're solving a very challenging namely NP hard or NP complete problem here.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.650
So, just to prepare you a little bit for the realities that you are about to face. Let's do another quiz.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.160
Let's say we have a randomized algorithm for an NP complete problem

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.240
and that algorithm has a fixed error probability.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.440
Let's say the algorithm makes an error with a 90% chance

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.120
and only gives us the correct answer with 10% chance.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.550
So, should we expect that a randomized algorithm for an NP complete problem

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.370
that has a fixed error probability so to say with 90% chance gives us

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.120
the wrong solution and with 10% gives us the correct one?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.070
Should we expect such an algorithm to run in polynomial time?

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.080
And I'll give you three choices, and as always, more than one can be true.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.580
The first choice I'm offering you is no because if we would run that algorithm just a few times

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.850
we would almost be guaranteed a correct solution

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.890
even though this algorithm here that I am asking you about

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.060
makes an error with a 90% chance for each time that we run it

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.830
or if the answer no we should not expect that

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.440
because the number of potential solutions is exponential, and the algorithm,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.940
since it runs in polynomial time, and this of course anthropomorphises a bit

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.100
can only afford to check a small part of that exponential solution space if you will.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.280
And finally, one choice I'm offering you is yes, we should expect that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.920
because the laws of NP completeness

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.070
that we have gotten to know in the past units do not account for randomness.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.440
So, just as these laws don't account for small basis or if we are content with an approximate solution,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.630
it could be that randomness makes such algorithms possible.

00:03:00.630 --> 99:59:59.000
So, please check all of these here that you think are correct.
