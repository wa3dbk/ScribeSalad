00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.810
Welcome to this unit on networking. It covers how

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.090
computers communicate, from the very simple connections in a machine

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.810
cluster, to the architecture of the internet, which makes it

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.610
possible to reach most any willing computer around the world.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.840
We will assume a basic familiarity with technologies and terms,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.590
such as anyone working with or programming computers would acquire

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.780
today. And we'll focus on how all these pieces fit

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.440
together. To make network communication possible and so simple for

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.200
its end users.
