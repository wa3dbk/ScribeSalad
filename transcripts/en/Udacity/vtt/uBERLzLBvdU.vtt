00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.331
Translation is just a way to say move something to a new position. In fact, in

00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:08.166
3JS, we've been using translation for positioning parts of the drinking bird

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:13.132
model. 3JS has translation and other transforms built into every object. In this

00:00:13.132 --> 00:00:18.380
code, we're moving the center of the sphere to the position 0, 540, 0, which is

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.136
a vector, that is any point on the sphere is moved by this vector to a new

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:28.334
position. This code does the same thing, only this line has been changed. It's

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:31.862
pretty obvious that this y-coordinate can be the sum or product of any set of

00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:35.389
numbers. My point here is that adding values together like this is equivalent to

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:40.129
adding the coordinates of the vectors. So here, a vector of 0, 160, 0 and a

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.049
vector of 0, 390, 0 are added together to get 0, 540, 0. Translations can be

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:50.038
treated somewhat like numbers in this respect. You can add them together in any

00:00:50.038 --> 00:00:53.686
order and you'll obtain a final translation vector that sums all the

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:56.323
translations and tells you the final position.
