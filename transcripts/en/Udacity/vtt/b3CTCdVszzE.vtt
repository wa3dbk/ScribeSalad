It kind of feels like our Alice in Wonderland code is done now, but there are a

00:00:03.275 --> 00:00:07.494
few more things we would want to do before presenting or sharing it. Our book

00:00:07.494 --> 00:00:11.772
class has a lot of methods: getNumCharacters, getfirstOccurrenceOfMadHatter,

00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:15.740
getFirstSentence, second sentence, occurrences of Alice, occurrences of

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.888
something else. But in general we called it book, we didn't call it any thing

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:26.056
specific to Alice. We would probably want to fix or generalize, or remove some

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:31.694
of the methods that are overly Alice specific. Which methods should we remove

00:00:31.694 --> 00:00:36.446
or generalize? Write the names of the methods here.
