As I mentioned earlier, the bystander effect has generated much research in the

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.806
area of social psychology, and it continues to do so. Another area of study, of

00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:15.760
pro-social behavior, for psychologists, is the idea of altruism. Altruism is

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.112
selfless attitudes and behaviors towards others, or showing a selfless concern

00:00:20.112 --> 00:00:25.628
for others, and giving aid to them. Now why do you think that people act it

00:00:25.628 --> 00:00:29.019
alturistic ways? Think about it for a moment.
