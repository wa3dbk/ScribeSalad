00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.470
Hi, and welcome to the first of several lessons on tools of the trade. I'm

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.200
very excited about these lessons, because I believe that tools are a cornerstone

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.390
of the software engineering discipline, and it

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.570
is of paramount importance to know and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.330
use them. In this lesson, we will

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.530
talk about integrated development environments, normally called IDEs.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.780
And these are software applications that support developers in many of their

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.870
everyday tasks, such as writing, compiling, and debugging code. And to make the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.470
discussion more concrete we will focus on a specific IDE, Eclipse. We will

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.250
first present Eclipse, and then get some hands-on experience through a demo.
