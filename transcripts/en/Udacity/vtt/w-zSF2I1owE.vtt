00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.350
Again, this is a type of t test. It uses the t distribution and the t table. We

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.670
won't tell you how to calculate the t statistic, we'll just assume that you'll

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.580
use a computer to conduct it. And by now you should be able to know the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.190
interpretation of whatever t statistic comes out for the output. Then you'll

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.090
know when to reject or fail to reject the null. The degrees of freedom are

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.060
important, though. And again that's just like when we did hypothesis testing

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.095
with R. The degrees of freedom are N minus 2. Where N is the number of data

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:38.380
points. So we have N values of X, and N values of Y. For example, let's say

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.670
you're measureing the relationship between two variables, X and Y. And you have

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.820
nine data points. So nine values of X, the independent variable and nine values

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.810
of Y, the dependent variable. And let's say we do a non-directional test at

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.210
alpha equals point zero five. And then let's say that we calculate our T

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.360
statistic and we get five point seven seven. What can we conclude, their is or

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.430
their is not. Enough evidence to reject the null, meaning there does or there

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.399
does not appear to be a significant relationship between X and Y.
