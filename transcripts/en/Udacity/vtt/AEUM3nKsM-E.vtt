00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.422
We're going to use the idea of area to help us understand multiplication and

00:00:04.422 --> 00:00:09.281
multiplying polynomials. If I want to represent the multiplication of 10 times

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:13.407
12, I could set up a rectangle and call the width 10 and the length 12.

00:00:13.407 --> 00:00:18.021
Multiplying 10 and 12 would give me the total area of the square, that would be

00:00:18.021 --> 00:00:22.622
120. This might not seem like a big deal. But we're going to do something pretty

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:27.126
incredible next. We're going to split up 12 into 10 plus 2. I can also set up

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:31.757
another rectangle. The width will be 10, and the length will be 10 plus 2.

00:00:31.757 --> 00:00:36.585
Notice I've created 2 smaller rectangles that make up my larger rectangle. So

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:40.869
what's the area of each of these rectangles? Write your answer here.
