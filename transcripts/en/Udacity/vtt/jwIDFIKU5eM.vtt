00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
So the number of rows is the number of objects and that is 7,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:13.200
and the number of columns is the total sum of all the values, so 2+3+5+4+3+5+2 which is 24.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.450
So, we have 7 rows and 24 columns in this table.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.270
We're going to fill this out row by row, so we start in row 1 then row 2, and so on.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.970
So for row I and column J, what we want in this table is the minimum size required

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.800
to achieve a value of exactly J using the objects 1 to I.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.930
Now in the first row, we only have the first object available,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.380
so the only thing that we can achieve is a value of 2 using size 3.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.890
So, value of 2 using size 3 and all of the other ones are just not possible.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.100
Second row, we have two objects available, we have objects A and B available,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.430
so what we can achieve is a value of 2, a value of 3, and a value of 5.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.990
Now for value of 2, we need size 3 again. For value of 3, we can do that for size 2.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.120
And for value of 5, we need size 5 and I'll put out one more row here for you.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.310
I'm not going to show you the part that goes beyond 8th row

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.750
because that will not be important for what I'm about to explain.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.220
The interesting part here is this one here because object number 3 has size 4 and value 5

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.780
which means that we can achieve value 5 actually by putting in this object

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.700
instead of using A and B as we did in the row before.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.050
Let's go to row 4, because in row 4, I can show you something very interesting.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.150
First value is not that interesting.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.270
So remember that in this row here, row number 4, we now have available to us, object A,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.540
object B, object C, and object D.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.210
If we are to go through the whole table, how efficiently can we fill out this table?

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.250
And now that we have D available here in row number 4,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.160
I can show you something very interesting because you can fill out this table quite efficiently.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.830
Now, here we are in the column labeled 7 which means we want to achieve a value of 7.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.850
How can we achieve a value of 7?

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.270
So you already know that we can achieve a value of 7

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.080
using these three objects, A, B, C because we have this row here.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.220
Now, what are the different possibilities of achieving a value of 7?

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.910
We could either do this through the row above because we know that we can achieve it

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.220
using objects A, B, and C, so it could be row above.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.580
We could also try to take D directly.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.130
That D has a value of 4 so here, that's impossible, so take the new object

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.670
and finally there's only a third possibility here.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.730
Well, since D has a value of 4, we could try to achieve a value of 3

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.170
using the objects we had in there before and then add D to it.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.470
So add D to another set and that is the set of size 3 and we know just from looking at this table here

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.490
that at size 2, we can already achieve a value of 3.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.650
D has a value of 4 and has a size of 5, so 2+5 is 7, which is actually now the same as this one here

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.280
but of course you would be taking the minimum of the required sizes.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.420
So here, we would enter a 7. The interesting part is this.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.700
In order to fill the cell here, we do not need to go through all possible combinations

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.170
of the objects that we have, we just need to consider three cases.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.970
Each of which can be calculated in constant time

00:03:12.970 --> 99:59:59.000
if we have the row previous to the row that we're trying to fill out.
