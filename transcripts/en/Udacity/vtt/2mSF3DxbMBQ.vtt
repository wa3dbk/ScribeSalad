So, the first thing we do, is grab the body dom object using

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:11.697
document.getElementById, with an id of body, and we create a div object, as well

00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:16.114
as a canvas object, and set their id's appropriately to div.id = "gameContent"

00:00:16.114 --> 00:00:24.687
and canvas.id = "gameCanvas" and finally, we append the div object to the body

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:28.448
and the canvas object to the div. If we open this up into our browser, we can

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.568
see that we have indeed created a div element and inside that is our new canvas

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.998
element and both with a proper id.
