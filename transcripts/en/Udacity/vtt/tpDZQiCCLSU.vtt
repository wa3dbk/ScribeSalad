00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.985
Well we know we can factor a 3 from both the 1st term and the 2nd term leaving

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:09.483
us with x minus 4 for our 2nd factor. For the denominator we know that they

00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:13.863
share a common factor of 5 so we put that out in front which leaves us with x

00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:18.386
minus 4 for our 2nd factor. So, this would be our factor rational expression

00:00:18.386 --> 00:00:19.893
great job if you found it.
