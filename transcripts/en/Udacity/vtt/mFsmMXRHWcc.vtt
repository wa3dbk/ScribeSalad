00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
So, if we take a look at the Jersey² team was worrying about,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.470
it's what most start-ups worry about on day 1,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.700
is does my value prop match my customer segment, and do I have product market fit?

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.100
You tend to worry about channels and customer relationships

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.960
and whether I can make money.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.690
You also are worrying about market size, etc.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.660
We kind of call this the right side of the canvas,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.520
or kind of the front stage.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.150
But the back end is equally important.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.890
In fact, in the Jersey² team, it's probably critical to get the partners

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.760
and the activities and the resources correct

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.020
because if they don't have jersey suppliers or their cleaning costs

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.380
or UPS costs correct, their expenses could be higher than their profits,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.130
so they really needed to nail down partners,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.670
and they needed to understand what they needed to be good at.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.050
Rental tracking, they needed a good rental system

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.080
to be able to figure out where the jerseys are.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.500
They needed to be experts at shipping and dry cleaning

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.850
and marketing and customer service, and they spent a lot of time

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.600
actually thinking about what they had to become good at.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.130
So, if you take a look at their key resources,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.570
they really needed to actually become good at a series of things.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.270
They needed to become great at inventory management

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.530
because they didn't want a warehouse of costly jerseys

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.220
sitting around just costing them money

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.230
if they weren't moving through and being turned.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.040
They needed some type of warehouse and logistics system,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.790
and the question they started asking even now was,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.290
"Is this something we should be running out of our own garage?"

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.460
"Is this something we could outsource?"

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.700
"Is this going to become a center of excellence for us

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.950
and a competitive advantage, or is this something that someone else could do?"

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.650
All this kind of added up to the left-hand side of this canvas,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.470
which is equivalent to revenue streams, but it's the cost.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.630
What are the costs of jerseys and warehousing and shipping and cleaning,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.750
logistic tracking,, website development, maintenance, customer service,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.140
employees, etc, and how does that match revenue streams?

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.300
Eventually, the right-hand side of the canvas down here needs to be bigger

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.710
than the left-hand side, not necessarily during the first year,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.009
but if it's not, then that tells you how much money you need to raise

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.440
and how much cash you need before you go cash-flow positive.

00:02:14.440 --> 99:59:59.000
So, all these pieces kind of add up to the calculus of doing a start-up.
