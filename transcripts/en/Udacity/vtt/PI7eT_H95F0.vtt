00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.566
In this exercise, you'll implement a rear view camera. It's not quite a rear

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:07.344
view mirror. Because left and right will not be reversed. Right now, the rear

00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:10.570
view camera is just focused on the center of the model. The position and target

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.350
never change. Your job is to make the rear view camera actually look backwards.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.700
Directly away from whatever the full screen camera is looking at. For its

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.170
position, use the same position as the forward camera. You'll probably need to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.159
use the camera's look at method. As well as some vector three methods. At least

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.780
I did. I've set up the two view ports. The one tricky bit in the code is that

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.020
scissoring is implemented. A scissor box defines a part of the screen that you

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.193
want to clear. This is needed so that the rear view camera view port properly

00:00:35.193 --> 00:00:39.324
clears its area on the screen, since it overlaps the larger view port. See the

00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:40.799
code to see what I'm talking about.
