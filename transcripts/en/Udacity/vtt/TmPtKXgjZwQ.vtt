00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the correct answer should be No.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If you marked Yes, and you insist on marking Yes--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
even though we're going to mark you Wrong--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
well, then you probably work on the App Engine Datastore,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and thank you for taking this course.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But for everybody else--myself included--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the answer is No.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You should get very comfortable with the App Engine Datastore

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
documentation--it's all online, there's a lot of it,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and it's very helpful.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We'll link to it in the course notes and we'll link to it in the homework.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I reference it a lot while I'm even teaching these lectures.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So anyway, get familiar with the docs--there's a lot to know--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and let's move on to the fun part.
