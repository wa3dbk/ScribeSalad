00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.860
The final solution is the cube root of 4xyz squared divided by 2x squared yz,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.714
that's some great algebra work, if you got that one correct. Again, let's start

00:00:09.714 --> 00:00:13.620
by thinking about what this denominator should look like in order for it to

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.203
simplify. We know we need the factors 2, x, y, and z to appear a multiple of

00:00:18.203 --> 00:00:24.000
three times. This means, that we want to change to the 1 To 2 to the 3rd. We

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.152
want to change x to the 5th to x to the 6th, y squared to y cubed, and z to z

00:00:29.152 --> 00:00:34.944
cubed. Notice how each of these powers is the next highest multiple of 3 for

00:00:34.944 --> 00:00:40.412
these powers. So to change this denominator we'll multiply by the cubed root of

00:00:40.412 --> 00:00:45.570
2 squared x y z squared. And since we multiplied this denominator by this

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.815
expression, we multiply the numerator by the same amount. Next we simplify the

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:54.310
numerator and the denominator. Our numerator can't be simplified so we just

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.915
rewrite 2 squared as 4. For our denominator, we take the cube root of each of

00:00:58.915 --> 00:01:05.300
these factors. We use power divided by root to get 2 x squared yz. And here's

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.652
our final answer.
