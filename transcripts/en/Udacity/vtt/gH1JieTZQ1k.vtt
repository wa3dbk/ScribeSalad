00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.840
Take a look at these columns of text.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.880
Some of you may be able to read
all of the columns and for

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.640
some of you, it might be a little
difficult or frustrating,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.700
especially as we get further
over to the right here.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.420
And what you're looking at is
a range of of contrasts and

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.750
above each column, I've placed a
contrast ratio which is the relationship

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.440
between the foreground color and the
background color in terms of luminance.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.885
When the colors are very similar,
we have a low contrast ratio.

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:29.523
When the colors are very different
we get a high contrast ratio.

00:00:29.523 --> 00:00:34.416
In section 1.4.3 the web link
checklist recommends a minimum

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:38.795
contrast ratio of 4.5 to 1 for
all body text and images.

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:43.582
An exception is made for
a larger text text that's about 120 or

00:00:43.582 --> 00:00:46.192
150% larger than the default body copy.

00:00:46.192 --> 00:00:49.270
For that larger text the ratio
can go down to 3 to 1.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.650
And the contrast ratio of 4.5
to 1 was chosen as a minimum,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.095
because it compensates for
the loss in contrast sensitivity,

00:00:56.095 --> 00:01:00.905
usually experienced by users with 20/40
vision and 20/40 vision is commonly

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:05.209
reported as the typical visual acuity
for someone of around 80 years of age.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.260
So, looking at our columns of text,
we can see that really only these

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.260
first two columns would pass for
acceptable body copy.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.040
The third one here is just a little
too low on the contrast scale, and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.615
this last one is far too light.

00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:22.015
Now I mention that these
are contrast minimums.

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.045
So while they might work well for

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:27.425
someone who has lost a bit of vision as
they age they will not necessarily work

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:31.236
well for all users, especially those who
suffer from a low vision impairment.

00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:35.745
For users with low vision impairments,
or color vision deficiencies

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:38.815
we can increase the contrast
up to a ratio of 7 to 1 for

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:42.400
body copy and 4.5 to 1 for larger text.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.120
Looking again at our
columns we can see that,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.670
really only this first column
would meet that criteria.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.740
Now since most modern web sites
use a range of type sizes and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.880
colors, you're going to need a way
to quickly audit your page to

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.240
verify that you're meeting
these contrasts requirements.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.600
To do this we can use the Chrome
accessibility dev tools extension.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.790
So what I want to do is audit this page,
I'm going to open my dev tools,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.830
I'm going to go to the Audits panel and
I'll run an accessibility audit.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.700
And I can see that the extension is
reporting a number of accessibility

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.150
errors all related to my anchor tags.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.270
So let me go inspect one of those anchor
tags right now, click on this one

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.820
right over I'll bump the font size up
a little bit so this is easier to read.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.670
And when I go and
look at the accessibility properties for

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.310
this item I'm presented with
a number of options here.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.470
First I see a warning indicating
that my contrast is just too low.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.959
And then I see options for
minimum and enhanced contrast.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.230
Now the nice thing is that
the hex values are right here so

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.160
I can just copy these into
my style sheet if I want.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.900
But one really cool feature of
the dev tools extension is that I can

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.970
click on the swatches and see
the anchor tags update in the document.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.820
So I can see here for instance that that
is what the enhanced colors would look

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.620
like in my application.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.420
Now, in the next lesson,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.410
I'm going to have you audit
a page using the same extension.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.620
So that way,
you can fix up any errors that you find.
