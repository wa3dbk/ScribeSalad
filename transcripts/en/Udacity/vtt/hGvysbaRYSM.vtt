00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.070
To do this, we'll need to add a counter. The counter will be incremented every

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.670
time you look at a word, not only when we find a long word, because we want to

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.940
count how many short words come before the long word. Let's try to hand trace a

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.960
little bit and see if this would work. If the first word is longer than nine

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.514
characters, that would mean we would want to return a position of zero. So we

00:00:20.514 --> 00:00:24.210
would go into the loop, we would find the word, we would go into the if

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.146
statement because the word length would be longer than nine. We would mark the

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:34.199
word as found. And then we would increment position to one. Okay, that's not

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.388
quite right, so, maybe this we'll need to start at negative one. So that'll fix

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:41.970
it for the case where the first word is long. What if the first word is short,

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.411
and the second word is long? We'll start with position as -1, go into the while

00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:53.157
loop. There are more words, and it's not found yet. We read the word. The word

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:58.470
is short, so we skip past the if statement and increment the position to zero.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.670
Now we go back into the loop. There are more words, and we still haven't found

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.883
it. We read the second word, which is long so we go into the if statement, set

00:01:05.883 --> 00:01:11.488
longWord to be the word that we just read, and say that we found it. Then

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:15.457
update the position which was previously zero, so now it'll be one, and then

00:01:15.457 --> 00:01:18.503
get back to the while loop. But we

00:01:18.503 --> 00:01:19.008
[UNKNOWN]

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:23.584
found so we break out, this should work, but I forgot to print it. Alright it

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:27.056
looks like the first long word in Alice in Wonderland is Adventures and its

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:32.001
position is one. Let's compare this to the text. It looks like Adventures in

00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:35.535
position one and it's no wonder it would be related to the book, it's part of

00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:37.359
the title.
