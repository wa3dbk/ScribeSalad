00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.090
Okay, looks like users are making
accounts on our backends, so

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.600
that's cool.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.130
But, none of them can actually login.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.540
Before my roommates start a riot,
let's add some login functionality.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.720
Here's a quick overview of what happens
behind the scenes when you login with

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.860
Firebase.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.780
In the code for your app,
you'll call authWithPassword().

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.800
This sends a message to your
online Firebase database to try to

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.180
authenticate the user.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.750
The online Firebase database has
a hidden credential data store,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.840
which includes hashes of emails and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.620
passwords of users that have
been created in your Firebase.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.510
Firebase is doing the hard work of
actually checking the credentials.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.630
And if successful, it creates something
called an AuthData object and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.650
adjacent web token.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.332
This adjacent web token,
also called a JWT,

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:46.365
is a token that is automatically
stored for you by the Firebase SDK.

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:48.497
It gets stored in local storage for
you app, and

00:00:48.497 --> 00:00:50.650
this arrives between
between app reloads.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.600
It's this token that allows your user to
stay logged in even if they close and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.780
then reopen the app.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.560
Then again, this part is
automatically taken care of for you.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.382
So you don't really need to worry about
JWTs or doing anything with them.

00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:03.690
The AuthData object,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.390
on the other hand, is something that's
explicitly returned to your code.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.005
And it's an object that contains
basic data about the user.

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:13.125
So then when you get the AuthData
object back in your app,

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.860
you can use this data to update your UI.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.890
As a developer, from your vantage point,
all you really have to do is call this

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.080
method here and
then get a AuthData object back.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.580
The rest of this is handled by Firebase.
