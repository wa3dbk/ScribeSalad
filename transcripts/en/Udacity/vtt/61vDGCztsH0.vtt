00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.790
So now let us try our hand at some tree height reduction.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.680
Suppose we have these six instructions. We are adding R1 and R2,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.420
putting the result in R10. Then subtracting R3 from that. Then adding R4.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.590
Then subtracting R5. Then adding R6, and then subtracting R7.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.150
If we now do a tree height reduction on this, what do we get? And

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.630
I already pre-populated most of the answers for you. So,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.820
we're still going to add R1 and R2, and put the result in R10. But then,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.910
what do we add and put in R11? What do we add R11 to and

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.070
put that in R10? What do we then add up and put the result in R11?

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.340
And then we add R7 to what, and put the result in R11? And

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.050
finally, we will subtract R11 from R10, and get the final result in R10.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.970
And this should be the same result that we got here. So, the question for

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.320
you is what should be in these five places? And also,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.090
the ILP here is clearly six cycles for six instructions, which gets us a one.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.750
Why? Well, because each of the instructions depends on the previous one.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.010
With your new tree height reduced code, what is the LP?

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.100
We still have six instructions. How many cycles do we need to do them now?
