00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through the answers together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're looking for a space in "Ada Lovelace", and there is a space right here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This "a" is at position 0, "d" is at position 1, "a" is at position 2.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So this space is at position 3.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now we're looking for an "n" in "Alan Turing", and there are two.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The first one is at position 3, but here we're asked to start from position 4,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so the one we'll get is this last "n" at position 9.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Ada Lovelace is widely regarded as the first computer programmer.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In fact, she wrote the first computer program for computing some mathematics

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
before computers themselves even really existed.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
They were just plans or blueprints.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Similarly, Alan Turing is often regarded as one of the leaders or founders of computer science.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.246
The Nobel Prize in computer science is called the Turing Award.
