00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
So welcome to Unit 2. In the last unit we encountered three computer scientists

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.400
as I hope you'll remember, Alice, Bob, and Carol.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.640
And as you'll recall, all three were working on rather tough problems

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.470
for which they weren't able to find an efficient algorithm.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.180
Alice was working in telecommunications, and her task was for the network of her employer

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.160
to find the minimum number of monitoring devices that needed to be installed

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.110
to monitor all cables in the telecommunications network.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.950
Bob was working in bioinformatics, and his job was to find clusters of data in genetic analysis.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.910
And finally, Carol was working in finance and she has been tasked with

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.080
selecting a portfolio of assets that consists of as many assets as possible

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.600
but it has to observe a number of restrictions, which assets she can put together in one portfolio.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.560
Now, at the end of the last unit, we stated these problems as problems on graphs

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.709
and we're going to do a little recall quiz here to see if you remember

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.360
which problems they were working on when we stated this as a graph problem.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.380
The three problems we're looking at were called independent set, clique, and vertex cover

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.300
and all of those three problems took as input a graph with n vertices.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.840
For independent set, you were then looking for the maximum number of vertices

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.420
where none of those vertices you have selected are connected to each other.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.320
For clique, you were looking for a maximum number of vertices

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.420
where all of them are connected.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.360
And for vertex cover, we were looking for a minimum number of vertices to cover all edges

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.800
meaning that every edge must have at least one endpoint in the set of vertices that we selected.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.390
So here's our first quiz and I would like to see if you remember

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.770
which of these computer scientists, so Alice working in telecommunications,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.310
Bob working in bioinformatics, and Carol working in finance,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.600
which of these computer scientists were working on which of these problems here?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.700
And they way I want you to answer this is for each of the problems just select if

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.880
that was the problem that Alice was working on, or the problem that Bob was working on,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.919
or the problem that Carol was working on.

00:02:08.919 --> 99:59:59.000
And the same here for clique and vertex cover.
