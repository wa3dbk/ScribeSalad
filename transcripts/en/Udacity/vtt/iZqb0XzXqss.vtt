00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730
In my opinion, I would say that the assumption that simple operation

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.760
take only one-time step is rather unrealistic

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.680
because in real computer you have lots of differences between simple operations

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.660
and also loops such as ifs and whys it can take very different amounts of time

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.810
depending on where and when they are executed.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.860
The second one we have as much memory as we need that might be debatable for some cases

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.590
given that memory is actually not that expensive anymore,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.630
but there's still lots of problems where you can run out of memory and so that is still a real issue.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.170
I would also say this is rather unrealistic.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.810
Memory access being free in terms of times that is very unrealistic

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.790
because in the real computer, you really have to watch out

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.250
what kind of memory you're using.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.540
For example, if you're using register and a processor

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.900
that is memory that almost come for free that's very fast,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.410
but when you have to read and write to your hard disk that is going to take very long.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.330
Memory access being free is really unrealistic.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:03.110
Finally, a unit of memory not being able to hold an arbitrarily large number that is very realistic

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.860
because your computer depending on how many bits each unit of memory can hold.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.720
If its 32 or 64 and there is always the limit of how much you can store in a single unit of memory

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.040
and then you have to go to the next one.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.790
Given that there's lots of unrealistic aspects for the RAM,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.760
why are we using it in this course?

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.850
Well, there's basically two reasons. The first reason is that its a very simple model to use.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.840
So, if we have to consider all of those aspect as well,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.409
our analysis would get even more complicated than in the simple example.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.100
And the second thing is that when we are running or analyzing algorithms on the RAM,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.440
the general behavior of the algorithm, how it behaves on various inputs,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.070
and how the running time changes with various types of inputs

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.920
still is rather realistic even though we're not really taking into account these aspects.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.950
When you have to implement an algorithm,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.880
which is something that we're not doing in this course

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.230
then of course, you have to take care of these things

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.340
and see for example if the types of operation you're using is making your algorithm

00:02:08.340 --> 99:59:59.000
run faster or slower or if you need to take care of memory.
