00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let's take a look at the last type of market, it's the clone market.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This takes foreign business models and adapts it to local conditions.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What's a foreign business model--typically right now,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
a foreign business model is one that's occurring in the US.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What's a local condition?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Well, if the language is different than English or your culture is different than the US

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
or if your country has import restrictions or your local control and ownership

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and you have a market large enough to support a business model.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Typically, a country's worth more than 100 million people that fit this criteria

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
might be China, India, Russia, Brazil--even though EU itself; just cloning US

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
business models that exist is not a bad business strategy.
