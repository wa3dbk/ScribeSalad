Let's wrap up this lesson by looking at adding and subtracting complex numbers.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.196
Any number that is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number is an

00:00:08.196 --> 00:00:13.832
example of a complex number. Complex numbers are in the form a plus bi or a

00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:18.819
minus bi. A and b are any real numbers and the second term is an imaginary

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:25.600
number. It's imaginary because it has i or the square root of negative 1.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.196
Instead of writing the square root of negative 1 all the time, we usually just

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:32.633
write i. So if we want to add or subtract any complex numbers together, we

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:37.463
treat i just like a radical. We can combine any terms that both contain an i,

00:00:37.463 --> 00:00:41.657
since they both have a square root of negative 1. So what do you think these

00:00:41.657 --> 00:00:45.644
would be. If we added this complex number to this complex number, what would be

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:50.890
the answer? And if we subtracted this complex number from this one, what would

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.100
be the result? Keep in mind that you really need to just combine like terms.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.428
You're also need to remember what to do when subtracting a quantity. Good luck

00:01:00.428 --> 00:01:02.233
on this one.
