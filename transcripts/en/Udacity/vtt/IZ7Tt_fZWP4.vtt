00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.190
Alright, so with the symmetric distributions like our normal

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.230
distribution, the one sided p-value is simply going to

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.590
be half of our two sided p-value. Remember that

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.880
the p-value is the probability that given the null

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.340
hypothesis is true, we would observe a test statistic

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.800
at least as extreme as what we saw. So

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.630
instead of having both sides of this distribution, we're

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.440
really only going to have one side of the distribution.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.970
So we have a one-sided t-test where we're checking whether the

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.560
mean of sample one is greater than the mean of sample two.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.840
We still want p over two to be less than our p

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.640
critical, maybe that's 0.05, but we want our t value to be

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.410
greater than zero. Whereas for a less than one-sided t-test, where

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.820
we're testing whether the mean of sample one is less than the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.870
mean of sample two, we want p over 2 to be less

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.590
than p critical, but we want our t value to be less

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.807
than 0.
