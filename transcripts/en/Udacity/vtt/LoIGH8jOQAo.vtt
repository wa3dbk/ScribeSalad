As you can see, web performance is a pretty

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.880
huge topic, and it's constantly changing as web browsers change

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.410
and update. We can't give you a definitive list of

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.210
things to do and not to do. What we really

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.990
want you to take away from this lesson is the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.440
need to constantly analyze your web app's performance. If you

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.900
have the right tools, and you familiarize yourself with how

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.480
to use them. You can build amazingly performant web applications.
