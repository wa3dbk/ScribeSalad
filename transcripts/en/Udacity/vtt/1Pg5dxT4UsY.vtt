00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.228
I hope you've been cruising along through the course so far. Now, I'm going to

00:00:03.228 --> 00:00:07.650
throw you a little roadblock. Let's say your car breaks down at mile marker 210

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.883
while driving down Interstate I-80. I-80 runs from west to east in the state of

00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:18.254
Nevada, and the interstate cuts across the entire state. Since your car's

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:23.398
broken down, you need to walk to the nearest town. Using the map in the car you

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:29.734
determine that there's a gas station 21 miles south of mile marker 190. So, you

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:36.033
know you're here and you're wondering what's the distance to mile marker 190?
