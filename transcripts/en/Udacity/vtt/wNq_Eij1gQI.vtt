00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.424
So how do neurons send signals to and from the brain? Well let's take the

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:08.026
example that you have a bee flying around your head. You either see it or you

00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:11.534
hear it. Your sensory neurons pick up this information and send it to your

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:16.515
brain to be processed. Then your motor neurons take this signal and send it to

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.536
your muscles and that allows you to swat the bee away or get up and run,

00:00:19.536 --> 00:00:24.500
whatever you're going to do. Now how these messages are sent are because of an

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.950
action potential. Now an action potential is an explosion of electricity that

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.280
sends information down an axon away from the cell body. When the electrical

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.630
voltage of a neuron reaches a threshold level, that's when the action potential

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.160
fires. Now this electrical impulse triggers a chemical release and that's how

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.988
neurons communicate with each other. There's a lot more details that go into

00:00:45.988 --> 00:00:48.440
these. So I'm going to let Greg explain it to you a little better.
