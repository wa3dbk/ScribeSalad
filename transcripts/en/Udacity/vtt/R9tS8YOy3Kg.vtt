00:00:00.362 --> 00:00:02.455
And that's it, job done.

00:00:02.455 --> 00:00:04.867
We've taken an entirely
online only site and

00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:07.154
made it an offline
first progressive app.

00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:09.365
By making it to the end of this course,

00:00:09.365 --> 00:00:12.422
you're ready to take on
any offline first project.

00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:16.117
Wittr was specifically designed to cover
most of the gnarly edge cases you'll

00:00:16.117 --> 00:00:17.240
encounter in the wild.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.970
For example, cache versioning for
big updates like theme changes,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.406
interactive updates to get the user onto
the latest version, dealing with server

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:29.714
rendering by serving a page skeleton,
responsive images, multiple caches,

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:33.603
you even had to master indexedDB,
the most feared API in the platform.

00:00:33.603 --> 00:00:34.904
You did it all.

00:00:34.904 --> 00:00:37.986
But to spell out exactly what we
achieved, for the very last time,

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:39.263
we dial into America land.

00:00:39.263 --> 00:00:40.927
Mike, are you there?

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:41.817
&gt;&gt; I am.

00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:44.534
&gt;&gt; Show us where we started and
where we are now?

00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:45.835
&gt;&gt; With pleasure.

00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:48.605
If the user's on some kind
of non-perfect connection,

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:51.965
they used have to wait for the page
to appear, and imagery took ages.

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:54.747
Now, stuff appears on
the screen instantly.

00:00:54.747 --> 00:00:58.772
Lie-fi users used to be left staring
at a white screen forever, but

00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:00.760
now they get content instantly.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.533
Offline users used to get
a browser error page.

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:06.974
Now they get content and
a non-disruptive custom error.

00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:10.174
This is a huge improvement
in the user experience.

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:11.948
&gt;&gt; If your site works offline first,

00:01:11.948 --> 00:01:15.933
users are going to notice that it loads
reliably and fast whatever the network.

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:19.439
They'll have a less frustrating
experience with your site than the rest

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.432
of the web, and that's what matters,
the user experience.

00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:24.751
And with that, it's goodbye from me.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:25.769
&gt;&gt; And goodbye from me.

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:30.445
&gt;&gt; We look forward to a web that
works whatever the connection is.
