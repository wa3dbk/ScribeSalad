Here you can see that I'm
running a very simple app

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.370
that I've called LocationLesson1.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.550
You build this application
using Location Services and

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.750
the techniques that you'll use for
building this application can be used

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.150
across many of the different services
that you'll learn in this course.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.780
So, how did we get here and
how did we build this?

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.650
