00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.820
So now let's talk about how
authentication can be implemented.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.520
It could be something
that the user knows.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.660
So this has to be a secret, a secret
that is shared between the user and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.510
the system.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.775
The fact that you are able to produce
that secret that's associated with

00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:18.265
the user,
that means you are that person.

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:21.195
That is the evidence that
you are who you claim to be.

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:23.665
A password for
example is a secret, isn't it?

00:00:23.665 --> 00:00:28.505
We say ask people to pick a password
that others can not guess or

00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:29.395
easily guess.

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:30.645
Well, that's your secret.

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:34.925
So one way to do
authentication is that users

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:39.920
have a secret that they can produce
to the system and the system is able

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.600
to check that the secret really is the
one that is associated with that user.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.640
The other possibility is
something the user has.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.740
So think of this some sort of a token or
a smart card or something

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.090
that you use and the fact that you have
it means you have possession of it.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.910
So, possession of that token, we have to
talk about how this could be used for

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.190
authentication.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.580
The fact that it's with you, smart
card or token is with you, a fob, for

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.530
example, people use that.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.290
That's with you, that means it must be
the user who you're claiming to be or

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.650
the user who should be possessing
this particular thing.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.770
The first thing is
something you would know.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.680
The second is something you have on you,
or with you.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.120
The third thing we can think
of is something the user is or

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.550
something you are.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.620
So this could be for
example your finger print.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.350
This could be your voice, for example,
people talk about voice biometric,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.510
or their smartphone devices that
you can talk to, for example.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.190
So this would be a biometric,
something that is unique, hopefully,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.090
to the user, because we don't want
somebody else to become you, so

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.470
this biometric has to be
something that's specific to you.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.070
And if you're able to produce that,
the system you're able to give that to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.920
the system and the system is able
to check that actually it is your

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.520
fingerprint then the authentication
is based on something the user is.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.590
Something you know, something you have,
or something you are.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.990
These are sort of the three basic
methods that are used in almost all

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.080
the authentication techniques
that we use in computer systems.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.220
So we are going to again look a little
bit more deeply into how authentication

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.000
is implemented, using one of these
methods that we talked about.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.710
A secret you share with the system,
or something you have, or

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.640
something you are.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.290
So the basic sort of sequence of
steps that we're going to have is

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.100
that the user is actually going
to come to the system and

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.290
is going to request access to it.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.630
And we know that is going to
start with request for

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.990
authentication, you first have
to authenticate yourself.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.290
The system, the operating system here
is going to take whatever claim about

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.990
identity you make, so for example you
may be saying this is my log in name.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.810
So it's going to read those
keystrokes and that's who you are.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.830
And if you're providing,
for example, a password,

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.590
then the operating system at this point
is going to run this login program and

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.960
the login program is going to check
that information that you provide.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.980
For example, the password you
provide Is really your password.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.708
Is the password we have
associated with this user?

00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:34.820
If there's a match with
what the system knows and

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.930
what you provide,
that is a true positive.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.610
If it's the right user then that's a
true positive, the outcome is positive.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.270
Here, so the user is authenticated and
when the user is authenticated,

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.650
this is how you can now initiate any
further actions you want to perform.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.700
So this is sort of the case
where the right user

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.870
provides the right kind of evidence.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.080
The log in program is able to check and
successfully log in the user.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.760
Well, the check could fail and if it
fails then the system believes that

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.140
the user has not provided
the correct information.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.680
And if the user has not provided
the correct information,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.970
it's probably not the user
who is being claimed.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.890
The identity that is being claimed

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.800
probably doesn't belong to the user
who is asking for authentication.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.360
So this could be impersonation for
example.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.730
So in this case, the system
doesn't have the right evidence,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.710
doesn't have this match, so
it's not going to authenticate the user.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.890
So in this case, authentication fails.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.820
Maybe you retype your password.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.740
If you're not the right user,
then that's a good thing.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.610
So then, that if you are not the right
user, even you are trying to

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.380
login as Alice and
the system says no, that's good.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.890
That is a true negative actually
because outcome is negative and

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.230
it's the right thing.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.980
Okay so Eve tries to login as Alice and
we end up here.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.500
That's a true negative.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.830
When Alice tries to login as Alice.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.950
We come here, that is a true positive.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.940
So this is how the authentication
process is implemented.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.340
Couple of things to note here is
that we have to read the evidence or

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.660
capture the evidence.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.970
We have to compare it and
then decide whether there's a match or

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.860
not and go either this path or
the other path.
