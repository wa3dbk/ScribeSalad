00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.250
In objective C,
a pointer to an error is generally

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.380
passed as the last parameter
to a method that could fail.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.980
If the method does indeed fail, a value
can be assigned to the error pointer.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.770
Let's take a look at an example.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.550
This method,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.240
do something that might fail with error
could be used something like this.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.060
Note that because we're passing a
pointer to a pointer, we use the double

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.510
asterisks in the method definition and
we use the ampersand in the method call.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.350
If you take a look at the NSError class
reference, you'll notice that NSError

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.240
has three properties: domain,
code, and a user info dictionary.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.140
These properties are access to
get additional information about

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.080
the cause of an error.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.372
A similar error causing function
in Swift would look like this.

00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:49.780
Swift uses the keyword throws
rather than an error parameter.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.290
And here's what the method
call might look like.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.430
Notice the do catch statement.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.510
In Swift, if you have a method that
throws an error it's required that that

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.640
error be handled either with a try or
a do catch statement.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.569
And Objective C on the other hand,

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.260
it's perfectly acceptable to
ignore an error completely.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.655
The error itself might
look something like this.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.870
You'll often see each error case
handled individually, like so.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.440
Remember that enum members can
be associated with values.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.990
One can use associated values to
provide information about errors.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.260
And if we run this,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.040
we can see the string associated with
each error printed to the console.
