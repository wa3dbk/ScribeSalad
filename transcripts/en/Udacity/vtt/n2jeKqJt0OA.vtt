00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.370
But what if you wanted to call a function and it didn't happen to be stored as

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.820
a property of the object that you want the parameter this to be bound to?

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.910
So imagine this function looks great but

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.770
the keyword this is supposed to refer to a specific object.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.130
And that specific object doesn't have this function as a property.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.150
There would be no way,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.400
in that situation, to address this function as the given object dot anything.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.020
If this isn't stored as a property,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.850
there's no key you can use on that object in order to access the function.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.369
Besides the left of the dot rule that we just described,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.510
there's actually another way for

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.370
you to specify the value that you'd like the parameter this to get bound to.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.290
Let's make a copy of that previous line which had the effect of assigning global

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.060
as the default binding for this, and we'll edit the line with an attempt to

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.960
specify exactly what we'd like this function to bind the keyword this to.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.020
By using a function's .call method, we get to override the default binding to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.400
global and override the left of the dot rule.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.010
In this case, we'll pass in any value we want and

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.350
it'll get bound to the keyword this.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.380
When using .call,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.690
we pass in one extra value at the beginning of the argument list.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.410
And that value will be bound to the parameter this.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.440
So what would happen if we used .call on a function that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.920
was also being accessed as a property?

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.650
Here we're using .call to pass in this new yellow object, but

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.080
that method was already found as a property of the red object.
