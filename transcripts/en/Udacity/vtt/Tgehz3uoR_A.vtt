Congratulations, we did so much.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.860
You laid out your long term goals
into your Vision Statement.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.560
You put your short term goals
in your Mission Statement.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.540
And you made a list the steps
showing how you plan to get there.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.510
In the next lesson,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.280
we'll break down these milestones into
the skills required to accomplish them.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.110
This will get you ready to start
taking action on your ideas.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.800
So, bring your plans and
I'll see you there.
