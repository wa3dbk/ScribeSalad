00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.680
Welcome to the last lesson. Here, we're going to return to

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.490
a data set that we've talked about several times before, the open

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.750
street map data set, and we're going to make a case study

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.550
out of it. There are several reasons why we chose to use

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.120
this data set for the case study. First is that it's

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.540
a really nice data set, freely available for download, and it's XML,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.490
which is a data format we've gained some experience with During this

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.230
course, now this is a human edited data set. So for our

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.480
purposes this is great because there are a lot of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.270
opportunities for cleaning. And it's relatable. You can download the

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.310
data for your own city block, your favorite summer travel

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.300
destination or a place you want to visit someday. And finally,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.350
it's open source. Anyone can contribute to this data set.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.610
And you can potentially submit back the improvements you made.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.540
As you work through this case study. Just an option.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.680
Now, the exercises we'll use the data set that I chose,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.600
of a city that I know very well, Chicago. Now

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.320
we're going to grade the submissions according to this data set,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.670
but please bear in mind that there might be cultural

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.660
differences in how, for example, phone numbers or addresses. Are formatted.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.110
What makes sense in Chicago might not make sense in,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.750
say, Kobe. So, if you want to take your improvements

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230
back to the community that created the map, you should

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.210
take local specifics into account. Okay. Good luck, and have fun.
