00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.290
Now let us consider analogical mapping. The problem here is called

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.360
the correspondent's problem. There are a number of obvious relationships in this

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.890
target problem. There are a number of obvious relationships in this source case.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.180
What in the target problem corresponds to what in the source case?

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.410
If we can address the correspondence problem. If we can say, for

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.770
example, that the laser beam corresponds to the rebel army,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.710
then we can start aligning the target problem and

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.659
the source case so it makes the deep similarities between relationships salient.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.810
Note there are several parts of a target problem and several in the source case.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.930
In principle, any of these objects of the target problem could correspond to any

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.220
of the objects in the source case. In which case we would have an m

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.430
to n mapping, and that becomes computationally inefficient. If you and I,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.530
often do not have much of a problem deciding, if the laser beam must correspond

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.390
to the devil army. How do we do it? And how can we help AI agents make

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.069
similar kind of correspondences? Our answer is, we'll make use of relationships.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:09.160
In fact, we'll make use of higher order relationships, whenever possible.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.100
We'll give precedence to higher order relationships, over other relationships.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.610
As a unary relationship, we might say that a patient is a person here, and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.850
king is a person there. The binary relationship we might say, that physician has

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.510
a resource, the laser beam. And that the rebel army has a resource, the army

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.310
itself. It's a higher ordered relationship, a tertiary relationship between say,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.760
that between the goal and the resource is an obstacle. They held a tissue in

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.450
this case. Similarly between the goal and the resource is an obstacle,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.590
the minds in this case. We focus on the higher ordered relationship there,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.670
that's where the deepest similarity between the two situations lies. This is

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.980
how we know to mark between the king and the tumor and not between the king and

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.340
the patient. Although the king and the patient are superficially similar,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.700
a deeper similarity lies in viewing the king and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.620
the tumor in terms of goals which need to be cured or

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.360
captured using a resource when there is an obstacle in between them.
