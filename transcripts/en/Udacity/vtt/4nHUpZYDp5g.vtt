00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.760
As we said, one major component of bipolar disorder is depression. A person

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.760
needs to be clinically depressed for the most part, but they also need to

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.324
experience mania. Now to help you remember the symptoms of the mania stage,

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:19.219
there is a mnemonic device that you can use. And that's DIGFAST. First we have

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:24.512
distractability, then indiscretion, grandiosity, flight of ideas, activity

00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:29.647
increased, sleep, which during the mania stage, you have a decreased need for

00:00:29.647 --> 00:00:35.200
And talkativeness. There are different types of bipolar disorder, but we're

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.905
only going to discuss three here. Let's start with bipolar I and bipolar II.

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:45.898
Bipolar I is more severe. That's because the person meets the clinical criteria

00:00:45.898 --> 00:00:52.120
for major depression and for mania for at least seven consecutive days. On the

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.840
other hand, with bipolar II the individual meets the criteria for major

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.764
depression and the criteria for hypomania. Hypomania episodes are similar to

00:01:01.764 --> 00:01:06.753
the symptoms of mania. So think about that DIGFAST mnemonic device that we just

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:11.782
spoke about. However, these episodes are much shorter in duration, they last

00:01:11.782 --> 00:01:16.742
for at least four consecutive days. So we see the difference between hypomania

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:19.914
and mania as the distinction between someone having a more severe form of

00:01:19.914 --> 00:01:25.426
bipolar or less severe form. Nevertheless, whenever it's bipolar I or II, it's

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:31.018
clear to see how it can be a difficult disorder to live with. In fact, it can

00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:34.870
be exhausting. However, there are treatments available which we'll discuss in

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.490
our next lesson. Of the third disorder we'll discuss is called cyclothymia.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.020
This is the milder, but longer-lasting form of bipolar disorder. This has both

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.980
manic and depressive episodes, but it's less severe than bipolar II disorder,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.820
because in the manic and the depressive symptoms never reach the criteria of

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.783
major depression or even hypomania.
