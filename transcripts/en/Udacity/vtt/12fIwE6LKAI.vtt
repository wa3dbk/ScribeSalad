00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.042
Thinking back to what information we decided was important in the last quiz,

00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:07.948
we're going to use that to create a word equation for the cost to make 92

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.310
glasses wipers. So try to remember which quantities we decided were relevant for

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:16.579
figuring out this problem, and then think about how those 2 quantities might be

00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:21.030
related to each other. Place the letter of each quantity that you'd like to be

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:25.510
an equation in these teal boxes, one in each box of course. And then pick which

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:29.850
of these four operators you think relates the two of them together. Should they

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:34.645
be added, subtracted, divided or multiplied? Remember that what we're going for

00:00:34.657 --> 00:00:38.580
in the end, we want this side of the equation to equal is the cost of

00:00:38.592 --> 00:00:40.720
manufacturing 92 glasses wiper sets.
