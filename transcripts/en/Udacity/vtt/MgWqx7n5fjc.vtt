00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.200
Okay, so you saw that the UI button has
an intrinsic size based on the text and

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.960
image it may contain.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.455
That means we only need two constraints
to center this button on our view.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:13.790
One for the x coordinate, and
one for the y coordinate.

00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:19.050
There are two ways to add these
constraints, and I'll cover both here.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.790
With the record button selected,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.940
you can click on the align button
that looks like a bar graph.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.110
If you're having trouble
finding the record button,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.460
remember to use you document
outline here and select it there.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.299
With the record button selected,
click on the align button,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.930
which looks like a bar graph here,
and then select these two options on

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.300
the bottom to center it horizontally and
vertically in the container.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.280
And then select add two constraints.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.490
We can now see both constraints in the
record button in the document outline.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.770
You can expand these triangles if
you want to see them actually here.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.400
And, if you're like me, you may have
encountered the first on a layout issue,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.820
which is these orange lines
that you see here, or

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.130
this yellow disclosure here
that you can see at the top.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.110
Now, let's fix that
first before we run it.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.070
So if you click on this tiny arrow,
we can see that Xcode expects that our

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.470
button be on X of 276, width of 29 and

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.110
height of 30, and its height is 32.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.940
So if we expand this
out a little bit and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.100
click on this one,
we can get it to fix the frame.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.960
That is to fix the size of the button so

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.440
it matches the constraints
that we've declared.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.260
We'll do that.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.610
We can see it's trimmed a record
button to fit just the text or

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.630
just intrinsic size of our button.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.710
Let's see if adding
these constraints works.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.820
Let's select the iPhone 6s here
on the simulator drop down, and

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.510
press the run button, or
hit command and r on your keyboard.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.370
We should see the record button
on the center of the screen.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.870
With the iPhone simulator selected,
press and hold down the command key, and

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.310
then use the right or
left arrows to rotate the simulator.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.620
I'm going to use the right arrow here
to rotate it to landscape right.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.060
And I can use the left arrow
to rotate back to portrait.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.900
In both orientations, we can see that
our button stayed in the center.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.100
Now let's try it on an iPad Air 2
which is a lot larger than iPhone 6s.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.780
If I move this to the side,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.460
we can go back into Xcode,
and press the stop button.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.700
We can here in the drop-down
select an iPad Air 2 and hit run.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.380
Now we have a record button, but

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.850
it looks like our iPad simulator
is too big to fit on our screen.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.640
What do we do?

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.290
We could go out and buy a large tunnel
of display, and I would recommend that.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.870
We could petition Johnny Ive to bring
back the 17 inch Macbook Pro laptop.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.350
Well, there's an easier option.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.850
With the iPhone simulator selected,
let's go in to window, and then scale.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.660
And you can choose
a different size here.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.350
For example, let's do 33%.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.160
That makes our iPad a lot smaller.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.540
And we can see it.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.088
We can use the command keys to jump
around between those sizes, too.

00:03:03.088 --> 00:03:05.545
For example,
Cmd+3 will get us a little bit bigger,

00:03:05.545 --> 00:03:09.160
Cmd+2 will get us even bigger and
now it's, again, offscreen.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.010
So let's stick with Cmd+3.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.990
Here you can see the record button is
still in the center of the screen,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.410
even if I use Cmd and arrow keys to
rotate the iPad to landscape right,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.470
or back to landscape left.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.920
By the way, these options just scale
down the size of the ioS simulator as

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.200
a whole to what you're seeing.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.290
For your app,
everything is still the same size.
