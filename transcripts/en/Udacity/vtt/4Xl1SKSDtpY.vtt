Now it's time to actually start putting some reality into our games. Robots

00:00:03.764 --> 00:00:08.350
running over walls and going through things is so 1983. So what we're going to

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.830
be talking about this unit is how to actually add collisions and physics to

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.430
your environment so that your robots can run around, shoot missiles, get into

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.919
all sorts of cooky troubles. Now be warned, this is a little bit of a deep unit

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.543
so make sure you've had a bio break and you've got enough caffeine handy to get

00:00:20.543 --> 00:00:23.890
through the whole thing. I'll see you on the other side.
