00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's take another quick quiz and this one like the broken prime number function I showed you

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is designed to pry into the limitations of coverage metrics.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So your job now is to insert a bug into the stats module, that is to say make it wrong but in a 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
way that's undetectable by test cases that get full statement coverage.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So test 1 is a function that you write which contains either the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
test cases you just submitted or different ones.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
These test cases together need to achieve 100% statement coverage for the stats function

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but we must not reveal the bug--that is to say you're broken stats function needs to return

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the correct answer for the test cases presented here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The second thing I want you to do is define a function test 2, which also

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
calls the stats function, and this one should reveal the bug.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Your assignment is to break the stats function in such a way that the flaw is undetectable

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
by test cases that you design would get a 100% test coverage, but also you

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
need to show us what the flaw is by supplying a second test case.
