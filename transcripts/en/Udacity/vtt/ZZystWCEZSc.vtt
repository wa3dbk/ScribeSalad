00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.710
This first statement is true. PCP is generally undecidable for 7 pairs of strings or more.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.540
To see that you only need 7 pairs of strings to specify any computer program,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.410
and that includes undecidable computer programs.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.280
If PCP was decidable for 7 pairs of strings or more,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.620
then you would be able to answer undecidable questions.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.620
The second statement is not true.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.290
PCP is not generally decidable for 6 pairs of strings or less.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.160
That's because we don't know if we can represent an undecidable computer program

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.700
with less than 7 pairs of strings.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.700
We might well be able to. We can't say this for certain.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.340
This third statement is true.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.630
Any SAT problem can be transformed into a PCP using 7 strings.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.930
We might be able to transform it into a PCP using less than 7 strings,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.180
but if we can do that we can certainly use 7 strings

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.340
and just not actually use them in our list of decisions.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.330
By that same reasoning, this last statement is not true.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.260
No PCP instance with 7 pairs of strings or more is decidable.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.040
That's actually not the case, because you can think of a decidable program

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.040
with less than 7 strings or 7 pairs of strings,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.700
and then simply add in more strings that you don't end up using.

00:01:11.700 --> 99:59:59.000
This is perfectly acceptable. So this is not a true statement.
