00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.450
The strategy we've been using to solve these problems is definitely useful, but

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.935
there are different interest options for Grant to explore. What if instead of

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:11.711
only compounding the interest once a year, his account compounded it twice a

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:18.736
year? Now, interest rate is still quoted as a yearly rate. So let's say he

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:23.721
keeps it at 3%. However, since his interest is going to be compounded twice a

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:27.808
year or semi-annually, then each time the compounding happens, the rate that's

00:00:27.808 --> 00:00:34.450
used is only going to be half of this annual rate. That means that each time we

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.170
do a calculation, we're not going to use the number 0.03 anymore, instead,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.791
we're going to use half of that. I'd like you to help me describe the situation

00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:49.330
by filling in some numbers for me in a few sentences. Here's what I'd like you

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.723
to tell me. If Grant invests $10,000 at a 3% annual rate compounded twice a

00:00:54.723 --> 00:01:03.465
year, then in six months, he will receive 1.5% on his $10,000 investment. Which

00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:07.686
means that some amount of money, which you'll write in here, will be added to

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:13.315
his account in interest. The total balance of the account will then be whatever

00:01:13.315 --> 00:01:18.771
you think. Then after six more months, Grant will again receive 1.5% interest,

00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:24.355
but this time, on the new amount. The interest added this time is going to be

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:28.643
something, which will make the total amount of money in the account after one

00:01:28.643 --> 00:01:31.521
year equal to what?
