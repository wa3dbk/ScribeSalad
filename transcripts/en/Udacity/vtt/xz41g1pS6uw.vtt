00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.340
Let's look at the solution
to our LRU quiz.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.550
We had this situation in the cache and
these counters before these accesses.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.250
And now we're performing accesses to A,
B, A, D, and K.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.390
A is the most recently used block.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.520
We reaccess it,
none of the counters change.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.680
We access B,
Bs counter becomes seven from three.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.730
That means that all the counters
above three will be decremented.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.500
Two stays the same.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.110
One stays the same.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.680
Zero stays the same.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.570
So these are the new
counters after Bs access.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.800
Next, we access A again,
this counter becomes 7.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.540
All the counters above
6 are decremented, so

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.610
this is really the only change.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.790
Now D is accessed,
this counter becomes 7.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.810
Those above 5 are decremented.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.680
The remaining ones stay the same.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.238
All of these have been hit so far so

00:00:56.238 --> 00:00:59.810
nothing has changed in the cache we
still have exactly the same stuff there.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.670
The only change will be when
we access K which is in this.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.920
So now we need to choose who goes out.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.250
And the one that goes out is
the one whose counter is zero.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.750
So H is replaced by K.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.960
The other blocks are remain
the same as they were and

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.850
this is the final answer for this quiz.
