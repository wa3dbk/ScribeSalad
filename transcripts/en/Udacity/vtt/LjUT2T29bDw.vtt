00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.270
The aria design practices' advice for
the radio group Pattern notes.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.050
It is recommended that both the radio
group and the radio button have a label

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.810
that is visible and referenced
using the aria-labelledby property.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.175
And use an aria-describedby property to
add additional information to the radio

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:18.442
buttons or radio group.

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:21.090
Aria provides several mechanisms for
adding labels and

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.810
descriptions to elements.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.250
In fact, aria is the only way to add
accessible help or description text.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.510
Let's take a look at the properties
aria provides to enable us to create

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.309
accessible labels.

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.435
Aria-label allows us to specify
a string directly to be

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.645
used as the accessible label.

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:40.995
One situation in which you might use an
aria-label attribute is where you have

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:44.897
some kind of visual indication
as to the purpose of an element.

00:00:44.897 --> 00:00:46.867
But still need to clarify that for

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:50.037
anyone who might not be able to
access that visual indication,

00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:53.197
such as a button which uses
a graphic to indicate its purpose.

00:00:53.197 --> 00:00:57.887
This overrides any other native labeling
mechanism such as a label element.

00:00:57.887 --> 00:01:02.781
Or for example, if a button has both
text content and an aria-label,

00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:05.627
only the aria-label value will be used.

00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:09.690
Aria-labelledby allows us
to specify an element ID

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.725
to refer to another element in
the dumb as this element's label.

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:16.449
Aria-labelledby is much like we're
using a label element with some key

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:17.275
differences.

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:20.825
Aria-labelledby may be
used on any element.

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:25.395
Aria-labelledby is much like using a
label element with some key differences.

00:01:25.395 --> 00:01:30.020
Aria-labelledby may be used on any
element, not just labellable elements.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.100
While a label element refers
to the thing it labels,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.680
the relationship is reversed
in the case of aria-laelledby.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.880
The thing which is labeled refers
to the thing which labels it.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.445
Since aria only affects
the accessibility tree,

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:46.460
aria-laelledby by does not
give you the nice label

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.705
clicking behavior you get
from the label element.

00:01:48.705 --> 00:01:51.830
Aria-labelledby can take a list

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.440
of ID refs to compose a label
out of multiple elements.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.800
The label will be concatenated in
the order the ID refs are given.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.840
And aria-labelledby can refer
to elements which are otherwise

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.365
hidden from assistive technology.

00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:09.199
Aria-labelledby overrides all
other name sources for an element.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:14.060
So for example, if something has both
an aria-labelledby and an aria label.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.703
Or an aria-labelledby and
a native HTML label,

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.930
the aria-labelledby label
will always take precedence.
