00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.470
The answer is that the RAM is just going to take a single time step, one time step,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.460
to execute these 2-lines of code because for this line up here--this is just a memory access

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.060
and we get memory access for free.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.420
That's 0 steps and down here, that is a simple operation, which takes one time step.

00:00:19.420 --> 99:59:59.000
So a total of one time steps.
