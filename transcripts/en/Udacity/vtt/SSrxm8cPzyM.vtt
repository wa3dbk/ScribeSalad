00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.530
So bc was an example of
a line oriented program, but

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.400
not every program we use in
the terminal works this way.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.530
You've already seen one
program that doesn't.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.920
The man program, for reading the manual
takes up a full terminal screen.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.500
It's actually use another program called
less that knows how to display text

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.190
one page at a time.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.280
So when you press Q to stop
looking at a manual page.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.100
You're actually using a command
that less understands.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.700
And you can use less to display any
file you like not just man pages.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.460
Let's try using less
on a long text file.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.305
Remember to use tab completion when
entering a long filename like this one.

00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:39.485
Scrolling up and down with arrow keys
works the same way as it did before, and

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:43.645
man you can also scroll down a page
at a time by using the D key or

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:45.165
by hitting the Space Bar.

00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:48.104
You can scroll up one page
at a time wit a U key.

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:50.072
If you want to skip to very
last line of the file,

00:00:50.072 --> 00:00:52.730
you can use the right angle bracket for
that.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.911
To get back up to the first line
use the left angle bracket.

00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:58.935
You can go to a particular line
by typing its line number and

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:00.590
hitting Enter.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.650
This is particularly useful when working
with source code where you know the line

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.590
numbers of important lines.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.250
It's also useful when you decide to
quickly move to the middle of a file.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.296
Less also has built-in search.

00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:14.580
Type slash and then the string
you'd like to search for.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.540
Press Enter or
return to execute the search.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.930
You can find the next occurrence
of the search term by pressing n.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.160
To go back to the previous occurrence,
use capital N.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.180
Search terms are case sensitive.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.950
Searching for otter with a lower case o,
won't find any capital O otters.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.550
If you're familiar with regular
expressions you can use them here,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.870
unless the search is actually looking
for lines that match your pattern.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.800
If you don't know regular expressions,
you can still use lesson search

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.420
capability, but you should be
careful and only search for

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.900
patterns consisting of numbers and
letters.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.600
The regular expression library will
interpret other characters in ways you

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.310
might not expect.
