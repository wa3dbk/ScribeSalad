00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Obviously, the mean is 5.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
When you sum up the squares, here the difference is -2² would be 4.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It'd be 1 over here--0, 1, 4.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You get 10, but you're going to compute the average distance, which is 10/5--that's 2.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The square root of this is about 1.414.
