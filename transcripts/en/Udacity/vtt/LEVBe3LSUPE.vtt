00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So here's my assignment for you.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Go online and check old news articles and find me one that takes data that show a correlation

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and from the data suggests causation or differently it tells what you what to do.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I argue with the news is full of this abuses of statistics and we will talk later about

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
how to set up a study to avoid this trap, but in your assignment if you find an article that has this

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
property extract that text and post it to the discussion forum.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I will be monitoring and comment on those and I want all of us to enjoy what kind of hilarious

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
funny misinterpretations of statistics you can find that people confuse correlation and causation

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So go ahead and find me interesting articles. Thank you!
