00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.643
We see in our equation that b as in y equals mx plus b, is the number 10. So

00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:09.470
this is the y coordinate of the y intercept. Since the y intercept has to lie

00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:14.326
along the y axis, its x coordinate must be 0. So the y intercept is at 0, 10.

00:00:14.434 --> 00:00:19.508
Let's graph that. It should be right around here. Equidistance between 8 and 12.
