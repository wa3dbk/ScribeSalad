00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.170
The process of bootstrapping
is probably different for

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.400
every individual or
business that's trying to do it.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.301
But in essence, I think it breaks
down into a few core phases.

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:12.960
One, identification of need.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.457
I need money, or I need this thing.

00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:16.758
I need this value.

00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:20.167
Once you've identified what that is,
that kind of turns into your goal.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:23.840
And then it's what do I have that
can help me get that thing that I've

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.204
identified that I need?

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:28.774
So if it's money I maybe
need more customers.

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:30.530
How do I get more customers?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.170
Well, I have this stuff
that's in my inventory or

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.610
I have the skill that I can apply or

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.020
I have this resource that I can break
down into smaller pieces and sell.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.900
Something that you have at your
disposal already that you can then

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.200
scale its value rapidly.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.475
And then it's the act of actually
doing that and following through and

00:00:54.475 --> 00:00:58.410
while doing that figuring out how to
turn it into a sustainable offering so

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.790
that way it doesn't
just die out over time.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.608
So to summarize it's three phases,
identification of problem,

00:01:04.608 --> 00:01:07.609
location and
allocation of immediate resources and

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.905
the third thing that's important that
kind of encompasses the other two is

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:15.337
figuring out the longevity of
whatever it is you've done.

00:01:15.337 --> 00:01:19.994
Summary of bootstrapping is
identifying what do you want.

00:01:19.994 --> 00:01:20.783
What's your goal?

00:01:20.783 --> 00:01:22.911
What is the thing that you
were trying to achieve?

00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:26.850
Second thing is looking for
that item or skill or talent or

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.884
resource that thing that will
generate the value for you.

00:01:30.884 --> 00:01:35.162
And the third thing is identifying how
you can turn that into a sustainable

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:38.130
platform to continue that
growth into the future.
