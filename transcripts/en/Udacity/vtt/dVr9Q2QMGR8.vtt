00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.670
So far we've explored the idea that we
should prefer heavier augmenting paths.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.680
It turns out that the idea
of using shorter paths

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.340
also gives rise to
an efficient algorithm.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.100
This is the Edmonds-Karp algorithm,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.980
also discovered independently
by Dinitz in the Soviet Union.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.700
Again, this is exactly
the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.260
only we are sure to choose
a minimum length path.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.280
The cost of an iteration is order E,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.130
as always, as we just use breadth-first
search to find the shortest s-t path.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.020
If we can bound the number
of iterations, most likely

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.980
we'll have a better bound than we did
for the naive version of Ford-Fulkerson.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.960
Indeed, we will be able to bound
the number of iterations here

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.290
as order E times V.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.910
And this, then, will enable us to argue
that Edmonds-Karp returns a maximum flow

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.440
in time E squared V.
