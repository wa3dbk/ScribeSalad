00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.574
In this unit, we're going to look at some of the core ideas behind interactive

00:00:03.574 --> 00:00:07.580
rendering. First, I'll discuss interactivity, and explain concepts such as the

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.325
refresh rate and frames per second. I'll next talk about the human eye and how a

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:15.484
camera works. These both relate to the idea of defining a view frustum as a way

00:00:15.484 --> 00:00:19.520
to see into a virtual world. I'll discuss how light travels in the real world

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.814
and how we simplify this physical process in our virtual world in order to

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:26.558
rapidly make pictures of it. In the latter half of this unit, I'll focus on what

00:00:26.558 --> 00:00:30.270
the graphics pipeline is and how graphics hardware is able to interactively

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.315
render complex scenes. I'll end by discussing two rendering algorithms, the

00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:36.412
painter's algorithm and the Z-Buffer.
