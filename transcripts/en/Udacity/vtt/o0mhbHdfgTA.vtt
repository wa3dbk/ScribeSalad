00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.510
So a different kind of partitioning
strategy is known as multi-level graph

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.400
coarsening.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.780
It's a form of divide and conquer.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.140
Let's start with
a conceptual illustration.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.010
You start with an imput graph,
pretend this is an input graph.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.820
You would then replace it
with a smaller version.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.580
In the graph sense, the coarse graph
would have fewer nodes and edges, but

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.290
would somehow look like
the original graph.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.740
We might repeat this a few times until
you get a version of the graph that is

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.820
small enough to partition quickly.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.260
You then partition the smallest graph.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.630
If you've done a good job preserving the
relationship between the coarsest graph

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.732
and its parent graph,
then a split in the course graph will

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:41.979
correspond to a roughly equivalent
split in the fine graph.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:46.050
And you'd repeat this reverse step until
you have a partition of the original.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.790
So that's the concept, but
how do you actually coarsen a graph?

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.350
Most schemes have the following flavor.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.860
First, identify at least one subset of
the vertices to collapse or to merge.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.490
For instance,
here's a subset of five vertices.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.690
I'm going to replace this subset
with a single super vertex.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.980
Now remember that one of your
partitioning goals is to obtain balanced

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.240
partitions.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.000
So it's probably a good
idea to track the fact

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.580
that there were five vertices
here that became one vertex.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.040
An easy way to do that is to assign
a weight of 5 to the super vertex.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.358
You'll also want to
track edge weights so

00:01:22.358 --> 00:01:24.754
that later on we can
cut edges accurately.

00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:26.660
Let's see how that might work.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.710
Consider two vertices
in a weighted graph.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.000
Remember, even if the original graph
is unweighted, we repeatedly coarsen by

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.990
aggregating nodes and edges and
so will accumulate weights.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.030
In this example, wi is a function that
maps every vertex to some weight.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.410
Similarly, the function xi
will map edges to weights.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.510
Now, let's suppose that we join just
these two vertices into a super-vertex.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.800
Let's call this new vertex s.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.060
Its weight is the sum of
the weights of u and v.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.010
Now, what about the edge weights?

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.710
The main case to think
about is the following.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.300
Suppose there's a vertex t that's
connected to both u and v.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.979
Then these two edges will
become a single super-edge

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.880
in the coarsened graph.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.740
So what is its weight?

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.600
A natural idea is simply to sum
the weights of the original edges.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.570
So the weight of the new edge
is just the weight of the two

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.740
old edges that got merged.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.370
The reason we do this is so
that if we partition or cut this edge in

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.590
the coarsened graph, we'll know that it
maps to two edges in the original graph.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.460
Now before you move on,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.040
it's a good idea to check that
this procedure makes sense to you.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.350
Okay, let's go back to
the original sample graph and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.310
see what would happen by
applying these rules.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.860
Consider this first merge group again.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.400
There are 5 vertices,
which become 1 super-vertex.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.270
There are also several cases in
which multiple edges should merge.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.400
Here is the result.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.320
Now, let's suppose someone gives
us a sequence of merge groups, and

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.586
let's coarsen the graph accordingly.

00:03:02.586 --> 00:03:08.868
[SOUND] Coarsen, coarsen.

00:03:08.868 --> 00:03:17.574
[SOUND] So this is the final result.

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:20.338
That's the basic process
of coarsening a graph.

00:03:20.338 --> 00:03:23.576
This final result kind of
looks like something.

00:03:23.576 --> 00:03:27.674
Oink, do you know about
Atlanta's PINK PIG ride?
