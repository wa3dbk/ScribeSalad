00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.300
So, in summary, what we discussed in this lecture was some of the foundations of

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.160
how a camera works, presented the concept of a pinhole camera, and

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.870
then basically introduced the concept of optics, and

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.520
how lenses can be used, and what role they play in ma, making a camera.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.370
And how they used to be able to generate images that could be

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.980
stored within a camera.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.080
What we will do now is building on these concepts, we'll look at focal length,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.880
aperture, if you recall aperture was nothing else but

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.360
the pinhole size, and also we'll add things like what a shutter,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.130
that is how long the opening is, the light opening is used to generate an image.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.060
And then we'll actually talk about how sensors are used to be able to

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.570
store those images.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.300
For additional references, I've listed two books here and

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.520
also additional material is available on some of the sites listed here, and

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.620
I'll be providing more resources on the website.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.650
And thanks to Mark Levoy,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.840
whose slides some of cost slide concepts were used in making these slides.
