00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.690
Let's talk a little bit about some of the specifics for

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.190
data modeling in JSON. First thing we should mention, is that

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.570
items may have different fields. So you notice there, that for

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.920
the certifications that actually had a multiplier, we included that multiplier.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.790
In the case of Hard Days Night, it was four. But

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.380
for those that don't actually have a multiplier, we simply left

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.450
that field out. And as we just discussed, JSON objects may

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.360
have nested objects. That is, fields may have values which are themselves

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.350
JSON objects. We can also nest arrays. So, a field may have a value of an

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.930
array, and that array may have as it's

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.920
elements other JSON objects, individual values, or other arrays.
