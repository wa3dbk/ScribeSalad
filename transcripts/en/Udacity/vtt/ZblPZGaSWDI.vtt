00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.573
Scientific notation is written in a very specific form. So people all over the

00:00:04.573 --> 00:00:09.833
world can compare numbers that are really large or really small. That form is a

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:15.430
times 10 to the b. Note this x here denotes mulitiplication. It is not a

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.966
variable. This formula requires that this first number here is a number between

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:27.022
1, which included, and 10, not included. And then this is multiplied by integer

00:00:27.022 --> 00:00:32.072
power of 10. So an example of something like this would be 5.6 times 10 to the

00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:38.129
2. Notice that 5.6 is in fact a number between 1 and 10. This is something we

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.937
need to be very careful about. And it's easy to make a mistake. For example, we

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:46.058
can make one very small change. If instead, we have 56 times 10 to the 2, we

00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:52.910
are no longer writing in scientific notation. 56 is not between 1 and 10. Now

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.394
I'm going to write down several numbers. And I'd like you to tell me, which of

00:00:56.394 --> 00:01:01.168
them are not written in the proper form for scientific notation? We have 5

00:01:01.168 --> 00:01:06.902
times 10 to the 12th, 6.543 times 10 to the negative 4, 6 times 10 to the 6.5,

00:01:06.902 --> 00:01:16.033
1.2 times 100 to the 4th, 0.5 times 10 to 3rd, 4 times 2 to the 6th. And last

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:20.583
but not least, 325 times 10 to the negative 7.
