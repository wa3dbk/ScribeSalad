00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.330
Choosing the right data types for your variables can

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.820
make or break your programs. We've prepared a fact

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.760
sheet on numbers for you that tells you what

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.650
number can be represented in each type. Check out the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.344
link below and then write variable declarations for each of these variables by

00:00:13.344 --> 00:00:18.660
matching them with a type and a literal. Write an appropriate type: int, long,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.459
or double in these boxes. And an appropriate literal: 123,

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:30.750
1.23E2, 123L, or 123., in each of these boxes. There

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.610
may be more than one right answer for some of these.
