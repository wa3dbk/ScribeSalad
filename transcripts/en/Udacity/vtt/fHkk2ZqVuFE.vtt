00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.304
As a challenge problem to you, try and write this expression using only one

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:10.675
logarithm. Your answer should be in the form log of base b of some expression.

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:15.539
Whatever this expression is, should involve the variables x, y, the number 5

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.735
and the other variable t. Now, there won't be a solution here since this is a

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:24.110
challenge question, but I hope you figure it out.
