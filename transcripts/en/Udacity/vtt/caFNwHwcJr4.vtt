00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.140
So in this lesson we've discussed some very important ideas about motivation

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.915
and emotion. So in motivation we've seen how needs states lead to drive and

00:00:08.915 --> 00:00:15.100
then those drives lead to motivated behaviors. We've also discussed how these

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.565
could be arranged in hierarchy from the most basic, like physiological and

00:00:18.565 --> 00:00:24.030
safety needs. All the way up to higher level needs of self-esteem and

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.241
self-actuaization. We've also talked about incentives, and how incentives are

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:36.225
important rewards for doing things well. We've talked about two basic needs.

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:41.166
Sex, and hunger. And sex is about survival of the species, hunger is about

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:46.410
survival of the individual. And with sex we've seen, for instance, the brain

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.052
system that regulates it is the hypothalamus. And the hormones involved in

00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:56.732
regulating sexual behavior are mostly testosterone. Likewise, with hunger we've

00:00:56.732 --> 00:01:01.331
seen how the brain, again the hypothalamus, regulates hunger as well as the

00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:07.823
blood, glucose levels and then finally, again, hormones. But this time, leptin,

00:01:07.823 --> 00:01:12.934
ghrelin, and insulin, for example. And then we've also seen how culture very

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:17.230
much shapes what we eat. And we call that cuisine. So we've also talked about

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.858
emotion. And emotions are experienced when we think of something as both

00:01:20.858 --> 00:01:25.859
meaningful and harmful or beneficial to our well being. In another words, how

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.835
we praise events shape the emotions we experience. So for instance, if we think

00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:35.377
something has been lost we might experience the emotion of sadness. If we think

00:01:35.377 --> 00:01:38.769
something is a threat to us, we might experience the emotion of either fear or

00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:43.594
anger. Emotions are accompanied by changes in our physiology, in our

00:01:43.594 --> 00:01:48.849
expression. And in our feeling states. Now emotions and moods, are not the

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:53.635
same. Emotions are a result from specific events, and they tend to be very

00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:58.768
short, in duration. Moods, on the other hand are often come about from

00:01:58.768 --> 00:02:05.104
something very vague, and they're much more longer lasting. And then affective

00:02:05.104 --> 00:02:10.443
traits are personality dispositions. So some people are more likely to

00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:16.771
experience anger, and sadness, or anxiety, for instance. And then, lastly we've

00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:20.547
talked about how the stereotypes of men and women being different in emotion

00:02:20.547 --> 00:02:25.577
are not really all that true. A lot of the time, men and women in fact express

00:02:25.577 --> 00:02:30.760
emotion very much the same way. We did see however, that women are better at

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.785
talking about emotion precisely and also reading emotion on people's faces and

00:02:35.785 --> 00:02:38.610
in their voices.
