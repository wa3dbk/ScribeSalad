00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
Let's start off with the domain. Our lowest x coordinate of any point on the

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.960
green curve is over here at negative 8. And we can see that this dot is filled

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.435
in, so we need an inclusive bracket there. The highest in x that we'd move is

00:00:13.435 --> 00:00:17.950
over here but we have an open circle at x equals 9. Since we write a 9, but we

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.634
write an open bracket to show that 9 is not included. So, now for the range.

00:00:22.634 --> 00:00:27.595
Let's look at the graph from this direction, then. The smallest value for f of x

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:32.395
for any of the given inputs that are possible, in this function is -3, and that

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:37.358
point is not included because of the open circle. The highest value for y is at

00:00:37.358 --> 00:00:43.745
y equals 9. So our range, then, goes from -3 to 9, not including negative 3, but

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:44.894
including 9.
