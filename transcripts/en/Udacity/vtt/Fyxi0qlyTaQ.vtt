00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.047
Organisations have been generating
data since way back

00:00:03.248 --> 00:00:06.352
But as time goes on, more &amp; more 
data is being generated.

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:11.617
IBM estimates that 90% of world's data
was created in the last two years alone.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.465
This is a simple example.
Think of your cellphone.

00:00:14.578 --> 00:00:17.847
Whenever your cellphone is turned on,
it's connected to the cell towers.

00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:20.034
As you move around,
it'll connect to different towers

00:00:20.132 --> 00:00:21.522
in a different signal streaks.

00:00:21.743 --> 00:00:25.556
All of that connection data is collected
by the phone company &amp; it's being logged.

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:28.495
They can use that information to find 
dead spots in the coverage

00:00:28.683 --> 00:00:31.808
&amp; know which towers are busiest &amp; 
need increased capacity.

00:00:31.928 --> 00:00:35.112
They can even trace you if you make an
emergency phone call but

00:00:35.112 --> 00:00:36.944
don't get your exact location.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.573
This is an enormous amount 
of data we have.

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:42.641
Another example as when you visit a 
website like Amazon or Netflix,

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.260
everything, you do there is logged: what
pages you view, how long you spend there,

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:50.181
where you coming from.

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:53.287
They can even capture things like what 
browser you are using.

00:00:53.472 --> 00:00:55.344
Again this is a huge amount of data.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.656
Phone data &amp; website logs are just examples.

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:02.556
In addition, things like X-rays are 
creating huge amounts of data.

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:05.836
&amp; people doing research to detect 
similarities in tumors.

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:09.691
The increase in amount of data we're 
generating opens up huge possibilities.

00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:11.638
But it comes with problems too.

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:15.410
Where do we've to store all this data?
&amp; process it too?
