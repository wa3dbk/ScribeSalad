00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.820
Here is a specific example of how
retention affects in-app purchases.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.790
This graph shows the amount of
in-app purchases by the hour for

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.270
the top 50 games in the Amazon App Store
right after they've been downloaded.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.950
So, this gives us a good idea of
what in-net purchases look like for

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.520
successful games over time.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.290
Look at the initial 24 hours.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.330
There's a big spike in in-app purchases.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.505
The first day is often where
players make the most purchases.

00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:35.327
In fact, most games make about
18% of all their in-app sales

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:38.998
from players buying items
within the first day.

00:00:38.998 --> 00:00:42.998
But that leaves 82% of in-app
sales coming from players

00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:45.550
who continue to buy over time.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.980
So even though this initial spike is
impressive, these smaller purchases that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.959
stay consistent are even more important
for your game to continue making money.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.304
These regular purchases also mean
that players like your game.

00:00:58.304 --> 00:01:03.440
They are playing your game everyday and
willing to pay for it bit by bit.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.420
The bottom line is that the longer
someone stays engaged and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.840
plays your game,
the more money it will make.
