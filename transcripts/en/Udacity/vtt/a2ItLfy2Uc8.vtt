00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now that we have an understanding of formal grammars,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we're going to need to use them to understand or describe HTML and JavaScript.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We're going to design together formal grammars that exactly capture HTML and JavaScript

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or at least interesting subsets of them.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If we were trying to understand English sentences,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
there is a special kind of diagram we could make.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here I have a very high level partial grammar for English.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
A sentence has a noun phrase, a verb phrase, and an object.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
A noun phrase is just a decorated noun, like maybe a noun with an adjective in front of it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
A verb phrase is a decorated verb, maybe a verb with an adverb in front of it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Then the object could be a noun phrase or a noun or something more complicated.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
For example, here is a sentence: "Wes reads Romance of the Three Kingdoms."

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now, there are various different ways to diagram English sentences.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We'll do something relatively simple.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We just want to indicate which part matches which grammatical form.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Our noun phrase is going to be "Wes." Our verb phrase is "reads."

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The object is "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We could divide it up so that the object falls under the phrase

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
or that we draw these slightly differently, but mostly we want to know which part goes where.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Who is doing the reading? Is it Wes or the book.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This sort or diagram will help us figure that out.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In fact, in formal languages or with a grammar like this,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
there is a more common way, a more pictoral way of representing these sentences.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We can draw something that looks a bit like an inverted tree.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm going to take each one of these productive rules

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and puts its left hand-side at the top,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and then give it children, or branches, based on which rule is chosen

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and what's available on the right.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Here we have a sort of a pyramid-like shape, or what's officially called a parse tree.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Remember that syntactic analysis is sometimes called parsing.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This might not look like a tree, but what you want to do

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
is imagine the tree growing upside down.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Here is our tree, and at various places--although it's starting with the trunk or the root--

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
it branches out, and all of these intermediate parts in the tree

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
represent none terminals in the grammar.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
All of the leaves right at the end represent terminals

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
or tokens in the final sentence or utterance.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This is called a parse tree by longstanding tradition.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We draw them upside down, starting at the root with the start nonterminal.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
While we're here, you too should consider reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Written in the 14th century, it's a Chinese historical novel

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
about the end of the Han Dynasty. Good stuff.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Here's one of our favorite grammars from before--a simple arithmetic expression grammar.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Let's say that our input is 1 plus 2 plus 3.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Here is a possible parse tree.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We start at the top, at the root, with our nonterminal expression.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Each time we have a number of children equal to the number of symbols

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
to the right of the arrow.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If I'm using expression goes to expression plus expression,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I have one node with three children.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I need to get 1 plus 2 plus 3, so I'm going to need to use this first rule

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
at least twice--once to get this plus sign and once to get that one.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Here I'm using it once--one instance of rule one.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Here I'm using it twice--another instance of rule one.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
You'll note that they overlap.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The first time we use this rule we started drawing this part of the tree.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
This expression node was the result.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
The second time, it was the thing we were choosing to expand.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
This is normal. This represents the recursive structure of a grammar.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
In a parse tree like this, these parts at the that have no children

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
are called "leaves."

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
The parts in the middle are called "nodes."

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Sometimes the leaves are called "leaf nodes," which is a bit ambiguous.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
These are always going to be terminals.

00:04:05.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The intermediate nodes are always going to be nonterminals.
