00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.939
Mean-shift is a method that's easiest
introduced, when we do segmentation.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.590
The idea is, in Mean-shift, is to
find the modes of a distribution, or

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.710
of a probability density.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.840
So, you remember, the modes are sort of,
the peaked areas, and

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.340
here's the basic underlying assumption.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.370
The assumption is, I've got a bunch of
samples, that have been drawn from some

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.430
probability distribution function,
and you want to find the modes.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.790
So, there's this beautiful couple of
beautiful examples out there on the Web,

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.610
feel free to steal whichever
one you want, I stole this one.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.850
So, here we have a set of particles, and
they're just drawn from some density.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.940
And probably,
if I were to ask you where's the mode?

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.460
You'd probably, say,
that it's somewhere around here.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.170
'Kay, and the goal is for
the system to find that on it's own.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.890
So, here we have, and again,
we have our sample, so

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.290
let's put down a region, okay?

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.470
It's called a Region of interest.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.405
Now, we're not going to talk about,
the size of that region just yet, or

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:52.295
its shape.

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:53.815
We'll talk about that,
a little bit later.

00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:57.555
It's going to be a Gaussian, but, for
now, it's just going to be a circle.

00:00:57.555 --> 00:01:00.315
So, we have this region, and
we calculate, okay, of all of

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:04.805
the points in that circle, where is
the mean, that's, or the center of mass?

00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:06.805
And we say, oh,
it's not right in the middle, and

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:10.815
that difference between them,
that's called the Mean Shift vector, so

00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:13.680
this is called the Mean Shift algorithm.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.830
Amazing huh?

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.470
And so, what do you do with
the Mean Shift vector?

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.591
Well, you shift the mean,
and there it go.

00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:21.850
[NOISE] Perfect.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.406
Okay?

00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:23.640
What do we do?

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.070
We do it again.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.300
Okay?
Here's where we are.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.020
Here's the, the weighted mean of the,
the new samples.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.440
There's our Mean Shift vector.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.150
What do we do?

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.215
We shift it again.

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:35.807
[NOISE] And we do it one more time.

00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:38.698
There it is, oh,
we're getting close now.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.140
Small Mean Shift vector, shift, and

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.950
then finally, guess what,
we are in the right spot.
