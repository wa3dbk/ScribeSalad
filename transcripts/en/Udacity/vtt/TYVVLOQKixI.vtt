00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.250
Let's look into whether debt
financing your business is the right

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:03.950
option for you.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.670
We'll first define debt financing,
then hear about the benefits and

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.690
downsides of choosing this option.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.910
So first, what is it?

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.760
Debt financing is basically any form of
loan you could get to help start your

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.650
business.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.420
Banks, lenders, or

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.440
any other source of income that you
need to pay back is all a form of debt.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.130
When using debt financing as an option,
the main thing to consider is that

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.080
you'll be paying back the loans you
get over an extended period of time.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.380
Each payment will include
a principal plus interest.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.090
The principal payment is the amount
that will go towards paying

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.600
the original loan amount.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.320
The interest charge will vary
depending on the loan, but

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.430
this is the amount you owe on top of
the principal payment as a fee for

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.690
borrowing money from your lender.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.970
There are a few benefits and downsides
to be aware of before considering

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.840
debt financing for your business.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.980
So first, what are some of the benefits?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.860
Let's overview three of them,
ownership, taxes, and interest rates.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.250
First ownership, when borrowing money
from a bank or any other lender for

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.870
your business, you have the same
agreement as with any other loan.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.080
You're agreeing to make your
payments on time, and that's it.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.910
From there, you can make whatever
decisions you want about your business,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.690
and the lender stays out of the way.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.240
This let's you get the money you need,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.501
while maintaining full
ownership of your business.

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:20.520
Next, taxes.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.110
When you get a loan for your business,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.900
the payments you make are considered
tax deductible business expenses.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.220
Tax laws vary widely based
on where you live and

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.780
may also be impacted by where you
choose to incorporate your business.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.860
This is a great way to minimize
the cost of any loan you accept.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.270
Just be sure to diligently
track your expenses or

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.530
get an accountant to make sure you're
getting the returns you should be.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.100
And finally, you can get lower interest
rates for your business loans.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.990
Look through any options you may have,
and choose the one that's best for

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.860
your business.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.780
This is a big decision.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.940
This can get pretty complicated, so
I suggest you consult with an accountant

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.360
before making any major decisions
like this for your startup.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.230
While there are some benefits to
debt financing, it's important to

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.090
understand some of the potential
downsides to choosing this option.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.760
Let's overview three major downsides,
repayment, unaffordable rates, and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.250
credit rating.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.120
First, repayment, when you take a loan,
you don't have to give up any control,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.570
but you will need to continue making
payments, possibly for a very long time.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.840
If your business doesn't work out, and
you aren't making profits to help make

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.630
these payments,
your lender still wants their money.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.980
Next, unaffordable rates,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.610
after considering your tax
deductions and discounts,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.620
you might still be getting a pretty
high interest rate from your lender.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.390
It's tough enough to run a business
without having to worry about making

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.840
an extra 20% interest on
top of your other expenses.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.710
And finally,
be careful about your credit rating.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.690
If you choose to take out a personal
loan, it may affect your credit score.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.320
Having extra marks on your credit score
makes you a bigger risk to your lender,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.500
and you'll end up paying for
that at even higher interest rates.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.960
One option to overcome this downside
is to obtain a business loan.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.560
It is more difficult due
to logistical issues, but

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.880
the advantage is that it won't
affect your personal credit score.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.210
While debt financing is possible,
it's a really tough way to go and

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.460
could be pretty devastating if
things don't go according to plan.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.050
It's best to validate the success of
your product by seeking investment or

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.900
by operating a business with personal
expenses you can afford to lose.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.540
If you decide debt
financing is right for

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.510
you, be very careful about how you plan
your business and do plenty of research.
