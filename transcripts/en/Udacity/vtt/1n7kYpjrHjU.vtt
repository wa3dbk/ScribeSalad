Hi, welcome back. So far in this class we covered

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.685
a lot of programming techniques, but we mostly

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:09.849
done it with small examples of code. In this unit,

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.612
we’re going to look at a larger example than

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:13.885
anything we seen before. We’re going to write

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:17.274
an algorithm for finding the highest scoring play

00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:20.547
in a crossword tile game. Now, versions of this

00:00:20.547 --> 00:00:22.965
game go by names like Scrabble and Words

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:25.240
with Friends. So we’re going to have to represent

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.545
everything about the words, the tiles, the board,

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:31.830
the scoring and the algorithm for finding the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.117
highest scoring word. That’s going to be more code

00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:37.052
I’m going to be writing a lot of it and you’re going to

00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:39.849
get practice reading, that’s an important skill but I’m

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:42.145
also going to stop and leave you plenty of places

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:44.838
where you can write some other code and at any

00:00:44.838 --> 00:00:47.302
point, if you want a bigger challenge, you can stop

00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:50.173
the video and go ahead yourself and try to solve as

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:52.942
much of it as you can on your own and I would

00:00:52.942 --> 00:00:56.329
encourage you to do that. This is a big step-up.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.225
I think you are all ready for it. So let’s get started.
