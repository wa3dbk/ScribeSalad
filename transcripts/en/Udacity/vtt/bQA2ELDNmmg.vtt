00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's now have some fun and apply this to an actual car problem.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The one I'll using is a bit simplified as always,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but it does relate to real world path planning as is done, for example, by Google Maps.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Suppose we have a car down here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This car now has its state an x, a y, and an orientation, theta.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:34.000
By orientation for simplicity is chosen from 4 possible directions--up, down, left, and right.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
As I quiz you in the beginning, I'd like to get to the location over here, facing left.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Realize that now the state space is 3-dimensional, just like in our localization example.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I now would like to implement a dynamic programming planner

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that gives me the optimal path for going from here to here

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and that let's me play with cost functions.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There are three principle actions.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
One is move in which the car just goes 1 grid cell forward in its present orientation.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It doesn't turn at all. That could be applied anywhere in the maze in any direction.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
One is turn left and then move.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This car in this position in the cell over here could chose

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
the turn left and move, which makes it move over here.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The last one is turn right and move,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in which case it would, from this cell over here,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
turn over here and head in this direction.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Here's our world again.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You can see there is a street over here that's navigable, one over here that's navigable.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You see the loop on the right side.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Remember that now this state space is 3-dimensional, not 2- dimensional.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Our goal is to move to cell [2, 0], which is the one over here.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Our initial state is up here,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and the initial state has not just a position of [4, 3] but also an orientation of 0.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's a 3-dimensional state.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Here are my orientations--0, 1, 2, and 3.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The first one makes the robot go up, the second go left,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
third one go down, and the fourth one go right.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Here are the names associated with it---up, left, down, and right.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This thing here is interesting.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
As actions, we have 3 actions.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We can add to the index orientation -1, 0, or 1.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
If we add -1 we jump 1 up in the cyclic array over here,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
which is the same as doing a right turn.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
For example, if you go from go left to go up, that the same as turning right.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
If we add +1, that's the same as turning left.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
If we leave the orientation unchanged,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
then we go straight, which is indicated by this hash symbol over here.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
These actions come with different costs.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Right now the left turn costs me 2, going straight costs me 1,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and going right costs me 1 as well, which, as we all know,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
makes the left turn the preferred solution over here.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Indeed, as I run it, you can see how the car turns left over here to the goal location.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If I were to increase the cost for the left action to 20, then my solution changes.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
You can see the car dashes straight ahead over here, turns right over here,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
right over here, right over here, and then goes straight to the goal location.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
That software I want you to implement. There is one more hint.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The value function itself is 3-dimensional, and here is the code that I've been using.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Not necessarily the most efficient, but it has inside 4 identical arrays

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
of the size of the grid concatenated into a megagrid

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and initialized all by a very large value--999 in this case.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
You need functions just like these, and it turns out this makes it more difficult to write the code.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
This is our last quiz in this lecture.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Our last programming assignment, and you might spend some time.

00:03:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
It took me a while to program it myself to get an output just like this over here.
