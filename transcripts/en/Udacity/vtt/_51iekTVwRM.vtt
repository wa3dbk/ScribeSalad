00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.019
So accelerators are interesting,
there are a lot of accelerators.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.760
There's accelerators that
universities have put together,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.430
that corporations have put together,
and then there's the sort of private

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.750
investment vehicle accelerators like
Y Combinator, and there's a lot of them.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.340
The interesting thing about
accelerators is the jury's still out

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.020
on the efficacy of accelerators.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.980
There's a huge question out there of, if
a company goes to an accelerator program

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.660
or doesn't go to an accelerator program,
what are the odds of success?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.300
Does an accelerate or
increase the likelihood of success?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.760
And there's a lot of research going on
in that at Yael Hochberg at MIT and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.430
Susan Cohen at the University of
Richmond are publishing all kinds of

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.540
papers, based on this
using crunch based data.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.450
And we saw a recent study from U.C.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.030
Berkeley, which showed that while
it's still difficult to tell whether

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.080
accelerators increase
the odds of success,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.510
one thing that accelerators are doing is
they're making companies fail faster.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.800
Because the mentors and the feedback
that the entrepreneurs are getting

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.720
help everybody understand,
is this a problem that's worth solving?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.890
Is this a business that's
going to make it or not?

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.520
And it's moving much faster within
the environment of an accelerator

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.830
versus outside of an accelerator.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.070
So that is something that
definitely has been proven thus.
