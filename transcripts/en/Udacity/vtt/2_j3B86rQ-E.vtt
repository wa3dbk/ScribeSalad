00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.021
So now it's time to cover the building blocks to use when doing datestore

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:08.581
modelling. They are kind, entity, and

00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:14.040
property. Let's start with kind shall we? A kind

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.780
is a name that defines a particular

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.500
structure. For our conference central application, two different

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.410
kinds are, for example, profile and conference.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.460
A kind is similar to the concept of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.230
classes in object oriented programming. Given a kind

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.650
you can create many entities of that kind, so

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.360
in this picture we can do three entities, one

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.710
for the profile kind and two for the conference

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.880
kind. And as you can see entities are very

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.990
similar to the concept of objects in object oriented

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.170
programming, and each entity holds a set of properties

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.570
which are highlighted by the red sections in this

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.460
picture, and by now you can see that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.830
properties are very similar to the concept of fields,

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.637
members, or attributes in object oriented programming. In

00:01:00.637 --> 00:01:03.257
fact, you can also find similarities with the relational

00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:05.620
of database modeling. Let's look at the table

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.820
that summarizes these things. So the kind in app

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.670
engine datastore can be thought of as a class

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.830
in object oriented programming and as a table in

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.405
relational database model, and an entity in app engine

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:21.750
datastore can be thought of as an object in

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.780
object oriented programming or as a row in relational

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.890
database modeling. And finally, a property in Datastore can

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.140
be thought of as a field or attribute in

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.250
object oriented programming, and that's a colomn, in relational

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.920
database modeling. But, this is on a very high

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.060
level. Since there are many things that differ in Datastore

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.930
compared to the other technologies, you shouldn't consider these

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.590
as direct technology. It could help you out in the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.200
beginning, but as we dig deeper into how data store

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.110
works, you will start to see more and more differences
