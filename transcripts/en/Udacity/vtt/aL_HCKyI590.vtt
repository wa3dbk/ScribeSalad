00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.720
Zeros can be any kind of complex number. Some of them are just real numbers,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.640
but some of them are complex numbers that have imaginary parts. Let us look at

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.920
a little bit more closely at the case where our zeros are not just real

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.419
numbers. When we looked at a quadratic equations, we found that if we had a

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.100
solution of x equals 2 plus 3 i, then it's complex conjugate was also a

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.877
solution. So, can you tell me what the complex conjugate of 2 plus 3 i is?
