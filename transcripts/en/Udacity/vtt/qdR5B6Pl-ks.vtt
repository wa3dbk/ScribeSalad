00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.300
Let's return to the Asteroids repository from the previous lesson.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.850
Do you remember the bug you saw, where you could shoot without a delay?

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.210
You now have the knowledge you need to fix that bug and commit your fix.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.910
First, I'll do a git log.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.740
Now, I'll scroll down to the commit where you found the bug had been introduced.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.060
You may recall that it was this commit.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.810
To double check, I'll use diff to compare it to the previous one.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.330
Sure enough, this commit removed the line, this.delayBeforeBullet = 10.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.890
I want to readd this line, so I'll go ahead and copy it.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.494
And I can see that it should be added inside the if statement,

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:36.150
this.delayBeforeBullet is less than or equal zero.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.890
I'll open game.js in Sublime.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.060
Search for delayBeforeBullet.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.330
And hit Find until I find the appropriate if statement.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.650
Here it is, so I'll insert the line.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.080
Now I'm ready to add the file to the staging area, and then commit it.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.340
First I'll use git status.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.160
And I can see that game.js has been modified, and that the changes

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.490
are not staged yet, which means that they are not in the staging area.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.660
Right now, I remember exactly what changes I've made to game.js since I

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.650
made them just a minute ago.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.890
But often, I'll find myself making changes, taking a break, and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.110
then coming back and forgetting what changes I've made.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.650
So I'm going to show you how to use git diff to see the exact changes that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.440
you've introduced since committing.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.665
To make the illustration more clear, I'm also going to introduce a change to

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.850
index.html that I don't want to commit yet.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.160
I'll just collapse this line onto the previous line.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.140
Let's think about what the working directory, staging area and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.800
repository look like right now.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.620
The repository contains several commits.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.340
And each commit contains several files.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.950
I'll focus on the most recent commit in the files game.js and index.html.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.590
The staging area is a copy of the most recent commit until I add changes to it,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.350
so it has those same files.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.960
Finally, the working directory also has the same files in it, but I've made

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.470
some updates to game.js and index.html, which I'll represent using these stars.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.400
You know that you can use git diff to compare two commits by

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.350
entering their commit ID's.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.570
But the staging area and

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.620
the working directory are not commits, so they don't have ID's.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.050
However, it's very common for Git users to want to compare the working

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.320
directory to the staging area, so git diff with no arguments will do that.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.010
This will show any changes you've made that you haven't added to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.640
the staging area yet.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.620
So I'll go ahead and

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.990
run git diff with no arguments, and I can see the two changes I just introduced.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.610
Here's the change to game.js, where I re-added the delayBeforeBullet.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.050
And here's the change to index.html, where I combined two lines into one.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.400
Now, I'll add game.js to the staging area and run git diff again.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.186
This time, I only see the changes to index.html,

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:50.960
since game.js is the same in the staging area and working directory now.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.940
Now, the staging area contains the updated version of game.js, but

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.990
not of index.html.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.840
That's why, when I used git diff to compare these two,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.770
I only saw the changes to index.html.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.990
Now, you might also want to view the difference between the staging area and

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.460
the most recent commit.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.640
I like to do this right before I commit, to double check that the files I've

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.160
added are really what I want to put in the commit.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.720
The command for this is git diff --staged.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.907
If I run this command now, I should see the changes to game.js, but

00:03:20.907 --> 00:03:25.160
not index.html, since index.html is still the same.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.870
Sure enough, git diff --staged shows only the change to game.js.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.810
This is exactly what I want to commit.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.640
So I'll go ahead and type git commit.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.790
And I'll use the message: Add delay back to bullets.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.700
Now, I'll run git diff again and

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.150
I'll still see the changes to index.html, since I haven't committed those.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.590
If I run git diff --staged though,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.170
I see nothing, since I did just commit everything in the staging area.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.210
Finally, I don't actually want these changes to index.html anymore.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.260
To get rid of them, I'll run git reset --hard.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.010
Which discards any changes in either the working directory or the staging area.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.660
But be very careful if you ever run this.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.900
Most actions in git are reversible,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.360
since you can always restore previous commits.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.130
But you've never committed the changes in your working directory or

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.390
staging area.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.230
So if you run this command, you can't get those changes back.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.070
In this case, I had just run both git diff and git diff -staged.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.120
So I know exactly what changes are in the working directory and

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.900
staging area, and I'm sure I don't want them anymore.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.850
Now I'll run git diff again.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.190
And there are no changes.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.990
What two versions of your files does each form of git diff compare?

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.930
For each form of git diff,

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.230
fill in the two versions that compares in these boxes.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.410
Each box should contain either working directory, staging area, commit one or

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.610
commit two.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.970
Note that commit one is the most recent commit in this repository
