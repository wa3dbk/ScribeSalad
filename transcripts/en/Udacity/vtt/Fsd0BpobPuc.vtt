00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:06.205
So, how did you do? The correct answer is 3 times 2x minus y times 3x minus 5.

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:10.050
Let's see how we got that answer. Whenever I see a four term polynomial, I know

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.560
I want to use factoring by grouping. But remember the first step in any

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.582
factoring problem is to look for a GCF. In this case, when I look at the four

00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:24.952
terms, I know that it has a GCF of 3. So I'm going to factor out the GCF from

00:00:24.952 --> 00:00:30.236
these four terms. So, when I factor out a 3, I'm left with 6x squared minus 3xy

00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:34.980
minus 10x plus 5y. Now, I'm going to try to factor out what's left inside the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.476
parentheses. When I factor by grouping, I want to find the GCF of the first 2

00:00:40.476 --> 00:00:46.385
terms, which is 6x squared minus 3xy. The GCF of these first 2 terms is 3x. When

00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:54.850
I factor a 3x out, I'm left with 2x. 3x times 2x is 6x squared minus y. 3x times

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.800
negative y gives me negative 3xy. The next thing I want to do is factor out the

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.060
GCF of the second 2 terms. Now, you have to be careful here. We know we want the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.171
second binomial to be 2x minus y over here. But right now, we have negative 10x

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:16.318
plus y. This is one of the cases we need to factor out the negative. The GCF of

00:01:16.318 --> 00:01:22.676
10x and 5y is going to be negative 5. The reason I factor out the negative is

00:01:22.676 --> 00:01:30.334
because I want positive 2x. Negative 5 times 2x gives me negative 10x and

00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:38.363
negative 5 times negative y gives me 5y. Because negative 5 times 2x is negative

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:44.096
10x. And negative 5 times negative y gives me positive 5y. My next step is to

00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:51.245
factor out the GCF of the two terms inside the parentheses. Remember to carry

00:01:51.245 --> 00:02:00.390
along the three, and I'm left with 2x minus y, times 3x minus 5. And these

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.789
second pair of parentheses is redundant. So I can just write 3 times 2x minus y

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:12.568
times 3x minus 5. Did you get that? Well done. Let's learn more about factoring.
