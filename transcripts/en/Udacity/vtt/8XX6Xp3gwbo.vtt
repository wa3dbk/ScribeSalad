00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.070
So that ends our,
our discussion on direct depth sensing.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.490
Probably six, seven years ago,

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.340
I wouldn't have even mentioned it
anymore because light striping was sort

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.080
of relegated to sort of
assembly line machine vision.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.670
But with the advent of the Kinect and
other types of such sensors, and really,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.690
robotics putting geometry back as
a first class computer vision problem.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.880
Depth sensing has become
a big deal again.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.230
And since many of the manipulations
are similar to what we do with images,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.220
it made sense to consider
it within computer vision.
