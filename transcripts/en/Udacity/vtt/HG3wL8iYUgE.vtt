Let's return to our Alice in Wonderland example for a minute. What if I want to

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:07.310
write a program that finds interesting words that occur in the book? A lot of

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.673
the time shorter words are more common words. Maybe longer words are more

00:00:11.673 --> 00:00:15.860
interesting, and more likely to be related to the exact topic of the book. We

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.664
could write a program that would help us test this. Let's write a program that

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:23.615
finds the first word in Alice in Wonderland that's longer than nine characters.
