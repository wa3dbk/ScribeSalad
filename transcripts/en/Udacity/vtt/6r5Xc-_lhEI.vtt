00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.698
So let's take a look at the use of operators to

00:00:02.698 --> 00:00:06.155
support Range Queries. Let me show you what I mean. MongoDB

00:00:06.155 --> 00:00:09.809
provides several inequality operators that enable us to perform this type

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.720
of query. The inequality operators we may use include greater than,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.000
less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.530
to, or not equal to. There are also a couple that

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.520
are designed for querying array fields. We'll talk about those in

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.170
a later lesson. Now let's look at some queries against our cities

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.530
collection that provide examples of using inequality operators. Okay.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.980
So imagine that we want to query for all

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.850
cities with the population greater than a quarter million.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.810
Instead of specifying an exact number here, as the value

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.030
for our query document, which is going to be passed

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.090
to find here, or instead going to use the greater

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.654
than operator and the value of population in a

00:00:47.654 --> 00:00:50.540
query document it's going to be a sub document using

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.986
that operator. We can specify a more constrained range

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:57.070
for a query like this using an additional operator.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.560
Now this example is very similar to what we

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.970
just looked at, the only difference being that in the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.099
value for population in our query document we're specifying

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.320
an additional operator of less than or equal to 500,000.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.430
Thus defining a more constrained range for this query

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.970
here. Now this type of range based query works across

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.680
many different data types. We can do something

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.070
similar for strings. So here, the semantics of this

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.350
range are give us all city names that begin

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.670
with x. Let's go ahead and run this code.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.270
And here we can see that in the results we

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.160
get back. Looks like we're getting back cities that just begin

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.920
with the letter X. Total match of 22 cities out of

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.130
the 20,000 or so that are in this collection. Okay, let's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.610
look at our code again. We can also do this

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.170
type of query against dates. Here we're specifying a Python date

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.160
as the lower and upper bound, and so here we're looking

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.940
for all cities that have a founding date sometime in the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.810
year 1837. And actually, to be precise here, we should really have

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.440
this be greater than or equal to. Okay, now let's run this.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.500
Okay, and we get three cities that match. We can see that the founding date here

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.970
seems to be within range, as it is here, and also here, for the city of

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.330
Chicago. Finally, we can also do things like

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.800
use the not equals operator to for example

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.700
in this case, find all cities with a

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.940
country that's not equal to the United States.
