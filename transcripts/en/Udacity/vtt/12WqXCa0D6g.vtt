00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So we had these app servers that were all running their own caches,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and then we had a couple databases that were all replicas of each other.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
At this point we added a load balancer, and this load balancer probably actually ran.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It was probably a program running on one of these app machines,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and these guys were still keeping their caches in sync using interacting with the databases directly.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And we had a limit ot how many app servers we can have because we had this complicated caching spread thing.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The next thing we added was the memcache layer.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So instead of these app services containing their end memory cache,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
they would communicate via memcache.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So instead of having to keep their cache in sync, we just had 1 cache that was just shared among all of our app servers.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm sad it took us so long to figure this out because memcache existed when we started reddit,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and we should have been using it from the beginning.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is what allowed us to get all of that state, all of that cache, out of the apps and into memcached

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and allowed us to add apps arbitrarily.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Once we had that going, that allowed us to scale our apps

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and they stayed in sync, and so we can add an app, lose an app. We didn't have to worry about it.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The next thing we had to start 
dealing with was the database load.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So we're already replicating for kind of 
durability and for performance reasons,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
so we can spread our reads across multiple 
machines as we started segmenting on type.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So we'd have a database for just links; then we could separate comments out into its own database.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And so these would still replicate to each other, but if you're only submitting a link,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
you only have to touch this database, 
and if you're only, like, reading a comment,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
for example, you only have to touch this database.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And this is actually still basically the general setup reddit has today in terms of how the database is scaled.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And we never wrote sharding in the beginning, and I really regret that.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
When I rewrote the ThingDB, the second version of it, I had in the back of my head,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
you know, I should add sharding, because we're going to need that someday.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And then I just wanted to get the damn thing into production so I stopped.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The big lession I've learned is when
you're writing a big system like that,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
if you don't do the hard parts up front, you may never get another opportunity to them,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
because now the database is so big, that if we wanted to bolt on sharding, that's a huge project.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It's easier right now to just add bigger machines and more caching.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It's not going to work forever, and somebody's going to have to bite the bullet and do that.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And it would have been a lot easier to do it at the time.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Since all of our queries, we stopped using joins when we switched to ThingDB,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
sharding's actually fairly straightforward if you kind of do it right from the beginning.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Over time some of the software on these app servers changed so we've always been using Python.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I don't remember what app server we used originally.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We switched from whatever we used initially to web.py, which is a framework that we wrote at reddit.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Aaron was basically the main author of that, and it's still out there on the Internet somewhere.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And this is where the first time I recall seeing a framework that had kind of the notion

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
of a handler class and then functions for get and post,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and I've become kind of addicted to thinking of web applications that way.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Actually the Google app engine, the webapp2 framework,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
inherited a lot of that design from web.py, which is nice.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Nice for me, at least, is that design decision has kind of stuck around for a little while

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
so I think that means it was a good one.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now Python uses a web framer called Pylons, but it uses a very old version of Pylons.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And basically when we switched to Pylons, Aaron had stopped maintaining web.py.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I didn't want to maintain it. We switched to something else maintained by somebody else.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And then we basically shredded most of it and made it function just like web.py.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
In hindsight we probably should have just written our own because that's effectively what we did,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but we did it on top of Pylons.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So if you want to use the reddit version of Pylons, it's open source. It's online.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
But it doesn't resemble anything like the actual Pylons web framework at this point.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And to my knowledge, that's still what they use today, this hacked up version of Pylons.
