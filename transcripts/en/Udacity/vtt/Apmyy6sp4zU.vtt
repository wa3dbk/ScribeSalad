We just saw that because of Polymorphism, one can write a program that can

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.670
handle any mix of quiz questions. Let's try that out and develop another

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.496
question type. A numeric question expects an answer from the user that is a

00:00:11.496 --> 00:00:16.341
number. For example here we ask what is the area of a circle with radius one.

00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:19.330
And the answer is of course pi, but that might be hard to enter, and we can't

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.368
really expect the user to type in the exact value of pi, and as you know, this

00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:28.135
is not even the exact value, either. It goes on forever. We just want the user

00:00:28.135 --> 00:00:33.575
to be able to enter, say, 3.14 or 3.14159, depending on how well they remember

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:39.506
those digits. Either one of those answers should be fine. In fact, we'll take

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:43.166
any answer, that's up to point oh one away, from the answer, that the user

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:48.010
provides. In a different numeric question we might use a different tolerance.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.780
Your task is to implement this new question type. We've give you the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.291
constructor, your job is to provide the set answer method. And the check answer

00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:59.968
method. And the check answer method, you need to take the tolerance into

00:00:59.968 --> 00:01:03.440
account, you need to check whether the given number is not too far away from

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.342
the response. So, technically the response is a a string, you need to convert

00:01:08.342 --> 00:01:12.740
it to a number. And we show you here how to do that. You may need additional

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.051
instance variables. And then you should put them here. Go ahead, give this a

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:16.540
try.
