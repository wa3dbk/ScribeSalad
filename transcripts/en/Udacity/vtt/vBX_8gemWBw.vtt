I wrote a loop with an error. Here it is. Can you fix this code so that it will

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.800
print out the balance every year for ten years? If you want to run this in

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.282
debugging, I highly recommend that you use BlueJ. The Udacity IDE won't be able

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:15.439
to give you all the feedback that you need.
