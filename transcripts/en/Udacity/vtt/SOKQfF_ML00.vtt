Using isinstance we could define the Bear chase like this. We'll first check if

00:00:05.075 --> 00:00:08.832
the victims up a tree if not he is definitely eatable. If he is up a tree well

00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:12.931
it depends whether a Black Bear or a Grizzly Bear. If we're a Black Bear we

00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:16.093
climb the tree, if we're a Grizzly Gear we knock down the tree. Either of those

00:00:16.093 --> 00:00:19.522
makes the victim eatable. If not, the victim is not eatable. We don't have a

00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:23.365
way, to get to the victim if we're some, weak kind of Bear that can't do either

00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:27.164
of those two things. Then, if the victim's eatable, we eat the victim, but

00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:32.342
otherwise there's no dinner for the Bear. Very sad,[SOUND] no dinner, no dinner.

00:00:32.342 --> 00:00:36.230
So think about how you like that code. I'm going to show you another possible

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.243
way to deal with this.
