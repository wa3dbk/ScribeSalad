00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.618
Let's try multiplying this binomial by a monomial. Use what you know about

00:00:03.618 --> 00:00:07.384
multiplication and exponents to figure it out. We haven't done one like this

00:00:07.384 --> 00:00:11.183
before, so don't worry if you don't get it right on your first try. Always try

00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:13.640
to reason through it, and work from what you know.
