00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.460
In this lesson we're going to
cover a lot of ground.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.470
We'll talk about choosing the right
UI patterns, laying out your screens,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.530
working with graphics and
texts, and a whole lot more.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.150
But before we get into all
those really fun things,

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.990
we'll first need to learn about one of
the core aspects of Android design.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.570
That your designs must work on a lot
of often very different devices.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.070
Android runs on all types of things
from tiny watches to phones and tablet's,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.200
even to cars and TV's.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.180
This variety can be daunting.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.120
The good news is that Android has been
designed to handle this variety in

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.410
device types from day one.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.500
The platform gives you a whole
bunch of tools and techniques for

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.920
handling different devices easily and
gracefully.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.230
Your goal should be to create a single
app that runs across a range of devices

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.430
adapting the interface depending on
what device it's currently running on.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.630
As we'll find out throughout the course,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.690
optimizing the user experience across
a variety of device screens and

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.870
form factors isn't that difficult,
and can actually be pretty fun.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.720
Let's start by talking about the screens
on all of these different devices.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.330
At the end of the day, what good is
designing beautiful buttons, text, and

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.010
graphics unless you understand the
screens that it will be shown on, right?

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.130
When thinking about the variety
of screens your Apple run on,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.860
it can be tempting to look
at the screen's resolution

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.340
as the number of pixels on the screen.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.340
Screen resolution is a commonly
used spec when buying a device, but

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.165
it's actually not that useful
when designing for Android.

00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:30.010
because thinking of screens in terms
of pixels ignores the notion of

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.210
physical size, which for
touch device is really really important.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.730
When Android was first released,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.828
there was a single
commercially available device.

00:01:37.828 --> 00:01:40.240
The T-Mobile G1.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.590
As a result, it was easy and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.310
often common practice to design with
the resolution of this device in mind.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.413
Mobile designers accustomed to IOS,
where there was only one form

00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:54.662
factor to design for, would apply
that same practices to Android and

00:01:54.662 --> 00:01:59.000
design assets for one or two flagship
devices with exact pixel sizes.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.072
These designs would look horrible
when viewed in a device with

00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:03.380
different proportions.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.943
Android 1.6, Donut, introduced support
for more varied device types and

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:08.710
densities.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.048
Recognizing that generating
pixel perfect assets for

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:15.748
every existing device doesn't scale and
that one would need

00:02:15.748 --> 00:02:20.190
a systematic way to deal with assets
on different screens to better fit.
