00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.240
There are also vmin and vmax units, which let

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.210
you size things based on the smallest or largest units

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.960
of width and height. This helps make layouts that

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.940
stay consistent across portrait and landscape mode. Using this feature,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.430
it's pretty easy to create a button that takes

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.078
up 1 3rd of the biggest square that will fit

00:00:20.078 --> 00:00:23.730
in the screen. Now using these units, the button

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.990
stays as large as it can be and still fit

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.220
in a third of the space.
