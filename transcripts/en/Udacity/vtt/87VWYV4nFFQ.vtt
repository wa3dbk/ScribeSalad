00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.500
So before I run this program, let me share with

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.950
you my hypothesis of what will happen when I run this

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.510
piece of code. Now one of the first things we are

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.740
doing here in this program, is that we're creating an instance

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.450
of class child we called it miley_cyrus. As soon as that

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.020
line of code runs, the init method inside class child will

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.680
get called. The first line within the init method, is this

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.450
print statement. So my hypothesis is, that this print statement will

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.080
be printed out first in our output. After that

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.590
the constructor for the class parent is going to get

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.370
called. So the control will move from here up to

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.120
here. When the init method for class parent is called,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.580
this statement is going to get executed. So my

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.290
hypothesis is that this print statement parent constructor called will

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.395
be the second thing that gets printed. Then the instance

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:51.760
variable's last name and eye color will be appropriately initialized.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.250
Once the init method for class parent has successfully

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.010
run, the control will come back here. At that

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.280
point, the instance variable number_of_toys will successfully get initialized.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.700
So at that point, the init method for class child

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.480
is done, which means that the instance miley_cyrus has

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.580
been created successfully. Then, the following two print statements which

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.560
are trying to print the last name and number

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.500
of toys for miley_cyrus will get executed in that order.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.160
Alright, this time let me actually run this piece of code. And there's

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.460
my output. And it seems pretty close to what I thought it would

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.900
be. Now, I want you to pause the video here for a second,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.750
and I want you to see if the output here matches your hypothesis.
