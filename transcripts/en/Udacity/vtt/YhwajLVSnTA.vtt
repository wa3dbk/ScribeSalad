00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I hope you've enjoyed our introduction to RSA and asymmetric cryptography.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's really a very powerful idea.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In this unit, we introduced the idea of using asymmetric cryptography

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
both for privacy and for signatures.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There are lots more that we can do with asymmetric cryptography.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We'll talk about some of that in the next unit.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We talked about the RSA cryptosystem,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which is probably still the most widely used public key cryptosystem.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
There are billions of transactions going on every day using RSA.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Nearly every time you use secure website, it's very likely that RSA is being used.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We'll talk about the protocol for that next unit.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We argue that RSA was correct, that it was invertible and had all the properties

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that we needed to be able to encrypt and decrypt messages.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Its correctness depended on theorems that go back thousands of years

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
from Euclid--there are more recent ones, but still many hundreds of years old

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
from Euler and Fermat.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's putting those things together in the right way that lead to this solution

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that enables most of modern ecommerce.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We also argued that RSA is probably secure--at least for the time being.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That depends on the hardness of factoring.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Then we talked about some issues in using RSA in practice,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the dangers of encrypting small messages

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
or messages from a small set of known messages,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and solutions to that based on using random padding.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
There's one issue that we haven't covered yet.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That's how does Bob actually know Alice's public key.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If they can get together in a room, maybe she could give it to him.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
That's not usually possible, so this is a hard problem.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Until we have a solution for that, we're going to have to take away Bob's smiley face.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He's still a little bit frowny.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Until we have a solution to this problem, we don't have a good way

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
to use asymmetric cryptography in practice,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
because it relies on being able to get all these public keys.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That's one of the things we'll talk about next unit--

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
how to build a public key infrastructure so Bob can learn Alice's public key

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
as well as lots more interesting applications of asymmetric cryptography.

00:01:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Hope to see you back for unit 5.
