00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.042
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He's decided that the best way to solve the slingshot sign problem is to use

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:08.095
math. If he can come up with an equation describing the trajectory of a ball

00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:12.190
that makes it through the hoop, he'll be able to find every single point that

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.426
the ball has to pass through to get there. And this will tell him exactly where

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:20.974
not to hang his lovely new sign. If we call the horizontal position of the ball

00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:25.636
at any given time x, and we call its vertical position at the same time y, then

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:30.298
here's a list of the x and y values of the ball at different points throughout

00:00:30.298 --> 00:00:34.871
its trajectory. If we think of the space above the ground at Grant's display

00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:39.351
booth as an x y coordinate plane, where x is horizontal and y is vertical, then

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:43.801
these are just the points that the ball passes through on its way to the hoop.

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:47.711
Looking at the coordinates of these points, do you think that we can find a

00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:51.389
linear equation that goes through all them? Please answer yes or no.
