If you got x squared, 4x, 2x and 8, excellent work. I know I have a square of x

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:10.911
on each side, so the area must be x squared. For this rectangle, one side is x

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:16.248
and the other side is 4. So I get an area of 4 times x. This rectangle has an

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:21.641
area of 2x, since this side is 2 and this side is x. Our last rectangle has an

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:27.633
area of 8. This short side is 2. And this horizontal piece is 4. 2 times 4 makes

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:27.837
8.
