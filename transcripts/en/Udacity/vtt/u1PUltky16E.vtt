what we saw for x janet is traveling at 100 miles per hr.(mph).

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:07.282
and rohan travels at 120 mph.

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:10.276
great work if we found these 2 answers.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:13.050
To start solving these equation we will cross multiply .

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.876
this is really the same as multiplying by the lcd of x(x+20) on both sides.

00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:25.431
if we multiply this side by x(x+20) we will be left with 250(x+20) .

00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:30.655
and if we multiply this side by x(x+20) we will be left with 300x.

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:33.469
since the x+20 reduced to one.

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.554
now I won't show that for the rest of the lesson but whenever we cross multiply we should

00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:39.505
understand thats what we are really doing.

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:45.753
so 250(x+20)=300x we distribute 250 to both of the terms to get 250x+5000=300x

00:00:45.753 --> 00:00:51.122
we subtract 250xfrom both sides to began to isolate x.

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:59.023
so 5000=50x.

00:00:59.023 --> 00:01:03.023
and then finally we divide both sides by 50 to get x is equal to 100(100=x).
