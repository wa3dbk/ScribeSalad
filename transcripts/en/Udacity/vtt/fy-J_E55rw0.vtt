00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.110
The people you see on the screen, are

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.880
students doing the last design project for this course.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.240
That's what you'll be able to do, as

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.210
well. Creating a useful product using the design principles

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.790
of affordances. Conceptual models and signifiers. Plus the

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.450
design skills that you learned in the earlier projects.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.462
Now, here's a brief overview of the course. In

00:00:22.462 --> 00:00:25.440
Lesson 1, we'll ask you to go out and

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.920
take some photographs. But we'll also show you

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.940
how to take photographs that tell a story. Sometimes

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.040
one will be enough, sometimes it might be four

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.480
or five photographs. And then we'll learn how to

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.710
critique them. Decide whether this is effective. Does it

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.970
do a good job? In Lesson 2, time to

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.960
construct something. We're going to have you do a surprising

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.990
construction. One that, well, guess what? It'll really be

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.680
pleasurable and fun. Unexpected. Lesson 3, we're going to put it

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.320
all together. That's the capstone course. So in Lesson 3, you

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.750
have a project that's going to put together all of the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.220
principles you've learned. And the projects that you've done before. Enjoy.
