00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In the lucky search problem, we have 3 inputs.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The index, which is a hash table of all the keywords in the pages in which they appear.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We have the ranks, which rank each page based on the URank algorithm

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that we discussed in lecture.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And then we have the keyword we are searching for.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The output is going to be the highest ranking page with that keyword.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The steps to solve this can briefly be summarized as follows.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We're going to go through every page that contains the keyword,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and we're just going to find the page with the maximum rank.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So we're going to find a maximum.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It sounds pretty simple, but it's actually a few lines of code.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So let's go right to the ID.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So the first thing we're going to do is get the pages from the index with that keyword.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If there aren't any pages, then we're going to return none,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and if there's at least 1 page, we're going to say for now the best_page is the first one.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And we're going to iterate through each page in the pages list,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
updating our best_page accordingly.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So if the rank of the candidate page, the page that we're iterating through,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
is greater than the rank of our best_page, we're going to update our best_page.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Once we're done, we're going to return the best_page.
