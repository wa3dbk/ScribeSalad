00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.810
So let's see how we can do this for a simple image like this one.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.800
What I'm going to do is basically is take this image and go column by column and

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.730
create a difference new image, which basically is

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.710
going to encode nothing else but the difference in the intensity values as we

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.160
go down from one column to the other.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.860
This generates, of course, this new differential image.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.740
Let's look at it again.

00:00:24.478 --> 00:00:27.260
Notice the ridge showing up, a white value here,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.610
because of course we've gone from black to white here.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.250
And of course, a much darker black value here because we've

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.590
gone from white to black.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.960
Nothing of course is visible here even though you can just perceptually see it.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.080
There is nothing there in the in this window here.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.950
Of course, let's look for the same thing in the y direction.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.100
This is my equation for doing differentials in y.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.160
Same process now applied to getting the partials in y.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.060
Again we can see the y changes just like we did here for this image.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.010
Let's look at a much more natural image next.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.140
Here's a zebra image.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.620
Let's do the same exact procedure.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.750
Notice how the stripes have been separated out.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.760
Doing the same in y.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.144
Now, unlike in this case where we just have predominant emotions or

00:01:25.144 --> 00:01:30.150
actually edges or gradient changes just in x and y here, of course, here,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.530
you see a little bit of mixture.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.170
None of the lines are perfectly horizontal or

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.490
vertical, but you can actually extract all of the differential information.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.030
This is quite valuable, and we'll be using this next.
