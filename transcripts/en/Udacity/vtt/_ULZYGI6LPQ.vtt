00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.014
&gt;&gt; This might be a bit surprising but sometimes in math we can just ignore

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:08.357
certain things. If we ignore the negative sign, what we're really doing is

00:00:08.357 --> 00:00:12.651
taking the absolute value of these. So we're just looking at the positive

00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:17.752
distance of each value from the mean. If we multiply each deviation by 2, we'll

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:23.272
still have negative deviations, or negative double deviations now, and positive

00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:28.351
double deviations, and the negatives and positives will still cancel out.

00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:33.138
However, we can square each deviation. A negative times a negative is a

00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:38.994
positive. If we multiply this number by itself, we'll get a positive number. And

00:00:38.994 --> 00:00:43.953
a positive times a positive is also a positive. So we'll end up with some

00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:49.592
positive square deviations. There's always something we can do, never give up.
