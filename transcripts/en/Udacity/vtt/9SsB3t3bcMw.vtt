00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:04.163
So, let's spend a bit of time now looking at this new graph that Athena is using

00:00:04.163 --> 00:00:08.060
for her box-making project. Now, I think that it's pretty incredible if we take

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.470
a second to notice just how different this new purple curve looks from this

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.380
other shape, a parabola, which we're super familiar with by now. Now, if we look

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.070
at their equations, you can notice that the defining difference between the two

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.754
equations is that this one, for the purple curve is of degree 3. And this one

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:31.200
for the parabola is, of course, of degree 2. So, let's explore what makes this

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.960
graph different, just a little bit deeper. So, the first things first, are both

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.635
of these graphs functions? For each equation, pick whether or not it is a

00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:42.343
function.
