00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.468
Well, it turns out there's no solution for this equation, let's see why. We know

00:00:05.468 --> 00:00:11.276
each of these denominators cannot equal zero, so x cannot equal positive 3 and x

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:16.254
cannot equal negative 3. Remember, we don't want these fractions to be

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:20.678
undefined. This number would make this denominator equal to zero. And this

00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:25.128
number would also make this denominator equal zero as well. This last

00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:29.960
denominator as factors of x plus 3 and x minus 3. So really we've already have

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.620
take in account of numbers that x can not be for it since we solved these two

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.856
equations already. If we factor this last denominator we can see that this LCD

00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:43.156
would be x minus 3 times x plus 3. We know this since this is a factor of this

00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:48.762
denominator. And this is also a factor of this denominator. Next, we multiply

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:53.694
each term by the LCD. We cancel the factors that appear in the numerators and in

00:00:53.694 --> 00:00:58.165
the denominators. We're left with 2 times x plus 3 for the first term. And

00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:03.500
negative 3 times x minus 3 for the second term. Our last term is just negative

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.590
12. Since these factors reduce to 1. This is a linear equation that we're

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.340
familiar with. We simply want to distribute this 2 and this negative 3 first and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.008
then combine our like terms and solve for x. Positive 2 x and negative 3 x

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:23.583
equals negative x. And positive 6 and positive 9 equals positive 15. Make sure

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:27.925
you're careful on this distribution. We have negative 3 times negative 3, which

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:32.498
equals positive 9. It's really easy to make that sort of mistake. I'm going to

00:01:32.498 --> 00:01:36.499
rewrite this equation up here. Then we subtract 15 from both sides to get

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:41.449
negative x is equal to negative 3. If we multiply through by a negative 1,

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:46.508
positive x would equal positive 3. But we want to be careful here. We know x

00:01:46.508 --> 00:01:52.026
equals 3 is an excluded value. It makes this denominator and this denominator

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:57.379
equal to 0. So these fractions would be undefined. Since x equals 3 as an

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:02.903
excluded value up here, we know that there's no solution. There's no real number

00:02:02.903 --> 00:02:05.393
that exists that can satisfy this equation.
