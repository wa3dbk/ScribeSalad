00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is the second choice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What we want to know is that we can get the message back,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
so to get the message back.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We started by encrypting the message.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then to decrypt it, now this is what goes in as the cipher text,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so we're going to raise this to the d power mod n.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then if you remember when we looked at Diffie-Hellman,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we have this rule for combining powers of powers,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that this is equivalent to m to the ed mod n,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and we want that to be equivalent to the message.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If we divide both sides by m,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
this becomes 1.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This becomes m to the ed - 1.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We've reduced the power by 1 because dividing by m.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This is the property we want.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If we had this property, all messages would decrypt as one.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That wouldn't be very useful.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This property is always true but not useful,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and this property is unlikely to be true.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That means our goal is to select values for e, d, and n

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that satisfy for all m values, that m to the ed - 1

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is congruent to 1 mod n.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That's our goal.

00:01:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If we have that, we have the correctness property we need for RSA.
