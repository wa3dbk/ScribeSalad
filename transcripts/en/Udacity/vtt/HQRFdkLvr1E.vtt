00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.812
You now know about the fundamentals of interactive rendering. We've covered a

00:00:03.812 --> 00:00:08.116
lot ground. The basics of lighting and cameras, pipelines and bottlenecks,

00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:12.130
pixels and the z-buffer. I'd estimate you now know more that 99.44% of the

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.405
population, about what make interactive rendering tick. In the lessons ahead,

00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:20.092
we'll learn more about these subjects and related fields. You'll also begin to

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:23.676
program and create virtual world to yourself as we delve further into the key

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:25.503
elements of interactive 3D graphics.
