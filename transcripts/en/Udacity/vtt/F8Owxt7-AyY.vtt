00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.080
But if we are ready to go to the market,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.800
if we are ready to deploy our product, then we can

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.160
move to the transition phase, which has mainly to do

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.360
with deployment and maintainence of a system. So what are the

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.950
main activities in the transition phase? As we discussed in

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.280
our initial lessons, in most real world cases, there are issues

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.820
that manifest themselves after deployment, when we release our software and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.870
actual users interact with the

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.230
software. Specifically, users might report failures

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.965
that they experienced while using the system. So, what we call

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:33.120
bug reports. Or they might report improvements they might want to see

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.798
in the software. So typically these will be new feature requests. And

00:00:36.798 --> 00:00:40.270
in addition, there might be issues that don't come necessarily from the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.734
users but that are related to the fact that our system

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:45.920
has to operate, has to work in a new execution environment. For

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.930
example, the new version of an operating system, or the new version

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.474
of a set of libraries. When this happens, we have to address

00:00:51.474 --> 00:00:55.020
these issues by performing maintenance. Specifically, corrective maintenance

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.900
for bug reports, perfective maintenance, for feature requests, and

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.270
adaptive maintenance, for environment changes. And the result of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.319
this is that we will have a new release

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.550
of the software. Other activities that are performed in

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.480
this phase include training, customer service, and providing help-line

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.350
assistance. Finally, if you remember what we saw when

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.810
we were looking at the banking IT system example,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.300
the cycles within a development are not necessarily completely dis-joined, but

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.940
they might overlap a little bit. So something else that might

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.650
happen in the transition phase is that a new cycle may

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.020
start. So there might be some activities that are related to

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.190
the fact that we're starting to think about the new cycle.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.150
So now let's see what kind of outcome these activities will

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.410
produce. The first one is a complete project with all the

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.820
artifacts that we mentioned before. Another outcome is that the product will

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.090
be actually in use. So the product will be in the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.870
hands of the users and the users will start using it, will

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.760
start interacting with it, for real, not just in a beta testing

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.260
setting. Another outcome will be a lesson learnt. What worked. What didn't

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.240
work. What should we do different in the next cycle or in

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.446
the next development? And this is a very important part of the

00:01:59.446 --> 00:02:01.651
whole process, because it;s what provides

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:04.378
feedback between cycles, and between projects.

00:02:04.378 --> 00:02:07.018
And as we said before, in case we have a next released

00:02:07.018 --> 00:02:09.478
planned or a next cycle coming up, we might want to

00:02:09.478 --> 00:02:12.922
start planning for the next release. So another outcome will be

00:02:12.922 --> 00:02:15.783
the plan for the next release. So similar to the other

00:02:15.783 --> 00:02:19.147
phases, also for the transition phase, we have a milestone, which

00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:21.733
is the fourth milestone in this case. And therefore we

00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:25.061
have evaluation criteria for the transition phase that will define whether

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:28.530
we've reached the milestone or not. And in this case, one

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.040
important assessment is whether the user is satisfied. So users are

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.370
actually using our product now, so we can get feedback

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.260
from them, we can see whether the product makes them

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.390
happy or not. And we continue assessing whether our expenditures

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.460
are fine with respect to our estimates. And in this case,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.882
problems with this milestone might lead to further maintenance of

00:02:46.882 --> 00:02:48.840
the system. So for example, we might need to produce

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.460
a new release to address some of the issues that

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.410
the users identified, as we discussed a couple of minutes ago.
