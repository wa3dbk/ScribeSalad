00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.974
So your job was to adjust this program so that

00:00:02.974 --> 00:00:06.214
it works for that building, where both the 13th and

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:09.810
14th floor should be skipped in the elevator. So, that

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.370
means that the numbers from 1 to 12, should stay

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.000
unchanged. There won't ever be an input of 13 or

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.290
14. So that means 15 should get mapped to 13,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.080
16 should become 14, 17, 15 and so on. That

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.600
means if the floor number is 15 or greater, or in

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.520
other words if it's greater than 14, then we want to subtract 2 and not 1.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.680
And those are the two changes that you

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.590
need to make to the program and it'll work.
