00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.390
We had three requirements for
a trusted computing base.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.014
Isolation or tamper-proof was
one of those requirements.

00:00:09.014 --> 00:00:13.440
And we've been talking about
isolation and memory protection.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.330
All that is done to get that
tamper-proof requirement.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.280
Untrusted code cannot be altering
the operating system data and code.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.010
So that was all to do with meeting
one of those requirements,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.390
which is tamper-proof.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.590
The other requirement is complete
mediation, that you should not be able

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.940
to bypass the operating system and
go directly to a protected resource.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.783
So how do we implement
complete mediation?

00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:43.748
Well, the way we do that is we make
sure that no protected resource,

00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:48.339
whether it's a memory page or a file,
could be accessed without going through

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.860
the trusted computing base or
the kernel.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.290
Okay, so the TCB is also the kernel.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.585
The way we do that is by making
the trusted computing base,

00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:02.480
or having it act as a reference monitor.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.210
Any time you have a reference for
a particular resource, the TCB

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.870
has to come into the picture before
you can get to the resource, okay.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.300
The reference has to be monitored
by the trusted computing base.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.070
So there should be no way for
you to bypass,

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.510
where one way you can get around
complete mediation is by that bypassing

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.780
the trusted computing base, there should
be no way for you to bypass this.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.600
So how is that implemented?
