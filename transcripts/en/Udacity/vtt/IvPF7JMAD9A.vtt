Research on attraction shows that people find average and symmetrical faces

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:10.160
more attractive than less average, less symmetrical faces. Now, by average, I

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.020
don't mean common. I mean mathematically average. So, the size, shape, and

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.668
location of facial features have to be the mathematical average of a

00:00:18.668 --> 00:00:23.576
population. So, you can't have a face that's too big or too small, or eyes that

00:00:23.576 --> 00:00:28.594
are too close together or too far apart. Now, why is it that we prefer

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:33.733
symmetry? Well, symmetry can be an indicator of genetic fitness. That is, more

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:37.891
symmetrical faces can be a sign of less genetic mutations, and thus a sign of

00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:40.420
good genetic health.
