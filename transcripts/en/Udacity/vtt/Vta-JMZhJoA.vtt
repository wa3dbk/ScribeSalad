00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
Now, of course, the answers to these are a little bit subjective depending on what you want to model,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.020
but I think that there are three components that are absolutely essential to keep.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.520
The first one is you need a memory for the computer because, otherwise,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.920
it will not really be able to perform any computations.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.840
The second one is you need some sort of input and some sort of output.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.270
It doesn't really have to be a graphical output or be displayed on the monitor,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.650
but you need to be able to tell the computer what the input is that it's suppose to work on

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.570
and you need to have some way of reading the output once the computer is done.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.330
And you'll also need some sort of flexibility in the processing that the computer is doing,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.760
so we expect it to have certain programming capabilities.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.180
All the other components I think are not essential, so you do not necessarily need a graphic's card

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.350
as long as you have a certain type of output.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.740
You certainly don't need a mouse to input anything. You don't need a monitor.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.470
You don't need a file system or operating system because if you really want that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.610
you can emulate that using the programming capabilities and you certainly also

00:01:04.610 --> 99:59:59.000
do not need a CD-ROM as long as you have some way of providing the input.
