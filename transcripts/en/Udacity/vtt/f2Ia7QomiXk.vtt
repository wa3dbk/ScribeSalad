00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.077
This looks better, but it won't work yet. First, you'll need to implement

00:00:04.077 --> 00:00:09.030
getLowScorePosition. Implement it so that it only looks through the data once.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.596
And remembers the position of the low score, as well as the score itself. To

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:16.620
implement getLowScoreIndex, we'll follow the algorithim we talked about

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.730
earlier, for finding the first portrait in the picture gallery. But this time,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.214
we're using it on a partially filled array, instead of an ArrayList. So we have

00:00:25.214 --> 00:00:29.085
to be more careful. We'll start by assuming that the lowest score, is the first

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:32.979
one. Then we'll look at all of the items, starting at one, because we already

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:37.754
looked at zero. Now for each of those elemlents, we'll compare it to the lowest

00:00:37.754 --> 00:00:44.432
score, and if it's smaller, we changed what we think the lowest score is. Now,

00:00:44.432 --> 00:00:49.390
while we're looking for the lowest score, we also need to look for its index.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.640
So, initially we assumed that the lowest score index was zero, and when we find

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.640
a lower score, we'll update the lowest score index to be the index of that

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.751
score. Now, when we finish looking at everything, the lowest score index that

00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:05.500
we found so far will be the overall lowest score index. Now that I have this

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.596
method, the simpler version of removing the minimum score will work. I'll test

00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:13.590
it so I can be sure. And it looks like it correctly dropped one of the fives.
