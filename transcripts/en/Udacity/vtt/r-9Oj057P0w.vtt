00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
Vertex cover is so much easier to solve for this graph over here.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.560
It would actually be solved by pre-processing alone, although both graphs

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.770
have the same number of vertices.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:16.490
It seems like the size of the input is actually not the best way to measure

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.440
how hard it is to solve an NP complete problem for that input.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.690
It seems kind of unfair to just say to this graph here--well, you're just as large

00:00:23.690 --> 99:59:59.000
as this one over here, so we're going to assume that you're just as hard to solve.
