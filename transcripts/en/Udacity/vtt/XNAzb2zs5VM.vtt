00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.170
Three of the most common data formats are CSV,

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.930
XML, and JSON. I want to quickly discuss what one

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.380
record in the Lahman Baseball Database would look like in

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.860
each of these different formats. It just so happens that

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.130
the first row in this data set corresponds to a

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.260
pretty famous baseball player. Hank Aaron. Let's first discuss what

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.950
this data looks like in the format we originally downloaded

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.720
it in, CSV. In the CSV format we usually have

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.870
a series of rows. With each row corresponding to an

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.880
entry. There is a header row at the top of

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.210
our file. Where our comma separated values do not correspond

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.400
to an entry but instead tell us what each entry means

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.790
for the rest of the document. In the case of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.700
this baseball document, our first row tells us that every

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.040
row will have some identifiers, the Lahman ID. The player

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.830
ID, the manager ID, et cetera. Then we'll see birth year,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.920
birth month, birth day and then a bunch of other

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.630
statistics. If we go and look at the entry for

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.010
Hank Aaron. We see all of these values, 1 for

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.990
Lahman ID, aaronha01 for player ID, et cetera, separated by

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.347
commas. Note that if a particular player doesn't have a

00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:10.140
value for one field, for example Hank Aaron does not

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.000
have a manager ID, we simply see two commas in

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.950
a row. In the case of an XML document, we end

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.190
up with something that pretty closely resembles HTML. We

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.150
can have a document element, which is opened. It can

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.255
then have a series of tables, which are also

00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:27.970
opened, as we see here. The table has a number

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.490
of children, which correspond to the values that we

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.250
just discussed in the CSV 1 for Lahman ID, aaronha01

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.640
for player Id, etc. Note that when we're missing

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.600
a value in XML, things are treated a bit differently.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.510
For example, since Hank Aaron was not a manager, we

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.860
just open the manager ID field and then put a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.880
slash at the end. Finally, for a JSON document, we

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.980
have a number of JSON objects indicated by these curly

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.070
braces. A JSON object looks a lot like a Python

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.148
dictionary. We have keys. Which correspond to what we would

00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:03.458
see in the header row in a CSV file followed

00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:07.030
by values. Note that in the case of a missing value,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.930
we simply open and close the quotation marks. Oftentimes,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.730
the benefit of XML or JSON is that they support

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.530
nested structures in a way that CSV documents cannot.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.560
I don't want to go into this in great detail,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.630
but you can imagine that the value corresponding to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.000
a particular JSON key, say braves, could itself be another

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.840
JSON object. Here's what that might look like. One final

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.347
note, is to remember that when we talk about different

00:02:32.347 --> 00:02:34.730
formats that data can come in, it's not a

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.036
matter of the file extension being .CSV or being

00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:40.747
.JSON. A file format really has to do with

00:02:40.747 --> 00:02:44.010
how the data is organized inside of a file.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.350
So we could easily have data that is formatted

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.470
in JSON or CSV, but that comes in a

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.880
file whose extension is .txt. Since the online MTA

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.510
subway data comes in CSV format, in the weather underground

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.019
API responds to requests with a JSON object. We'll discuss

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.300
how to load and process files in these two formats.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.290
While we won't explicitly discuss loading and processing XML files,

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.300
it isn't that different than the material will cover with regards

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.080
to JSON and CSV. If you'd like to learn more

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.350
about dealing with XML data in particular. I recommend you take

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.730
the data wrangling class with Mongo DB taught here at

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.470
Udacity. For now, let's discuss how to work with CSV files.
