00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.610
Our horizontal asymptote is y equals 2. We can see, from the other way to write

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.425
this rational function, 2 plus 17 over 4x squared minus 9. As x gets really

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:14.390
big, the denominator, here, will get very, very large. Which means, this

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.290
fraction as a whole, will get to be very tiny. That means, that the value of

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.220
the function, is going to approach 2, as x gets really big.
