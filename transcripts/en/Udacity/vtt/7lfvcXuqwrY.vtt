00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.250
I look for a developer that has
a strong basis in Java, but

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.590
also has a very wide knowledge
of Android in general.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.720
You find a lot of developers
that have very specific roles

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.580
the where they only know a very
narrow system of Android.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.510
I think just having a good grasp on
every fundamentals is very important.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.810
When I interview candidates I'm
looking for candidates that,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.890
I intentionally give them a very broad
question, and I want them to clarify.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.150
I want them to be able to ask
me more questions about it.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.870
Follow up with kind
of other solutions or

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.850
just be very creative
on possible answers.
