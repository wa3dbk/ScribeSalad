00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.175
A smaller bin size will allow us more detail. For example let's cut the bin size

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:10.271
in half. The bin size is now 10 instead of 20 resulting in twice as many columns

00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:15.311
or intervals. So there are now twice as many numbers for which we know exactly

00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:18.972
the proportion less than or greater than those values.
