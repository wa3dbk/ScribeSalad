00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For your homework, I want these ranges of variables, as seen.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
But if you want true challenges, here are some more.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
For instance, you can go and also record the types of variables,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
say, the type of x is the same as the type of 2.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Or you could go and check for set patterns.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
For instance, you could report that the variable x

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is in the list of values 2, 4, and 16.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The relationships between variables--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In the square root function, the y variable always has the same value as the return value.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That's not very surprising, because we actually return y, but that's an interesting property.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Likewise, the return value of a square root function

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is always less or equal to the value that we want to compute the square root for.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You can obtain such relationships between variables

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
by coming up with a pattern, say like equal or less than,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and instantiating that pattern with all variables,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and then seeing which patterns actually hold over multiple runs.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
With that, enjoy building your own dynamic invariant checker,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and make it easier for future generations to write assertions. Thank you.
