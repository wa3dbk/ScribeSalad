00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.400
To get started, we want to give you
a big picture view of machine learning.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:03.950
What it is?

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:04.710
Where it came from?

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.530
And what you'll learn in
this nano degree program?

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.490
Machine learning borrows
heavily from two fields,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.820
artificial intelligence and
data science.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.630
So, we'll start by talking
a bit about those areas and

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.170
how machine learning fits in.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.350
Using some material from one of Georgia
Tech's artificial intelligence classes

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.880
and one of you to ask these
data science classes.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.660
Then we'll move on to machine
learning more closely and

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.820
start looking at Georgia Tech's
machine learning class and

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.840
ask these machine learning class.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.440
Finally, we'll conclude by looking at
some of the basics of machine learning,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.369
like classification and regression,
in order to get a feel for

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.770
how machine learning is really
about building models of data.
