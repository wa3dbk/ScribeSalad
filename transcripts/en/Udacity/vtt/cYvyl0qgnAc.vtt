Great. Now that we've got our data loaded, we're at the point where we can

00:00:03.244 --> 00:00:08.321
start playing some sounds. [SOUND]. Let's take a look at our skeleton code for

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:12.845
this. We have a play sound method, that takes a path to the sound effect that

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:23.038
you want to play. As well as an object containing all the settings. For our

00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:27.322
purposes, let's say that the setting's dictionary contains a bullion looping for

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:31.354
checking whether we want to loop an effect, and volume to set our initial gain

00:00:31.354 --> 00:00:38.016
at. What we want you to do, is to create a source to play this sound. Connect

00:00:38.016 --> 00:00:42.830
it to our main node, and then start playing it. Now there will be a bunch of

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.240
little things that you're going to have to keep track of here. Is the sound

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.920
manager enabled? Is the sound loaded? Or are we trying to play a null sound?

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.235
Don't worry, we're going to be giving you feedback as you submit your code, and

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:58.920
which possibilities you haven't taken into account yet.
