You've written a lot of interesting programs already and that's great. But one

00:00:03.272 --> 00:00:06.992
capability that was lacking so far was to be able to ask the user to supply

00:00:06.992 --> 00:00:12.203
input. Here's how you do it in Java. Just like you use System.out for output.

00:00:12.203 --> 00:00:17.752
You use System.in to get input from the user. But as it turns out System.in is

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:23.407
not very smart and to really read numbers and strings from the keyboard you use

00:00:23.407 --> 00:00:31.135
an object of the scanner class. You construct a scanner with a new operator,

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:37.318
new scanner and this is the scanner that can read from System.in. Usually, you

00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:40.798
want to read more than one input, so it makes sense to save the scanner in a

00:00:40.798 --> 00:00:46.965
variable. Here it is. It's called in and of course it's of type scanner. Then,

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:50.385
when the time has come to read something you call one of the methods of the

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:55.798
scanner class. Here, I called the nextInt method. It reads an integer that the

00:00:55.798 --> 00:01:00.994
user types in. And returns it, and here I'm saving that integer in the age

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:05.040
variable. So, you should think of a scanner, kind of like a supermarket

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.784
scanner, except a supermarket scanner of course reads a bar code. And our

00:01:09.784 --> 00:01:14.093
scanner here reads something from the user, and also produces some number. The

00:01:14.093 --> 00:01:18.016
program snippet that I've written here is not quite complete. After all, how is

00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:22.544
the user supposed to know that then I'll ask for their age. So, before calling

00:01:22.544 --> 00:01:27.029
a scanner method that reads user input, you always want to alert the user first

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:32.659
with the statement such as this one. The string here, how old are you, is

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.170
called a prompt string. It prompts the user to then take the next step and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.926
provide an input. Note that with the prompt string, we put a blank space here,

00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:46.720
that just looks prettier, so that the users input is a little bit separated.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.933
When you print the prompt it looks prettier when both the prompt and the user

00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:54.960
input are on the same line. That's why we're using print and not println here.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.023
And then, you want to have a blank space to separate the prompt from the user

00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:06.490
input. Here, we write an integer, you can also read a decimal number by calling

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.032
nextDouble that returns a double. And again, you would then want to capture it

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:15.470
in a variable. Let me demo this in BlueJ, so you can see what it looks like

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.890
before you get to try it yourself.
