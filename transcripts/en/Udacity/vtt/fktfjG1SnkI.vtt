00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.147
Well this one means that you're squaring each of these values, and then adding

00:00:05.147 --> 00:00:10.089
them up. Which isn't what we're doing here. Here we're adding up the squared

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:15.352
deviations. For this one you really have to be careful about having parentheses

00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:21.286
or no parentheses. Because this means that we only sum up the values, all of

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:27.840
these, and then we subtract the squared mean, which isn't what we did. Again,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.825
here parenthesis are important. This means that we sum up all the values, then

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:42.136
we subtract the mean, and then we square the result. That's not what we did.

00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:47.686
This one doesn't have a summation sign, which means that we take some arbitrary

00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:53.547
value, unspecified. So like $38,801, for example. And then we subtract the mean.

00:00:53.547 --> 00:00:59.089
And then we square the results. And that's again, not what we did. But this one

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.135
says that you take this, which is each value, minus the mean, to get the

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:09.905
deviation. You square each deviation, and then you add them all up. So this is

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:15.895
the correct formula for adding these up. This is called SS, for sum of squares.
