00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.240
There is a little bit of different solution this inequality. We could add 2 in

00:00:04.252 --> 00:00:08.290
our answer now, so we need a different way of writing the answer in a set of

00:00:08.302 --> 00:00:12.505
parenthesis. We're going to use brackets. We use a bracket to indicate that the

00:00:12.517 --> 00:00:16.580
variable x could take on that value. The same is true on the number line. x can

00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:20.915
now equal to, so we put a bracket in set of a parenthesis. And again, notice I

00:00:20.927 --> 00:00:24.920
have an open parenthesis for infinity. The interval is considered to be open on

00:00:24.932 --> 00:00:28.840
this end, because we can always count higher to a number. We can't really reach

00:00:28.852 --> 00:00:32.840
positive infinity, so we use a parenthesis. In general, for less than or equal

00:00:32.852 --> 00:00:36.810
to signs and greater than or equal to signs, you will always use a bracket. For

00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:41.475
less than and greater than, you'll use parentheses. And of course, parentheses

00:00:41.487 --> 00:00:46.630
always go around positive infinity or negative infinity. Let's put these symbols

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:47.030
to use.
