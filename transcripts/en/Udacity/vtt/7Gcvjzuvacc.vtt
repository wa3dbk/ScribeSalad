00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.030
Okay, the next thing we're going to do, is add

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.109
let's replace our dictionary cache in ASCII Chan with

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.750
memcached. Okay, here we are in ASCII Chan. fortunately,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.630
memcached is, there's a, there's a version built into the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.150
App Engine that you run on your local machine,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.860
so you can develop against it. And then when

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.330
you deploy your machine on App Engine, Google has

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.460
memcache already spread out for you across many machines and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.320
you don't have to deal with it. So, that's a very

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.900
nice convenience. First what we do, is we import it which is

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.440
just, it's in the Google App Engine API memcache. So we

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.160
do that. And now let's replace our dictionary cache with memcache. Which

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.390
should be pretty straightforward, since the two behave very similarly. Okay,

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.220
the first thing we could get rid of is this cache line,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.190
we don't need that any more. So, we got rid of

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.620
our cache dictionary, let's use the memcache library now. Now, this syntax

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.320
here, key in CACHE, and all that stuff, is specific

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.770
to Python dictionaries, so we need to get rid of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.110
that. Instead let's try to look up arts up out

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.802
of memcache. So it is going to be arts equals

00:00:58.802 --> 00:01:04.709
memcache.get key. In memchache in the official protocol, both keys

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.480
and values need to be strings. In this library values

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.440
can be Python DataTypes in the Memcache library. That Google

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.870
provides, we'll convert your Python Data Type into a string.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.160
And then when you fetch the data out of the cache, it

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.860
will convert it back into your Python Data Type. So we can

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.640
still store our our objects directly in the CACHE but the keys

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.070
need to be strings and so we're going to use top as our

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.660
key. Now, we're going to change this if statement a little bit because

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.050
now, we just looked up arts out of memCache. And if it's

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.360
not in the cache Arts will be none. So let's structure this

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.120
like so; If Arts is none or update, round the query and

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.790
we don't need that other line. Now, so the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.630
query doesn't change, we need to change this line to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.700
set the key in the Cache. Which is memCache.set key,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.380
arts and that should do it. Okay, so let's go

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.770
ahead and try this out on our browser we,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.120
we're in our page now. If I reload this page,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.750
we can go to our terminal and we can see

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.450
that we ran a DB query on our GET request,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.288
and if we were to run another, if we were

00:02:09.288 --> 00:02:12.520
to reload that page again, I reloaded it. You would

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.670
see that moved onto a DB Query, pretty cool huh.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.220
I want to show you something built in the App Engine

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.190
is an Admin tool. If you are running App Engine

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.100
you can go _aah/admin/memcache. You can actually view the memcache thing,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.640
if I reload this page, it says we have one

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.430
item in our Cache. If I were to click Flush Cache,

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.370
we can actually clear the Cache and if I were to

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.280
reload this page and then check out our console. You can see

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.610
that we ran a database query again, and if I go back

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.550
to our page here and reload it, we can see that we

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.010
have one item in our Cache, cause we just loaded it. This

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.620
is kind of neat you can type in a, a k, key here

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.990
and click Display and it'll show you the value, in that Cache.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.260
And in this case it as top is pickled. Pickled is the,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.210
Python library for converting a Python Object in to a string. And

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.380
then the Google memcache library is automatically doing that for us. So,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.970
yeah pretty neat handy tool here. If you want to test your

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.830
caching you can sit here and flush it and you can see how

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.660
many items are in the Cache and manipulate it that way. Anyway

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.810
that's how you implement ad memcache to your App. Once you understand the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.020
algorithm for caching, you know check the Cache, return the value, hit

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.220
the deviant. You know that sort of thing, using memcache is a sinch.
