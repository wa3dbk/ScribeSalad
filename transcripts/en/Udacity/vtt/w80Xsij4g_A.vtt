00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.120
All right.
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.975
Today, we're going to start heading
up the Computer Vision food chain.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:09.833
We started with basic
images as functions.

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:12.960
We did some image processing,
edge detection, manipulation.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.556
Then we did some low-level computation
of vision and things like motion,

00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:18.083
stereo.

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:21.090
We considered some geometry,
such as things like essential and

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.210
fundamental matrices that related how
cameras were viewing a scene, panoramas,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.150
sift features, et cetera.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.917
Even the tracking of objects.

00:00:28.917 --> 00:00:32.000
But all of that stuff is
really semantic-free.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.227
And what I mean by semantic-free is
there was no notion of what the object

00:00:36.227 --> 00:00:38.460
was, what you and I would refer to it.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.571
So when I look at the table, I see a,
a cup of coffee that I paid way too much

00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:43.662
money for
at some really expensive coffee shop,

00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:46.125
because that's what we all do
in academia in these days.

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:49.833
But the idea is that I know that,
that thing is a cup of coffee.

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:53.477
So for this section and a little bit
of the discussions going forward,

00:00:53.477 --> 00:00:56.030
we're going to be talking
about recognition.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.167
Recognition being
the labeling of the object.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:01.057
In particular,
we typically think of it as

00:01:01.057 --> 00:01:04.833
labeling objects with labels
that humans would understand.

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:07.225
The other thing I want to say before
we get in is we're only going to do

00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:08.390
a little bit of this.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.941
And that's because object re,

00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:12.875
recognition has become hugely
driven by machine learning.

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:16.715
Machine learning is a general field
where you have lots of data that

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:21.265
some of which is, is often labeled or
supervised, described what's there.

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:25.184
And you have training data and
you use that to be able to do label or

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:27.833
categorize or
describe some new novel input.

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:31.148
We're going to talk a little bit about
that, but only a little little, because

00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:34.208
machine learning is such a big field
that if you want to understand more of

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:37.625
the details, you, you almost have to
take an entire machine learning course.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:40.863
So we'll be touching on the underlying
machine learning methods,

00:01:40.863 --> 00:01:42.996
especially a couple lessons from now.

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:46.322
But mostly, we'll try to talk a bit
about how its been applied to

00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:47.872
a Computer Vision scenario.
