00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.750
Now we can continue to apply this method of generate and test iteratively. So we

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.810
can apply it on this state and that state and see what successor states we get.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.580
If we do so, then we get a very large number of successor states. This is

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.480
a problem of call many total explosion. While one was tasked with a small number

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.219
of states, but the number of successor states keeps on increasing very rapidly.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.419
Now, the reason it is occurring here and it did not occur when we are talk,

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.496
dealing with semantic networks is because here we have states like this one

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:37.441
which have three guards and three prisoners on the same side of the bank,

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:42.450
exactly the same state that was the initial state to begin with. This is because

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.100
we have a dumb generator and a dumb tester. So this state never got pruned away,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.390
although this particular state is identical to the initial state that we

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.880
started from. This method of generating test, even with a dumb generator and

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.560
a dumb tester, if applied iteratively could finally lead to the goal state.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.920
In which case, we will have a path from the initial state all the way to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.560
the goal state, but this will be computationally very inefficient.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.700
This is because we have a dumb generator and a dumb tester. So

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.300
the question now becomes, can we make a smarter generator and

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.430
a smarter tester? Before we make a smarter generator and a smarter tester,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.700
we should note that generate and test is a very powerful problem solving method.
