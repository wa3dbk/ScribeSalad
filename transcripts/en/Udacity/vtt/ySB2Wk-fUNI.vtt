00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.325
This is a conditional equation. If we were to replace c with 1 for example, then

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:10.625
our equation would say 598 equals 92 times 1. We could simplify that to say that

00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:15.700
598 equals 92, but we know that that's not true, 598 is not equal to 92. That

00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:20.950
means that there are some values of c for which this equation is not true, so we

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.968
know already that this is not an identity.

00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:27.685
I'll tell you right now, though, that this last choice, that this is not an

00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:31.655
equation, is incorrect. There is, in fact, one value for which this equation is

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:34.290
true. Our next step is going to be to find that value.
