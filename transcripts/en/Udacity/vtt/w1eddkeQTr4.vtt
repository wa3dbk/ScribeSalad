00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.882
All right, let's recap what we've
learned so far about strings.

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:07.591
We started out by talking about
what a string is composed of,

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:11.023
and we saw how to define
a string using a string literal.

00:00:11.023 --> 00:00:15.029
Use letter var the way you would with
any other constant or variable, and

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.194
then type your string,
literal in between quotations.

00:00:18.194 --> 00:00:22.292
We also learned that Swift strings
are coded with uni code scalers.

00:00:22.292 --> 00:00:26.657
For this reason, we're able to
incorporate an uni code character in to

00:00:26.657 --> 00:00:28.780
a Swift string including emojis.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.368
Let’s make two strings similar
to those above, but this time,

00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:35.102
use the monkey emoji and
the mobile phone emoji.

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:38.865
Remember, to access the emoji
keyboard in playgrounds,

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:41.333
you can press Ctrl+Cmd+spacebar.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.132
We also learned that the strings
in Swift are encoded in a struct.

00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:48.762
And the characters of a string can be
accessed through the characters property

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:50.302
belonging to the string struct.

00:00:50.302 --> 00:00:54.773
For example, let's say we wanted to
count how many g's are in this string.

00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:59.245
We could loop though all the characters
in this string using the character's

00:00:59.245 --> 00:01:03.043
property like so and increment
a count each time we encounter a g.

00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:06.025
And then if we type count
into playground, and

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:09.860
look over in the sidebar,
we can see that our count is five.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.043
String interpolation is another
incredibly convenient feature of Swift

00:01:14.043 --> 00:01:14.653
strings.

00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:15.891
Here's an example.

00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:20.189
Let's say we have to convert from an
integer representing number of pennies

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.751
to a string representing dollars and
cents.

00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:31.013
We can use string interpolation along
with operators to get our solution.

00:01:31.013 --> 00:01:32.808
We can calculate the number of
dollars by dividing by 100, and

00:01:32.808 --> 00:01:34.711
we can calculate the number of
cents by taking the modular of 100.

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:38.947
Then, through string interpolation,
we can take this variable,

00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:43.572
dollarInt, along with this expression,
and insert them into a string.

00:01:43.572 --> 00:01:47.563
And you can see that string
here in the sidebar.

00:01:47.563 --> 00:01:50.881
We looked at some common string
manipulations starting with string

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:51.762
concatenation.

00:01:51.762 --> 00:01:56.429
For example, we can combine our monkey
string and our thief string to make

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.903
a very short story about
a monkey with sticky fingers.

00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:03.045
We also learned that the swift
string struct is also

00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:05.903
bridged to the NS string
class in objective C.

00:02:05.903 --> 00:02:10.264
This opens a host of useful methods
including contained string,

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:14.083
string by replacing the current string,
and lots more.

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:16.693
Let's look at those
methods one more time.

00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:20.917
Here, we're calling the method
containsString on the variable

00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:24.692
monkeyString, and
we're passing in key as a parameter.

00:02:24.692 --> 00:02:28.861
By doing this, we're asking if the
monkeyString contains the string key.

00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:33.132
And over here on the sidebar,
we can see that the method returns true.

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:34.572
Here's another one.

00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:37.254
Let's say our WiFi
password is meet me in St.

00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:39.522
Louis but we need to switch it up a bit.

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:43.558
Let's replace all the e's with
3's using the NSString method,

00:02:43.558 --> 00:02:46.306
stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString.

00:02:46.306 --> 00:02:50.465
And what you're looking at here is
the variable name followed by the dot

00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:53.667
operator
stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString.

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:57.739
And then the parameters we're passing in
are the string we want to replace and

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.126
the replacement string.

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:01.520
And over here in the sidebar,
we can see the result.
