00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.209
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Our second option, however, is to solve this just algebraically. We've solved

00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:08.327
quadratic equations before, when we're trying to find x intercepts. The only

00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:12.295
difference between those situations, and this one, is that we have a 3 over

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:16.639
here. Remember that a quadratic equation, is anything that can be written in the

00:00:16.639 --> 00:00:20.793
form Ax squared plus Bx plus C equals 0. The issue here, is that we don't have

00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:25.250
0, on this side of the equation, so let's make it happen. How do we do that? You

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.597
know you just subtract 3 from both sides, that gives us X squared plus 8x plus

00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:34.101
twelve equals 0. Since you know how to solve this using factoring, I'd like you

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:38.359
to tell me the possible solutions for X. In the event that you find X can take

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.575
on multiple values to make this equation true, please just write all those

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.428
values in this box but separate them with commas.
