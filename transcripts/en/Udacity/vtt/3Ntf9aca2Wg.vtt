00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.710
The third case is where the faulting page is

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.220
not available in the cluster memories at all. In

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.500
other words, the only copy exists on the disk.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.180
So in this case, what has to happen is, when

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.260
we have the page fault on node P for this x, we have to go to the disk to

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.760
fetch it. And we're going to fetch it, which

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.592
means that the working set on node P is growing,

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:28.680
similar to the first case. And so the local part is

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.120
going to go up by one. In order to make room for

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.670
that, I have to necessarily shrink the global part as in

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.710
the first case. So, I am going to shrink that global part by

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.538
1. By the way, I can pick any page from the

00:00:40.538 --> 00:00:43.868
global part, and both in the first case, as well as in

00:00:43.868 --> 00:00:47.272
this case, we can pick any page from the global part and

00:00:47.272 --> 00:00:50.826
send it out to a peer memory. And that's what we're doing

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:55.340
here, so we are saying, here is a page that I have to get rid of. Who do I send

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.663
it to? Well, I am going to send it to the

00:00:57.663 --> 00:01:01.343
guy that happens to have the globally oldest page in the

00:01:01.343 --> 00:01:05.140
entire cluster. So let's say there is some host R

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.830
that has the globally oldest page in the entire cluster, and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.050
that globally oldest page in the host R could be

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.200
on the local part or the global part of this host.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.210
So what we're going to do is, we're going to tell that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.740
guy, hey, I'm going to give you a page to hold,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.200
because this used to be in my global part, I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.770
don't have room anymore, because my local is increasing by one

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.040
because of this page fault, and adding x to my

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.170
working set now. So please hold on to this page that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.290
I'm going to give you, in your global cache. Now

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.260
this guy has a split like this. So if it has

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.010
to make room for this new page that is

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.690
coming in from its peer, clearly it has to get

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.520
rid of something. Where it will get rid of? Well,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.190
it has to throw it on the disk. Now, the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.590
interesting part is, if the oldest page on host R happens

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.340
to be in the global cache of R, what can we say about that page z?

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.360
Well, it has to be cleaned, because global part is nothing but a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.050
paging device. And therefore if it is here, it must

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.020
be cleaned, and therefore, I can discard it without worrying

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.690
about it. Just simply dump it. Drop it on the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.060
floor [LAUGH]. That's what I'm going to do. On the other

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.100
hand, if it is on the local part, it could

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.960
be dirty. That is, if the oldest page happens to

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.800
be on host R, and it also happens to be

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.090
in the local part of host R, it is conceivable

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.440
that this page has been modified, in which case,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.960
that modified copy has to be written out to

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.310
the disk. So in other words, when we pick

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.870
host R to send this replacement page from my host,

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.755
this guy, what he's going to do is, he's going to say, I have to get rid of

00:02:50.755 --> 00:02:53.000
a page in order to make room for this

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.750
incoming global page, because i have the globally oldest page.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.480
And if I have the globally oldest page, then let

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.035
me get rid of it by throwing it out onto the

00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:05.460
disk if it happens to be dirty. If it happens to

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.130
be clean, simply drop it on the floor, because I know

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.720
that all the pages are contained on the disk. That's the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.450
fundamental assumption we started with, that all the pages of the

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.460
currently active processes are on the disk. It is just that

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.220
the global cache of every node is acting as a surrogate

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.790
for the disk, because it can be faster to

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.860
access from the peer memory than from the disk. So

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.690
similar to the first case, in this case also,

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.430
the local portion of the physical memory allocation on host

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.540
P is going to go up by one, and the

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.350
global portion is going to go down by one. What

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.010
about host R, well it really depends. If the oldest

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.420
page on host R happens to be in the global

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.730
cache, then there is no change, because I am

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.550
reading the old page z for another page that is

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.400
coming in from host P, that is y that

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.130
is coming in. In that case there is no change

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.920
in the allocation between local and global on host

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.516
R. But on the other hand, if the globally oldest

00:04:07.516 --> 00:04:10.222
page happens to be from the local part of

00:04:10.222 --> 00:04:13.994
host R, what that means is that even though originally

00:04:13.994 --> 00:04:19.160
we thought z to be part of the working set of host R, clearly, the processes

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.784
that were using it are either no longer

00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:26.294
active, or they're completed, or whatever, and therefore,

00:04:26.294 --> 00:04:30.420
we're throwing out this page. The local part

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.230
is shrinking. If the local part on host

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.800
R is shrinking, what that means is, I

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.130
can use more of the memory that's available

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.960
in host R for community service. That's the

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.500
important message I should get out. That's the

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.230
important message I want you to get out

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.060
of looking at this particular page fault scenario.
