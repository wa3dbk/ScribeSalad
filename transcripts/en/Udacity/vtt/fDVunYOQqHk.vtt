Diagnosis is a very common cognitive task. It occurs whenever our expectations

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.880
are violated. We start diagnosing. Why were our expectations violated?

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.910
Within a system, we expect some behavior out of it. We get a different behavior.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.000
Why did the system not give the behavior we expected from it? Notice that

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.500
diagnosis is a task. We can use several methods to address it, like case-based

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.730
reasoning. We have discussed diagnosis on several contexts like medicine,

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.715
program debugging, car repair, but it's also very common in other aspects of

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:36.910
our life. For example, you get unexpected traffic. Why did it occur? We review

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.560
interaction with a co-worker or the economy. All are examples of diagnosis
