To plot 5,115, we start with the horizontal coordinate. Beginning at 0, we count

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:09.835
to the right 5. And then, we deal with the vertical coordinate. From there, we

00:00:09.847 --> 00:00:14.460
count up 115. And that brings us to this point. But from bringing back our

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:19.596
graph, we can see another way that we could have figured this out. By looking at

00:00:19.608 --> 00:00:23.778
the line that we drew for the entire equation. Remember that on our table, we

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.060
saw 5 and 115 as a pair of values for d and n that belong together. Since it was

00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:32.339
from that table that we developed our equation, and from our equation that we

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:36.734
got to this graph, it makes sense the graph would fit the table. What's really

00:00:36.746 --> 00:00:40.885
cool about our line, though, is that our table only had the points that are

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:45.228
highlighted here in orange. Those are all the data we were given. But now, with

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.546
this whole line, we can start to make some extrapolation about data later on.
