Here's the answer--what we need to do additionally in checkRep is we need to check

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
whether every single element of the zip code is between 0 and 9,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so we set up loop that iterates over the elements and check this for every single element of the string.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We could also come up with a regular expression that ensures

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that we have a sequence of five digits between 0 and 9.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I will leave that for the more advanced among you.
