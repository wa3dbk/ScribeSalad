00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.850
ARIA allows us to add extra semantics
into our HTML via attributes.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.990
Essentially, it allows us to
modify the accessibility tree

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.990
without changing anything else about
the page presentation or behavior.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.520
By default, it won't affect styling nor
will it affect interactive behavior.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.260
The only thing it changes is how
the page appears to assistive

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.020
technology users.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.850
We've already taken a look at how we can
use ARIA to change an element's role,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.580
state and properties.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.710
And how we can use ARIA to fine tune
the accessible name for an element.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.190
Next stop, we're going to learn a little
more about how ARIA's semantics

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.288
interact with native HTML semantics.

00:00:36.288 --> 00:00:40.520
We're also going to look at some special
ARIA attributes which allow us to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.480
define some more nuanced
relationships between elements

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.730
than what we can express in the DOM.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.840
And we're going to lie about how and
why we can choose to hide or

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.310
show information exclusively for
assistive technology users.
