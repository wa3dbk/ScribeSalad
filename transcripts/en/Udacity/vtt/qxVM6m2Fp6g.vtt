00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.461
In addition, Hart and Risley found that the children from the high income

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:06.878
families heard more praise words or encouragement words than did those from the

00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:12.931
welfare families. Specifically, those from professional families heard a ratio

00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:19.107
of six positive words to every one negative word. And those in the middle class

00:00:19.107 --> 00:00:26.076
families, heard two positive words for every one negative word. For those from

00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:33.400
welfare families, they heard one positive word for every two negative words. So

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.960
not only did type of family status play a role in the number of words on

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.430
average children heard per hour and the number of words they heard per year.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.883
They also found that the type of words, positive and encouraging, versus

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:55.980
negative and discouraging, different among family type. This is an excellent

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.530
demonstration of how the environment or nurture can have a great impact on our

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.811
vocabulary. So, why is vocabulary size important. Well, Hart &amp; Risley found in

00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:12.355
their longitudinal research that the vocabulary size of the children at age

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:16.970
three demonstrated a strong positive correlation to language test scores at

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:25.570
ages nine and ten. In vocabulary, listening, syntax, and reading comprehension.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.796
This study nicely demonstrates the importance of nurture or the environment on

00:01:30.796 --> 00:01:32.492
language.
