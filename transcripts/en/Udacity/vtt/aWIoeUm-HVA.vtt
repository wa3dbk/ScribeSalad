We just use some basic SQL to pull out one link.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It had a where clause that looked something like this.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's talk about how we can make this a little bit fancier.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Instead of just saying ID = 2, let's change this constraint a little bit.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I've changed the clause to be instead of ID = something

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to submitter ID = 5.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Okay, so I've added an and clause.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Select * from links where submitter ID = 5 and votes &gt; 23.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And this is a perfectly legit SQL query, and it will also be even more expressive.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We could change this a little bit even more.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We could change this and to an or, for example,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and this would return us all of the links that were submitted by user 5

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or all of the links who have more than 23 votes,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and so you can see SQL is fairly expressive, and you can use and and or,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and you can use equals and greater than or equal to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and less than and all sorts of cool stuff.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.720
And already you can see we can ask fairly sophisticated questions of our database.
