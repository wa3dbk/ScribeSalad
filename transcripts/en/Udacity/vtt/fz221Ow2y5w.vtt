00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
As we saw in that last quiz,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
it's not quite clear what to do when our token definitions overlap.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The 7-character sequence "hello"

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
matches our regular expression for word

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but also matches our regular expression for string.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is a problem not just with computer languages

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but also with natural languages.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
As the hypothetical owner of this restaurant would notice,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
we don't just serve hamburgers, we serve people

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
could be interpreted the wrong way.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Presumably those hamburgers are soylent green flavored.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We want to have definitive rules for figuring out

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which of these we prefer.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
In fact, we're going to use a very simple rule.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The first one you list wins,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the one closer to the top of the file,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so this is our big winner and is going to take priority over string.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If you're making a lexical analyzer for HTML or JavaScript,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
ordering your token definitions is of prime importance.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Let's investigate this issue in the form of a quiz.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Suppose we have the input string hello, "world,"

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and we really want that to yield word,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
the word hello, followed by a string.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm going to list 3 rules for you,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and I want you to tell me which one has to come last

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
for us to get the desired effect.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And here, because you've seen it all before, I'm eliding some of the details

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
like the colon, token, blah, blah, blah.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Instead what I'd like you to do is tell me

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
which one of these functions, which one of these rules,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
would have to come last, bearing in mind that the one that comes first

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
wins all ties in order for hello, "world" to break down into

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
a word followed by a string.
