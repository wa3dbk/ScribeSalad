00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.230
On Windows, I'll open the Command Prompt and cd to the Downloads folder.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.130
And this time I want to use FC to compare game_old.js to game_new.js.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.478
So I'll scroll back up to the top, and I can see that I'm comparing the files,

00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:17.170
game_old.js and game_new.js.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.680
And there's a, a few different changes here.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.110
So I'll have to look through for

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.320
a little bit, but if I scroll down, here's the typo, spacr.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.980
That's not right.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.320
On Mac or Linux, the process is very similar.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.520
I'll open the terminal, cd to the Downloads folder,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.730
then run the command diff -u game_old.js game_new.js.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.060
The diff is in a slightly different format than when I ran this on Windows, but

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.390
the content is the same.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.630
If I scroll back up here's the typo.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.190
I'll go ahead and open the game.js file.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.820
Search for spacr, and here it is.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.460
I'll change it back to space now.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.260
Now I'll go ahead and try out the new controls.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.519
I can move now, but it's harder to play the game since I only have two hands,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.280
because Enter is a bit far from the arrow keys.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.610
I think I'll change the controls back.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.340
Now I'm going to hand you over to Sara to reflect on what you just accomplished.
