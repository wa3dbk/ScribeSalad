00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.020
So, this is how we're going to be able to

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.470
measure the power of a hypothesis space. This is a really

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.010
clever definition. I did not come up with this and it

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.990
goes like this. For a given input and hypothesis space, we're

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.660
going to ask what is the largest set of inputs

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.910
that the hypothesis class can label in all possible ways? So,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.920
in this example that we were looking at, it's actually really

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.030
simple because it turns out the answer is one. so, here,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.790
here's an example. So being able to do this with one is not such a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.320
big deal. If S is a set of points, a set of inputs, in this case

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.910
just six, it's one of the inputs from the set. Then are there hypotheses in the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.000
hypothesis class that can label this in all

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.180
possible ways? Well, there's only two possible ways.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.034
It can label it as true and it can label

00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:51.310
it as false. So, here if we set theta to

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.310
I don't know, five, it'll label it as true. If

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.950
we have a different hypothesis that say sets theta to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.800
eight, then we can label it as false. There is

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.160
a set of inputs of size one that we can

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.770
label in all possible ways. But is there any pair

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.560
of inputs that we can label in all four ways?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.440
&gt;&gt; I'm going to say no.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.070
&gt;&gt; And why is that?

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.842
&gt;&gt; Well because you're writing it, you're writing it

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:15.480
in sets but I sort of think of these as

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.430
points on a number line, and theta as a separating line.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.090
And there's just kind of no way to label

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.580
anything to the left of the line as negative, ever.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.740
Because you're requiring that x is greater than equal to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.110
theta to be positive, so you can never label anything

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.140
to the left of that line as negative. So all

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.960
I have to do, right, is make x1 negative and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.190
x2 positive, and there's nothing you can do. Is that right?

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.070
&gt;&gt; Indeed it is. So, in particular, pick

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.190
any two points x1, x2 on the line just

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.384
like you said, if as we roll theta, if we just kind of consider sets of theta

00:01:51.384 --> 00:01:55.890
as moving from left to right, it starts off where x1 and x2 are both going to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.450
be labeled as true. Then as we move theta

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.150
to the right, x1 is going to eventually start

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.500
to be labeled false, so that okay, that's now two of

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.070
the combinations we've seen. We're going to keep moving theta to

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.560
the right, and now x2 is labeled as false. So we've

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.040
seen three of the combinations, but which combination didn't we see?

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.050
&gt;&gt; true, false.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.020
&gt;&gt; And there's just no way to make that happen. Just like you said.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.080
&gt;&gt; So would you say this is a weak hypothesis space?

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.460
&gt;&gt; It definitely seems to be pretty weak, even though

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.230
it's infinite. In fact, did it depend on x being finite?

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.170
&gt;&gt; No, actually, it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.320
didn't. You're right.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so all, so this really applies in the, in this very

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.640
general setting. We can take this definition, bring it to bear on an input

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.840
hypothesis pair like this, and it gives us a sense of how expressive

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.460
or how powerful the hypothesis space is. And in this case, not very expressive.
