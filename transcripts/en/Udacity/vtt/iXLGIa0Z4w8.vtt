00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so a 100 test cases passed in that tiny amount of times it took us to run.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And so one thing we could conclude is that since a 100 of test passed over read all

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that the logic is solid but it turns out that this conclusion isn't really warranted.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's see if we can get the program to tell us why.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So I'm going to do here is print out a value indicating the number of bytes that was actually

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
read by the raw read system call and then we'll run our testing loop.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And what happens is every single time we called read, it read the full size of the file.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So our splay.py here--we can see that's 3121 bytes and the actual Unix read system call

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
always read that many bytes every time we call it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So it ends being the case even though it's illegal for read to return less bytes than we asked it to read

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is not actually doing this, so what we're going to need to do in order to test our logic

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in any meaningful way is make it do that, and so the question is how to do that.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Well, one way to do that would be to go hack Mac OS so that sometimes doesn't read

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
all the file bytes that we asked and that is not very fun, so we're going to do something a little easier.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We're going to insert faults ourselves by calling a read fault injection file.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
By calling a read function with fault injection is the function I already wrote here, so what you can see

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that read with fault injection does is it has exactly the same interface as read

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
just a different filename, but what it's going to do is instead of reading the nbytes

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that we asked for it's going to set the number of bytes to read to be a random number

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
between 1 and the number of fault bytes inclusive.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And so the +1 there means that instead of going from 0 to the number of bytes minus 1,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we;re going to test the range from 1 to the number of bytes, and that's what we want to do.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We don't want to return 0 because that indicates an end of file condition.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So now we're ready to run some tests.
