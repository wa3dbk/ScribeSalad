Now let's move on to another form of psychotherapy. But first, let me ask you a

00:00:04.148 --> 00:00:08.112
question. Let's say you're a therapist and you had a client with very little

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:11.832
self esteem. Who wouldn't apply for any jobs because they didn't think they

00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:15.398
were good enough. And wouldn't go out on any dates because they didn't think

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:19.555
anyone would ever like them because they're just a worthless individual. How

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:23.862
would you treat your patient? Write your response here. Don't worry, I'm not

00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:27.556
looking for exact wording or anything like that. Just let me know how you'd

00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:28.580
handle this situation.
