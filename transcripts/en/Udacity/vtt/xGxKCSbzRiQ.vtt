00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.170
Let's start with A.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.300
Going up we can see that we're at 2 on the x axis.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.850
And we're at the same level as this point over here.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.940
So we're at 1 on the y axis.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.480
So we've got 2, 1.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.010
Next up looking at B.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.110
We are one line over.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.570
So we know that the x has to be 3.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.420
And we've gone down one, so our y is 2.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.530
Last but not least with C,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.320
we're at 1 on the x axis and we're at now 3 on the y axis.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.730
So we've got 1, 3.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.590
Important to note,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.310
these are not negative numbers, these are positive numbers on the y axis.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.700
The y axis gets more positive the farther down you go.
