00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.860
There are some more subtle issues involved

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.400
in the implementation of the RMI system, including

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.180
distributed garbage collection, dynamic loading of stubs on

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.870
the client side, sophisticated sandboxing mechanisms on the

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.020
client and the server sides to ward off security threats and so on. I encourage

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.650
you to learn about these issues by reading

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.340
the assigned paper and also surfing the Net.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.630
The main point I want to leave you with is that many ideas that start

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.820
out as pie in the sky research becomes usable technology when the time is ripe.
