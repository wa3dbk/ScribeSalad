Thank you for sharing your response. Now, before we continue with

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.620
the course, I want to make sure that you're familiar with

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.820
the prerequisites for the course. We want our students to know

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.210
some basic computing ideas. Ideas like, if statements, loops and function

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.060
definitions. You can demonstrate that you know these ideas by continuing

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.770
to watch this video. And by answering the two questions that

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.010
follow. By the way, if you feel like you need a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.510
refresher on any one of these topics, there are some helpful

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.030
links in the instructor notes. Okay, here is the first question.
