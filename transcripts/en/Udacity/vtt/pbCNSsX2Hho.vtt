00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.250
Let's look at some of

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.740
the new responsibilities you'll have
as the founder of your company.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.050
In an early stage startup,
you'll wear many hats.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.920
You may be the product manager, sales
associate, accountant or something else.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.990
As you grow, you'll give some of these
responsibilities to other people

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.550
like co-founders, employees,
freelancers or outsourcing companies.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.600
During this time you're responsible for
providing resources to your team.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.080
This will help them continue
building the service users love.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.130
To do this effectively, you'll need
to provide both the emotional and

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.240
physical support your team needs.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.210
So what types of emotional
support should you provide?

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.350
Emotionally, you should be able to
communicate what is needed to achieve

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.360
your vision and overcome obstacles
by making the important decisions.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.220
You'll also want to make sure they
feel supported, encouraged, and

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.780
capable of doing their job correctly.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.760
And what are some of
the physical needs of your team?

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.720
They need a place to work from,
even if it's their home.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.940
They need to get paid.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.170
So you'll need some money and
they need equipment like laptops and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.030
infrastructure like servers.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.870
You can ask your team to use their own
equipment will try getting some of

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.370
what you need for

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.860
free which you could get from many
of the existing start up programs.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.480
Moving forward, try to consider how you
plan to provide these resources for

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.580
your team as you continue to grow and
expand your business.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.460
You might need to get creative here, but
take some time to think about what you

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.410
can do to give the emotional and
physical support your team needs.
