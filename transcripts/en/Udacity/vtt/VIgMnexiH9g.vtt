00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.590
So what we're going to look at now is

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.140
the relationship between the inter process communication time and

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.740
both the individual and the mutual clock drift that

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.190
I described to you. Let Mu be the lower

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.300
bound on the inter process communication time. So

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.930
let's now derive the conditions under which we can

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.510
assert that if we have an event A on P I. And in real time, it's supposed to

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.800
precede an event B on Pj. What are the conditions that should hold in terms of

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.550
mu, k, the individual clock drift time, and

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.640
epsilon that is the mutual clock drift time?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.860
This first condition is pretty straightforward, It is

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.460
coming from the fact that Ideally, the clocks

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.590
are perfectly synchronized. You know that at time, real time t, ci of t and cj

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.140
of t should be exactly the same, right? You expect that

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.880
if it is, if the clocks are perfectly synchronized and it is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.330
keeping with real time, ci of t is equal to cj

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.880
of t, equal to t, where t is the real time. But

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.830
they could be in the original clock drift and user clock

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.810
drift, which makes them different from each other. And all that you're

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.040
seeing through this first one is that this is the act of

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.550
sending a message and this is the act of receiving the message.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.340
The time stamp that I'm going to give to this,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.000
the real time that I'm going to give to this

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.940
by reading my clock it better be higher than the

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.410
time at which the message is actually sent. And in

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.910
order to guarantee that we have to look at what

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.770
would be the time that it takes for this message

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.400
to go from here to here. That's coming from this

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.570
mu this lower bound on IPC. So, if the message

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:49.430
is sent at Ci of t with respect to Pi. Then, the time on PI when this message

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.650
is received over here, is going to be CI T plus mu. This is a local reading

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.940
of the clock, when the message would have

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.900
arrived at PJ. So this is the time elapsed

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.630
between sending the message, and when my peers should

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.940
have received the message. So, what we are saying

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.730
is in order for making sure that pj will have a time stamp that is at least

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.370
greater than Ci, you want to make sure that the, the time reading that I have

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.630
on my local clock, t plus mu, should

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.690
be greater than the time reading at the time

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.510
that I sent the message. So the time that I sent the message from Pi my pierce

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.210
time was CG of t and and all that we are saying is in order to make sure that

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.690
there is no anomaly the first condition has to hold that says that. The

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.130
disparity between the two clocks is within this

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.390
interprocess communication plane. That's all this is saying, that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.860
the disparity of the mutual drift is within

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.710
this interprocess communication plane. And the second equation is

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.260
basically a difference equation formulation of the formula that

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.800
I gave you, which I called PC1. And this

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.590
is basically saying that if K is zero when I read the clock at time key plus new

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.070
and see the difference between the clock reading now

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.870
and the clock reading when I read it at

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.220
time T it should exactly be mu. But because

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.840
of the fact that I may have individual clock drift,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.670
it may not be exactly mu, but it

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.240
may be something different from mu. Either more or

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.870
less, but very small difference. And so all

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.540
that we are saying is that the amount of

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.660
individual clock drift should be negligible compared to

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.360
the interprocess communication time. So the first thing is

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.690
saying the interprocess communication time is much bigger than any

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.550
clock drift that exists between two different clocks.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.160
And the second equation is saying that the individual clock drift is very small

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.960
compared to mu. And if we put all these things together, you can derive the

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.780
expression for inter-process communication time. What it

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.480
should be relative to mutual drift and individual

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.150
clock drift. If this inequality is satisfied,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.790
you can avoid anomalies in your distributive system.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.110
So, informally, would you expect this k

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.760
is very very small. Which means the denominator

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.320
is very close to one. So, all that we're saying here is that the mutual

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.340
clock drift, which is represented by epsilon,

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.620
is very small compared to the interprocess communication

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.150
time. Which is what is captured by this apparent condition that I laid out here.
