00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.670
So let's look at the solution
to our RAID1 quiz.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.350
We have a RAID1 array with two disks.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.775
A single disk in this array is
a 200GB disk with a throughput of

00:00:10.775 --> 00:00:14.980
10MB/s and an MTTF = 100,000h.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.340
And when a disk fails we replace it and
it takes us 24h to do that.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.150
So, in a two-disk RAID1, the data
capacity is the same as for one disk.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.320
That's because both disks
are storing exactly the same data,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.950
which allows us to survive
the failure of one disk.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.840
The throughput, when we are reading,
is twice the throughput of a single

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.140
disk because we can issue reads
to both disks at the same time.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.900
But when we are writing,
we are writing to both disks at once.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.235
So the throughput for
writing is only 10MB/s.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.680
If half of the requests are reads and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.580
the other half of the requests
are writes, then in any given second,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.560
we will be spending one-third
of a second on the reads and

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.510
we will be spending two-thirds
of a second on the writes.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.880
That way, we get to do the same number
of reads and writes per second.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.260
It's just that the reads
are twice as fast, so

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.928
they take half the time of
the writes in that same second.

00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:19.690
In the one-third of a second
that we have been doing reads,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.828
we were getting a 20MB/s throughput
because we were using both disks.

00:01:24.828 --> 00:01:29.850
In the two-thirds of a second
when we were doing writes,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.670
we were getting only 10MB/s.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.071
So overall during this one
second using the raid one array,

00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:43.717
we ended up getting
a throughput of 40 over 3MB,

00:01:43.717 --> 00:01:48.256
which gives us
a throughput of 13.33MB/s,

00:01:48.256 --> 00:01:53.787
because in one second,
we managed to access 40 over 3MB.

00:01:53.787 --> 00:01:56.503
So the answer here is 13.33.

00:01:56.503 --> 00:01:59.147
Note that the throughput is not 15MB/s,

00:01:59.147 --> 00:02:03.291
which is what we would get if we
simply average the read throughput and

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:07.120
the write throughput we
would get in this array.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.960
Because if we did this,
we are assuming that for

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.710
a half a second we are reading and then
for half a second we are writing, and

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.610
thus we get 15 MB read and
written in a second.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.320
But if for half a second, we read and
for half a second we write.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.700
We end up reading twice the amount
of data that we would for writes.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.110
So if the workload is 50-50 in terms
of number of accesses, then it's

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.480
not also 50-50 in terms of time spent
on reads and time spent of writes.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.070
Reads are faster,
thus we spent less time on them,

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.930
which is why again
the throughput is not 15MB/s.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.980
And finally, let us figure out
the MTTF for the entire RAID1 array.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.840
The MTTF of a whole RAID1
array with two disks, we set,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.210
is equal to the MTTF of
a single disc divided by two.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.970
So this is how long we have to
operate with two discs until

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.870
one of the discs fails.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.300
And now each time we have a one disc
failure, we need to repair it and

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.230
we said that the number of
times we can try a repair

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.950
until we finally experience a failure
of the second disc during the repair of

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.890
the first disc is MTTF of one disk
divided by the MTTR of the disc.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.280
So this first factor
will be 50,000 hours.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.120
The second factor is the ratio of the
time to failure and the time to repair.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.237
And when we divide these
two we get 4166.666 etc.

00:03:38.237 --> 00:03:42.574
So this is how many times can we try
a repair while a single disk is working

00:03:42.574 --> 00:03:47.830
until we finally experience a repair
in which the working disk also fails.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.520
And when we multiply this out
we get 208,333,333 hours.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.700
So this is a huge amount of time
compared to the original disks MTTF.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.230
As you can see RAID1 dramatically
improves reliability.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.170
This time is about 11 years.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.381
This time is about 24,000 years.

00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:12.365
So as you can see,

00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:16.569
the reliability has improved from being
able to expect data loss every about

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:20.459
10ish years to something that goes
into tens of thousands of years.
