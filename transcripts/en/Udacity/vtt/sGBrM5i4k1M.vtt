00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.765
So now we have what is called
a MOSI coherence protocol.

00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:10.150
MS and I are the same as before,
but now there is a new O state.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:17.110
So the MOSI protocol is like MSI,
except when we are in the M state and

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.200
we snoop a read from the other core,
we provide the data as before.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.000
But we now move into the O state,
not the S state.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.561
When we are providing the data,
the memory now doesn't get accessed.

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:36.040
In MSI, the memory would now need
to be written with the data.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.066
Here, we simply provide
the data to the requester,

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.829
move to the O state without
updating the memory.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.161
While the block is in
the O state in a cache,

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:52.440
it behaves similarly to the S state,
except that if we snoop a read,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.950
we continue to provide the data
just like we did in the M state.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.331
And that we need to write
the data back to memory,

00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:05.128
if the block in the O state
is replaced from that cache.

00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:08.714
And that's because all of the other
caches will have the block in either

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:12.299
invalid or shared state, so they don't
know that the block is dirty and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.930
needs to be replaced.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.546
So the M state indicated both that we
have exclusive read/write access to

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:22.203
the block, nobody else has it and
that the block is dirty.

00:01:22.203 --> 00:01:25.926
S indicated that we had the shared
read access to the block,

00:01:25.926 --> 00:01:30.470
others may also have it in shared
state and that the block is clean.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.996
The memory has an up to date copy.

00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:35.641
Now O combines the properties of M and

00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:40.928
S states in that it is a shared read
access state, but the block is dirty and

00:01:40.928 --> 00:01:44.682
we are responsible for
putting the data in memory and

00:01:44.682 --> 00:01:49.402
also because there is only one cache
with the block in the O state.

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:53.207
That cache knows it can respond to
all the read accesses to the data, so

00:01:53.207 --> 00:01:54.700
that the memory doesn't.
