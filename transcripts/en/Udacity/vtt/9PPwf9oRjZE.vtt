00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So this heap property is a really useful thing, it's going to turn out.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's important to figure out how we can take a bunch of numbers

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and make them satisfy the heap property.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's do that. Let's start figuring out how that will work.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
First thing to notice is that any one-node tree satisfies the heap property

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because it can't be bigger or smaller than the parent or the child

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
cause it doesn't have any parents or child.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That case is really easy, but now, so let's imagine that we've somehow managed to create two heaps

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and we've like to join them together by adding another node and have it the heap property hold.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Both of these subtrees the heap property holds which means the smallest values in the entire heap

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
are sitting here at the top of the relative roots, but now we're adding a new node.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If this node is already smaller, then these two, then everything's fine but it might not be.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It might be that this is a large value.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Let's give an example. So what do we do at this point?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We need a heap property to hold everywhere for this to actually be a heap. So what can we do?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Well, so with respect to these three nodes, we're going to need to change something

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to establish the heap property of this locally.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
First thing we're going to do is we'll introduce some swapping around.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Which value can we swap to the top to move things in the direction of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
more establishing the heap property?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Which of these values should be at the root here? Write the answer in the box.
