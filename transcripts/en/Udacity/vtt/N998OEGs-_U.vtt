00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.080
Of the four pairs of logs down here, there are only two sets that we can

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.800
combine. Log base e of 4 plus ln of 5, and log base 10 of 5 plus log base 10 of

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.505
6. The reason that both of these can be combined in the product property is

00:00:15.505 --> 00:00:20.830
because the bases are the same for the two logs we're trying to add. Here, we

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.080
have log base e and natural log. But we know that ln is actually shorthand for

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.300
log base e. So both of these actually have the same base and we can combine

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.272
them. The same is true for the logs down here. Log base 10 of 5 and log base 10

00:00:37.272 --> 00:00:41.430
of 6, have the same base. Since remember, that's the number that goes down here

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.610
as the subscript of log. The two remaining choices can't be combined because

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.485
the bases of the logs we're trying to add are different. Here we have log base

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:57.540
10 and natural log, which, again, has a base of e. 10 and e are not the same

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.860
number. So, we can't combine these. The same concept applies here. We have a

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.029
base of 2 and a base of 10, so we can't use the product property.
