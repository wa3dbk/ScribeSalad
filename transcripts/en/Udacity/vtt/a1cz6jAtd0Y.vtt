00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.017
Let's see what would happen if the order of rotation and scaling were reversed.

00:00:04.018 --> 00:00:08.186
That is, first we rotate and then we'd scale our sphere. For our clock exercise

00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:13.045
the result would look like this, the rotation seems to have had no effect. Think

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:17.486
about what the order off operations actually does to the object. First we rotate

00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:21.310
the sphere. This has little effect of what we see on the screen. The sphere

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.033
looks pretty much the same from any angle. So by doing the rotation first, we've

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:29.415
essentially lost its effect. Stretching the sphere afterwards gives us the shape

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:33.505
we want but the rotation's already been done. At this point, I want to show you

00:00:33.505 --> 00:00:38.038
a great program for experimentation. The Three.js Interactive Scene Editor. See

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:42.234
the additional course materials for link to this program. To start, let's add a

00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:46.950
sphere to the scene. It comes in black as there's really no lightning of scene.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.848
So let's add a directional light, put it over here. And select our sphere. We

00:00:52.848 --> 00:00:56.550
can move our sphere around. And you can see the change of position over here.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.389
You can also rotate it. And obviously, it doesn't look very different, because

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:05.660
it's a sphere. But you can also non uniformly scale it. So here, we've scaled it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.740
a bit. And I can rotate it, and you can see the effect. Give this program a try.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.156
It's really excellent for figuring out how rotations, scales, and positions work

00:01:14.156 --> 00:01:14.773
together.
