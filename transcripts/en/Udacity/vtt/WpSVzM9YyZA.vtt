00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.590
The /22 represents the length of the network ID, and the

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.650
remaining 10 bits are for host in that /22 prefix. So

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.710
those 10 bits reserved for the host for that /22, mean

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.760
that this /22 prefix represents 2 to the tenth IP addresses.
