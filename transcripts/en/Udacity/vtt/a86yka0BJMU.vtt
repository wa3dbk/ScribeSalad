00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You should be using 1.8 times the original number of steps.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The original error before I change the number of steps would be something like this.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let's call it the old error would be a constant times the old step size to the fourth power.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What I want to achieve is that the new error with the new step size is just the 10th part of this,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and at the same time, because this is supposed to be a solver of order 4,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
this is the same constant as before times the new step size to the fourth power.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So now we've got two equations that involved the old error and that constant C,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
this is the first one, this is the second one,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we can solve for the new step size which is just basic algebra

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and you'll find that the new step size is the old step size divided by the ⁴√10

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and the ⁴√10 is about 1.8.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So we are reducing the step size by a factor of 1.8

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which means that we are increasing the number of steps by that very factor of 1.8.
