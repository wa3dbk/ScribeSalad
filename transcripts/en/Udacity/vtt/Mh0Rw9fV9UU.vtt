00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here I've built a fake internet

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's a little smaller than the real internet, but it'll be a good example

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
for showing how we want to modify the crawler to solve the max pages problem.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The problem asks us to stop the crawler

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
from crawling the internet after we've reached a certain number of pages.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If this were the real internet, there'd be a lot more links. We'd have links going basically practically forever.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There are billions of pages on the internet, and if we took

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the code that we had at the end of this unit,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
then the crawler would go on for a very, very long time.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I leave it up to you to estimate how long it would take,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but longer than this course has time available.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
What we want to do for all practical reasons

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is have the crawler stop after reaching a certain number of pages.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
That's pretty easy to do if we just count the number of pages

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that we've seen as we go through our sample internet and simply check it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
against the max pages passed into the function.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If we say max pages is equal to 3, what our crawler is going to do is start with A.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
&gt;From A, we're going to crawl A, then get B and C.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Then we're going to crawl C, and get D and E,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but we now have crawl 3 pages, so we want to stop the process.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Let's look at the code that we had at the end of the unit and modify it to do exactly this.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Here we have the crawl web function.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We take in a parameter--max pages--

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and we want to stop crawling once we've hit that number of pages crawled.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
An easy way to check is to simply look at the length of the crawled list,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and we get that but using the len operator.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We don't only want to crawl a page if it hasn't been crawled,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but we also only want to crawl it if the length of the crawled list is less than max_pages.
