Let's take a look at how sound works. Now say a bird starts singing

00:00:03.338 --> 00:00:03.702
[SOUND]

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:09.346
and this travels through the air as a sound wave before reaching the ear. The

00:00:09.346 --> 00:00:12.518
sound wave is a analog signal, but in order to represent it on a computer we

00:00:12.518 --> 00:00:17.570
need to convert it to digital information. After it's converted to digital, we

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.480
might want to perform some audio transforms on it. To change the volume.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.292
[NOISE]

00:00:22.292 --> 00:00:26.120
Or apply some other echo effect.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.659
[NOISE]

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.208
Or something much more complicated and awesome

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:30.934
[NOISE].

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:35.722
We can think of all these transforms as a graph of processing notes that each

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:41.143
transform our sound in some way. And you can put them together, and that's

00:00:41.143 --> 00:00:45.796
exactly how Web Audio is structured. In this case, you can take this sound, run

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:50.074
it through a series of nodes to transform it into, for example, a slap-back

00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:54.854
echo effect. Let's take a look at the Web Audio Playground, which is a web

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:58.985
application built by Chris Wilson. It's a great way to visualize how Web Audio

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:02.450
works and you can actually play around with all the different nodes, you can

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.805
create source nodes and add all these different processing nodes to your

00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:11.082
sounds. And you can create that same slap-back effect like this

00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:11.750
[SOUND].

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.998
Now, Web Audio is a node graph that is contained in something called an audio

00:01:19.998 --> 00:01:25.203
context. Everything in the audio context is run natively in high performance

00:01:25.203 --> 00:01:30.152
code, specifically designed for audio processing. Of course, what we see here

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:33.110
is a simple example, a real node graph may look quite complicated, but

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.390
ultimately it's all using the same concepts.
