00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.730
So that's a description of mean
shift as applied to segmentation.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.400
It's a, it's a, I will tell you
it's a very strong technique.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.970
The cool thing is it automatically
finds these basins of attraction.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.320
So, you don't have to tell
it how many modes there are.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.140
You just tell it, in fact there's
one parameter choice essentially,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.003
which is that window size,
how big that Gaussian is.

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:22.780
There's also, when you talk about that,
because you're operating in a feature

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.730
space, you actually have
a distance function, right?

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.730
because when my Gaussian is over
some distance, so if I want to scale

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.060
color more than texture, oh, texture,
we haven't talked about that yet.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.365
All right, we'll do that next.

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:37.985
Or color more than luminance you
make that decision ahead of time.

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:40.945
So, there's this parameter
choice of window size, but

00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:44.435
there's also a, a general
distance metric function choice.

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:47.472
But you have that in every sort
of clustering that you do.

00:00:47.472 --> 00:00:49.962
It doesn't make any assumptions
about the shape of the,

00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:53.082
the segment in the image, or the cluster
in the image, it just does this in the,

00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:55.812
the probability of
the distribution of the pixels.

00:00:55.812 --> 00:00:58.742
And it's a very generic technique for
finding multiple modes,

00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:01.552
and people use mean shift for
a variety of things like tracking,

00:01:01.552 --> 00:01:05.251
when we actually talked
about doing that previously.

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:09.042
You know, as in anything else
there are some down sides.

00:01:09.042 --> 00:01:10.881
It does depend on this window size, and

00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:13.612
sometimes figuring out that
window size is a bit of an art,

00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:17.710
with respect to the nature of the set
of the images that you're looking at.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.310
And, the other problem is, because you
are sort of moving in feature space, oh,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.110
and, and, you want to make sure that
you get a reasonable number of points

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.420
within your, your region of interest
in order to shift the mean.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.542
Well, suppose you've got
a big feature space.

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:38.708
All right, and what I mean by that
is you've got fifty dimensions.

00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:43.330
Well, almost by definition,
your future space will be sparse, right?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.190
Because the, sort of,
the number of little, if you,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.610
if you let's suppose you carved
up every dimension into,

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.830
like, ten buckets, well,
if there's fifty dimensions right?

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.170
That's ten to the 50th buckets.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.099
So by definition,
there's going to be lots and

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:00.950
lots of buckets that have
hardly any points in them.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.630
So mean shift needs you to
have a reasonable number of

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.300
points within that region, so it doesn't
work as well in high dimensions.
