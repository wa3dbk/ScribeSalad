00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.130
The solutions are negative 2 plus 3 root 2, and negative 2 minus 3 root 2.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.790
Great thinking if you found those two answers. We start by taking the square

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.178
root of both sides of our equation. The square root of the quantity x plus 2

00:00:14.178 --> 00:00:18.666
squared is just x plus 2. And when we take the square root of 18, we pick up

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:23.412
the negative root. So we have plus or minus the square root of 18. Next we

00:00:23.412 --> 00:00:28.604
isolate x, or get it alone by subtracting 2 from both sides. We don't have

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:32.444
light terms here, so we have x equal to negative 2 plus or minus the root of

00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:36.968
18. We simplify our square root of 18 by breaking into 9 times 2 and take the

00:00:36.968 --> 00:00:42.376
square root of 9 to get our final answer. And do keep in mind there's really

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:46.840
two answers here: we have negative 2 plus 3 root 2 and negative 2 minus 3 root

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.570
2. Both of these values will check if we plug them into our original equation.
