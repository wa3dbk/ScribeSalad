00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.506
So we'll start with the steps.

00:00:01.506 --> 00:00:05.483
Intuitively, we're doubling the size of the communication on every step

00:00:05.483 --> 00:00:07.721
until we reach the size of the input.

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:12.776
This goes 1 hop, this goes 2 hops, this goes 4 hops over, and so on.

00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:15.892
So if that sounds to you like some sort of log, you're right.

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:21.870
There are exactly log n steps to compute this scan. So our step complexity is log n.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.794
So now we turn to computing the amount of work that we're going to do.

00:00:24.794 --> 00:00:28.562
And the way we're going to do that is we're going to think about this matrix that we drew

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:31.115
as a big rectangle and we're going to say,

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:34.959
well, at every point in this rectangle we're doing a computation.

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:38.749
Some of those computations are adds. Some of those computations are copies.

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:42.771
It turns out that if you just consider the adds, the analysis ends up being the exact same.

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.130
But we're going to say the total amount of work we do,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.532
the total number of computations, is simply the area of this rectangle.

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:50.461
So how big is this rectangle?

00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:55.802
Well, in the x direction, the rectangle is n items. We're scanning an array of n items.

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:59.869
We already computed what the y size of this rectangle is.

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:02.651
That's log(n), the number of steps that we have.

00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:06.852
So the product of those 2 is going to give us the work complexity.

00:01:06.852 --> 00:01:10.490
And so the work complexity here is O(n log n).
