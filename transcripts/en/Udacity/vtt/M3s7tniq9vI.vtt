00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.600
A protocol is also a type.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.800
You can use a protocol name in all
of the places you would normally use

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.840
any other type.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.560
To describe variables, constants, and
properties, to indicate parameter and

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.010
return types, and to indicate
the item types in a collection.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.020
Here's a class called DinnerCrew.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.380
This DinnerCrew is very egalitarian and
inclusive.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.430
All of its members need to implement
the Sous Chef protocol, but

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.830
otherwise they could be of any class,
enum, or struct.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.268
So we specify the members
array property like this.

00:00:29.268 --> 00:00:32.870
We write Souschef where we would
otherwise write the type of the items in

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.481
the array.

00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:36.990
And we do the same for
the parameters in the init method.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.240
But Sous Chef is in the class itself or
a struct.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.805
How can it be capable of making dinner?

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:45.500
Sous Chef has no logic of its own.

00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:49.890
To specify Sous Chef
as a type is to say,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.170
I don't care what type goes here as
long as it adopts a Sous Chef protocol.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.290
Here, you can see that it doesn't
matter if I initialize a DinnerCrew

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.040
with a random passer by or a roommate.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.360
As long as each member implements
the Sous Chef protocol.
