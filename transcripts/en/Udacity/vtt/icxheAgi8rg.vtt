00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.610
When using transparency for materials we set the color's Alpha

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.200
value to specify an object's opacity. You might have a red

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.980
material and the Alpha is used to make it semitransparent.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.570
When used for texturing, we often think of the Alpha as

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.030
the amount of coverage. For example, to create a cut-out

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.740
leaf, you could specify for each textile whether the leaf is

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.090
visible or not. An alpha of one or zero. However,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.788
you can get a better result by specifying an alpha between

00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:27.640
one and zero for textiles on the edge of a

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.310
leaf. Each edge textiles Alpha represents how much the lease

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.280
covers that particular textual. For example, this textile was covered

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.470
by 6 10 of a leaf, so its alpha would

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.460
be 0.6. What's interesting here is that a single alpha

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.890
value is used for both opacity and coverage. It can

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.390
even mean both at the same time. You could have

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.163
a cut-out figure whose textile has a 0.6 coverage and

00:00:51.163 --> 00:00:56.020
a 0.7 opacity to get a 0.42 alpha. Whatever

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.759
the interpretation, we use the same over blending equation

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:01.980
when putting one object the top another. Using alpha

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.080
for coverage is a simplification. For example, when we have

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.460
just alpha value, we don't know the true area

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.810
covered by an object. Combining a few coverages together

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.420
is something of a best guess when we use

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.190
blending. This is usually a fine assumption under normal circumstances,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.860
where only a few pixels have multiple overlapping edges.
