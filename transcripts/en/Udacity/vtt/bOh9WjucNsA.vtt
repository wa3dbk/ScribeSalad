One last thing I'd like to talk about with br and

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.480
p, I'll show you right now. Let's let's make this all be

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.100
one line again, okay? So I update this and we have

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.660
one line. If we, we can put a br tag in the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.780
middle of this. We don't actually have to have the line

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.031
breaks in our HTML. So when I click Update, we, we get

00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:22.670
our, our line break no matter how the HTML is formatted. So,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.230
we can format this however we want, put all of these spaces

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.980
in here. And when we update this, it'll always come out the

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.920
same. There's an example. All this white space turns into turns into one single

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.155
space. All of these new lines here, turn into one

00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:45.538
single space. You know, this text space is really, you know, you get

00:00:45.538 --> 00:00:50.920
the idea. Okay. Why do we have two different ways of making

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.643
new lines? Why do we have a br tag and a

00:00:53.643 --> 00:00:57.277
p tag? The answer is because the br tag is what

00:00:57.277 --> 00:01:00.849
we call inline, and the p tag, is what we call

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:05.410
block. Now, so what the br tag was actually doing was

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.870
just ending a line. So when we have some text and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.790
we put a br in the middle of it, it just

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.210
basically says the line ends here and this guy wraps to

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.160
the next line. The p tag works differently. The p tag

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.370
actually makes an invisible box. So when we have HTML

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.910
looks like this, this creates an actual box. So instead

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.640
of just rendering text, blank line, what this is actually

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.420
rendering is something sort of like this. Here, we've got

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.420
two lines of text and there's actually this invisible box

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.310
around text. And that's what the p tag does, is

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.870
it makes this invisible box. And this invisible box can

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.620
actually have height, and it can have width, where inline elements

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.510
are just text. So the example over here would be

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.848
more like this. So it's just two lines of text and

00:01:46.848 --> 00:01:49.910
there's really just a little new line here. There's nothing nothing

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.410
fancy going on. And the difference between inline and block elements

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.440
will come up a fair amount later in this course

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.478
and it's just it's important to know that there's a distinction

00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:03.810
and they have kind of a different behavior. So far, all

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.160
of the elements we've learned other than p are inline elements.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.880
So, inline elements are b, em, even img is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.770
an inline element. And we saw how, before, our our little Hipmunk image appeared

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.160
right in the middle of the text. That's because it's inline. And

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.130
so far, the only block element we've learned is the p element.
