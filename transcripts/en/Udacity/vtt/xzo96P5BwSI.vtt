00:00:00.178 --> 00:00:04.303
Now that you have a high level overview of the data visualization process, let's

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:08.334
dive a little bit deeper into how we might start collecting data for ourselves.

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:11.343
&gt;&gt; But before we dive deeper into learning about getting cleaning data,

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:13.360
I want to you hear from Scott Murray again.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.460
Scott is going to share with you one common misconception that people have

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.310
about data visualization.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.220
What are the most common mistakes that you see people make when they're

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.950
just starting with data visualizations?

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.240
&gt;&gt; Well the, yeah,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.390
most common is probably thinking that it's mostly about visualization.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.740
Because that's like the fun, pretty, cool, exciting part for most people.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.380
It's, typically there's a lot of like the data part that's involved.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.500
You know, like maybe your work is going to actually be 90% finding the data,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.410
verifying the data,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.090
parceling the data, filtering the data like exploring the data.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.460
And the visualization is often just kind of like that last step.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.120
Which can sometimes be really disheartening especially if you're you know,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.120
coming in expecting to like, make great graphics or whatever, which you can,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.870
but there's sort of all this leg work that, that happens right before that.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.770
So, that's kind of, I think one, one issue is about expectations coming in.
