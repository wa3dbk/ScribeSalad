00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.540
The correct answer or at least the answer I'm looking

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.190
for is query the database. This step querying the database, that

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.850
means we're leaving our program and making a request to this

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.870
other system, which in the leading nature of my description is

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.380
obviously not as fast as these other things. And in

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.480
the real world the databases almost always the slowest piece. Sometimes

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.870
you don't have a database. But when you do, it's almost

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.450
always the slowest piece. And improving the speed of your database

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.330
is something that's pretty important.
