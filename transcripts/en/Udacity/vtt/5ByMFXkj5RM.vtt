00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.060
With this recurrence defined, we are now
ready for the Floyed-Warshall Algorithm.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.420
Note that if we were to simply
implement this with recursion,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.210
we would do a lot of recomputation.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.480
Delta u k, k minus one would be
computed for every vertex v.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.620
And delta k, v,
k minus 1 would be computed for

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.490
every vertex u, in every iteration.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.520
As you might have guessed,
we're going to fill out a table.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.090
The sub problems here
have three indices, but

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.089
thankfully, only two will be
required for us in the algorithm.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.563
We create a two-dimensional table,

00:00:35.563 --> 00:00:40.210
d, indexed by the source and
destination vertices of the path.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.770
We initialize it for k equals 0,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.860
where there are no vertices allowed,
just based on the edges.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.170
Then we add potential
intermediate vertices one by one,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.159
in this outer loop here.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.000
For each source destination pair
we account for the possibility of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.090
using k as an intermediate vertex,
with this update equation.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.250
Note that when i or j is equal to
k this weight here won't change,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.930
since a vertex can't be useful
in the shortest path to itself.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.570
Hence, we don't need to worry about
using outdated value in this loop here.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.260
To extract not just the weights
of the shortest paths, but

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.810
also the paths themselves, we keep a
predecessor table, which we'll call pi,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.450
that contains the second to last
vertex on a path from u to v.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.460
Initially, when all paths
are just single edges,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.920
this is just the other
vertex on the incident edge.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.510
In the update phase, we either
leave the predecessor alone, or

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.750
if we are going to change the path,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.370
then we switch it to the predecessor of
the second half of the path from k to j.
