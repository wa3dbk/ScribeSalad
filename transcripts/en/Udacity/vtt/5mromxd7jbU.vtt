00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here I've defined some test examples, and here I've written a simple test function.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What does it do? It iterates through each of the possible examples.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It prints out what the example is, the original formula.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Then it uses the time call function that we defined in the previous lesson.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It calls solve on the example and gets back the time it took and the possible results

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and prints that out.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Then in the end it prints out the total elapsed time

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and does that by starting a timer at the start and taking a time at the end

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and just calculating the difference.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's going to tell me for each example what the answer is,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
how long it took for that example, and how long it took for all of them together.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Here is the results of the test.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
For each example, we see the example printed,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
then the filled in example found, and you can verify that that is, in fact, correct.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It took a tenth of a second or so.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Some of them take less. When there's only one variable it's really fast.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Here we find these Pythagorean triplet's of 3-squared plus 4-squared equals 5-squared,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and 5-squared plus 12-squared equals 13-squared.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Notice that we've gone beyond the most simple of cryptarithmetic problems,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which were just word plus word equals another word.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Here we can allow division and exponentiation.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Over here I've been even more complicated where I've come up with A&lt;b&gt;N plus B&lt;/b&gt;N equals C**N,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and N is greater than 1.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The lowercase letters I have not translated, because I said the only letters

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that count as being translated by digits are going to be the upper case ones,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
so I can use any of this Python syntax like the and operator.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Now, if you can find a solution for this when N is greater than 2, I want you to let me know.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But here I found one when N is greater than 1.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I've split the atom. I've determined that all that glitters is not gold.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I've determined that 1 is less than 2 and 4 is less than 5.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You can see a bunch of other equations that I've been able to process,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
including ODD plus ODD equals EVEN.

00:02:27.000 --> 99:59:59.999
And for these 14 different examples it took 2 seconds. Not too bad.
