00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.570
So here's one way to define make_hashtable. We're going to start by

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.710
initializing a variable i = 0. So we're going to start by creating

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.940
an empty table and what we want to do is add

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.520
n buckets, number of buckets to the table. So we're going to use

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.500
a while loop and we're going to loop while i is less

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.110
than number of buckets. So each time that I want to go

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.000
through the loop what we want to do is add on empty

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.770
bucket to our hash table. So we can do that using Append.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.130
That adds a new empty bucket and we need to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.850
remember to increase I to make sure that we don't

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.160
keep looping forever. So we're going to go through this

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.710
loop nbuckets number of times each time adding an empty bucket

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.030
to the table and then we need to return the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.660
table at the end. So let's try that in the Python

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.040
interpreter. So here's the code just like we read out

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.920
and we'll print out the result of making a hash table.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.670
We'll keep the number of buckets small for printing. For a real

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.710
use were going to want to have many more than three buckets. And let's

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.330
run that. And we see what we got is a list with

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.519
three empty lists as it's elements. So this works okay. It seems like

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.980
a lot more code than we need. And it is more code

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.210
than we need. There's a better way to write this, which is to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.900
use a four loop. So, the general structure we've seen for four

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.000
loops. Alright. We've seen a loop that has, has a structure like this,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.540
where the collection could be a list. It could be

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.520
a string. [SOUND] To have a four loop, we need some

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.180
set of objects that we're looping through. In this case, what

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.150
we want to do is loop through the numbers from 0 to

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.510
n buckets minus 1. So we want to create a list

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.590
that contains those values. So we, what we would like in

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.840
order to be able to define a procedure like make hash

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.330
table, is to have a list, which is the numbers from

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.530
0 to n buckets minus 1. Python provides an easy

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.110
way to do that, its called range. So range takes

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.150
two numbers, as inputs. The start and the stop number.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.100
And what it outputs is a list of all the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.830
numbers from start up to stop minus 1. So this

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.470
is what ranges outputs, a list of numbers, starting from

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.957
start. Increasing by 1, until we get to stop minus

00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:06.340
1. We'll note that it doesn't include the value passed

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.919
in is the second parameter in the list. This turns

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.470
out to be useful because oftentimes when we look through

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.390
elements, we don't want to include the last element. So

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.310
that means if we evaluated something like range 0,10, the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.250
result would be the list 0,1,2, up to 9. So

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.210
now that we know about range. We could change our loop

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.160
here. Instead of having this while loop, we could do

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.360
the for loop. And we prefer this for two reasons. The

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.590
first is it's going to make our code shorter. Anytime we

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.130
can make code shorter, that's usually a good thing. The second

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.430
is, it saves us from the danger of forgetting to increment

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.440
the variable. This is a common mistake, and when we forget

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.740
to increment the variable, the loop's just going to run forever. So

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.050
if we can write our while loops as for loops, that's usually

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.530
a good idea. So a better way to define the catch table

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.770
is to use the for loop. We're no longer going to need the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.490
variable i. We still need table and now instead of using a

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.400
y loop we're going to use a for loop. We're going to leave the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.780
variable name blank for a second, we'll figure out what to put

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.570
there later, and what we're looping through. Is from the range from

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.720
0 up to nbuckets. So we want to look through the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.350
elements of the list range to nbuckets. That's going to be the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.800
list of numbers from zero to nbuckets, minus 1. And for

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.050
each one of those we want to append, one new bucket to

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.540
the table, just like we did before. We don't need

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.880
to increment i, there's not i variable now. And at the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.440
end of the loop, we return the table just as before.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.950
For this loop, we didn't actually need a variable here, right?

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.550
We never used the variable inside. For this index of the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.320
four loop, well, we still need something here, so I'm just

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.280
going to call the variable unused. To make it clear that we

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.670
have a name there. We don't actually use it in the body

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.100
of the formula. So this makes the code a lot smaller.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.730
It will work the same way as what we had before.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.290
So here's the new code. Several lines shorter than what we

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.240
had before. Does exactly the same thing. If you were really clever,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.630
you might have thought of an even shorter way.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.620
To define make hash table, that unfortunately doesn't quite

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.140
work. So the shorter way would be to guess,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.300
that the times operator works on list, the same

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.680
way it worked on strings. So we could do

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.339
this by creating empty list, times nbuckets. This seems

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.710
great, it's only one line, really clear and easy

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.690
to understand, and it looks like it almost works.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.250
So let's try that in the Python interpreter. And it looks like

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.170
it worked, we've got a hash table, a list with three empty

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.790
buckets. There's one big problem with this approach, and I'll show you

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.340
a hint why it is, and then we'll have a quiz to see

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.550
if you can figure out why. So now instead of just printing

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.460
out the result. We're going to assign it to a variable called table, and

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.220
now we're going to mimic what would happen when we add something to

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.760
the hashtable. That means we're going to add something to one of the buckets.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.300
Let's pick bucket one, and let's assume

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.470
we're going to add the entry for udacity with

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.870
one url. And now we can print out

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.950
what's in that bucket. Looks like everything is

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.870
okay. What about what's in bucket zero? Now

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.420
we get the same result. So, think about

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.790
what went wrong. I'm going to ask a quiz to see if you can understand why this

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.610
simpler definition of make hash table doesn't actually work correctly.
