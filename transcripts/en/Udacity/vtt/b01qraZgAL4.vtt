Let's consider a different equation, y equals negative 5x squared. We know the

00:00:06.312 --> 00:00:11.239
vertex for this parabola will be at the origin, 0,0. We can easily see that,

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:16.293
since every we plug in an x value of zero, zero squared will be zero. And zero

00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:21.408
times negative 5 would give us a y value equal to zero. But what are some other

00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:25.799
points on the graph. What I'd like you to do is use the a value to determine

00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:30.764
two other points that are on this parabola. When you think you've got them,

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:33.300
check them off on the graph.
