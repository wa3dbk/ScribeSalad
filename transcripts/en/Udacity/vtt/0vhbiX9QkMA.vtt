00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, for a real quiz.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Why is simplifying test cases important in debugging.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Is this so because a simplified test case is easier to communicate?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Or is this so because a simplified test case usually means smaller fixes?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Or because it usually means smaller program states?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Or because it usually means fewer program steps?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Check all that apply. Over to you.
