00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.330
Some of my very favorite bug stories of all time are related to the F-16 fighter plane.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.950
It turns out that when the F-16 was conceived,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.680
it had a very interesting feature.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.020
Whenever it would fly and fly and cross the Equator,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.550
the plane would instantly flip on its backside and keep on flying.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.600
This, fortunately, only happened in simulation.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.170
But imagine what would have happened in real life.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.420
Well, the F-16 can actually fly on its back for hours and hours.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.130
It turns out that this was a signage bug in the navigation system.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.300
Picture what would have happened if this navigation system

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.870
had been used for commercial airlines.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.910
If you see the Fasten Seat Belt sign, yes, be sure to keep your seat belt on at all times.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.500
Another nice bug story is related to Google's Android operating system for mobile phones.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.190
One of the first versions of Android had a diagnostic mode turned on

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.180
where an engineer would be able to use the serial port to enter arbitrary UNIX commands.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.850
Interestingly enough, if the phone would not detect a device on the serial port,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.320
it would fall back to the built-in keyboard instead.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.320
What this meant was that anything you entered on the keyboard

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.760
was also interpreted as a UNIX command.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.470
This was discovered when somebody got an SMS asking him, "What did you do all day?"

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.170
and he answered, "Reboot."

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.100
And lo and behold, with this command the phone rebooted.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.950
Picture this: Anything you say is interpreted as a UNIX command.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.880
He could also have said, "Remove files," or "Drop database," or whatever.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.050
This was very, very quickly fixed.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.220
Here's another really mysterious bug.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.740
I had a program and the program crashed.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.770
So far, so good.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.300
So I inserted a print statement in order to figure out what was going on.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.320
To my big amazement, after I inserted the print statement, the bug was gone.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.440
Classical Heisenberg.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.810
What was even better, I removed the print statement again

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.140
and the bug still was gone.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.000
Now, that's an interesting way to fix bugs.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.980
What was going on there?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.760
It turned out this was a problem in the linker.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.650
The linker had 2 modes.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.760
It had an incremental mode in which you would simply link in changes,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.370
and it had a non-incremental mode where it would start linking from scratch.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.370
And if I made a small change to the program, it would go into the incremental mode.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.270
In the incremental mode the bug was not triggered.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.320
So this is why in the first attempt, in the non-incremental mode, the bug came to be

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.500
and later, in the incremental mode, the bug was turned off again.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.380
But this was hard to work around.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.570
Essentially, what I did was I made a comment in the build script

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.200
that would trigger the incremental mode by simply linking twice.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200
And this is how we worked around the bug.
