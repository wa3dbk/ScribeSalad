00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.860
Let's take a look at this identity right here. We have log base a of AB is

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.940
equal to log base a of A plus log base a of B. Now, is this true in general for

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.406
any base a? And indeed, it is. The formal name of this, is the product

00:00:17.406 --> 00:00:21.424
property. And since we know this is a property of logs in general, logs of any

00:00:21.424 --> 00:00:26.500
base, we know that it is true for the natural logarithm as well. Put simply,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.595
the log of a product is the sum of the logs of the numbers that were multiplied

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:36.252
to make that product. Let's use this rule, but in reverse to find log base 10

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:41.629
of 2 plus log base 10 of 5. First, simplify this into the log of one number,

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.809
and then tell me what that's equal to. Please try this without a calculator

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.945
first, but definitely feel free to check it to make sure it, that it works with

00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:50.922
your calculator.
