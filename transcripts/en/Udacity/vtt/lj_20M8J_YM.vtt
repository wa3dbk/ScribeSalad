00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.780
Today, one of the major physical
constraints on computing platforms

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.850
is power.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.210
You may be familiar with this
fact if you've taken, say,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.950
a computer architecture class.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.560
Even so, let me give you my
take on the basic problem here,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.130
perhaps by way of review for
some of you.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.590
This is a well known chart created in
2001 by Pat Gelsinger, then at Intel.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.200
The chart tracked power per unit area,
or

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.890
power density across several
generations of Intel's microprocessors.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.760
It tracked these up until about 2001,
the time of the talk, and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.950
then extrapolated into the future.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.380
So what is power?

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.342
Power measures the rate of energy
burned or consumed per unit time.

00:00:37.342 --> 00:00:42.210
Power is usually measured in units of,
say, Joules per second or watts.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.170
Now as it happens, the way people
used to make sequential computers

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.410
run faster up until the early OTTs
was to increase the clock rate.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.750
But as you'll see momentarily,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.660
when you do that, Gelsinger's prediction
was that the amount of power per unit

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.340
area would skyrocket, almost literally,
and we know today how the story ended.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.080
Basically, in the early OTTs, people
stopped increasing the clock rate and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.230
went multi-core.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.570
Let's see why.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.350
Let's look more closely at the power
consumed by a computer program.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.140
This chart comes from real data
that one of my former graduate

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.500
students collected.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.040
That student was Jee Choi, shown here
doing what I gather is actual science.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.030
The chart shows measured power
taken at a bunch of samples

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.000
while the application was running.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.140
You can see that there's
some fluctuation.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.380
Presumably the power behavior of the
application is changing as it's doing

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.360
different things.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.470
A computing system at some
point in time has two parts.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.290
I will call the first
part constant power.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.580
Constant power is basically some
baseline amount of power that

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.510
the application or

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.590
the computing system consumes,
independent of what it's doing.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.220
Now, you may have heard
the term static power and

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.355
idle power being bandied
about in your daily life.

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:55.880
Because I mean, who doesn't walk into
a grocery store or yoga studio and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.990
hear people always talking about
static power this or idle power that?

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.020
Very roughly speaking,
constant power is a general term

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.090
that I'll use to encompass things
like static and idle power.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.880
And if you don't know what I'm
talking about, just remember,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.600
constant power is baseline power.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.230
Now, suppose a computation runs.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.730
Depending on what parts of the system
it's using, the power above and

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.320
beyond constant power will fluctuate.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.420
Let's call those
fluctuations dynamic power.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.700
Ew!
Well, maybe not that dynamic.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.070
Now real life circuits can be much more
complex than this simple model suggests.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.710
But let's not worry about that.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.710
Instead, let's take a cue from
the famous statistician George Box.
