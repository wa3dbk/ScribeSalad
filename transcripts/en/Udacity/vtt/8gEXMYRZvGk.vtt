00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.822
So thinking back to our case study, if
instead of subtracting this quantity 3w +

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:09.292
12n, we wanted to add it, it would
effectively be the same as, for example,

00:00:09.396 --> 00:00:14.198
getting another three orders for wiper
blades and another 12 orders for nozzles.

00:00:14.302 --> 00:00:19.423
So, we would be adding new orders to the
original number of orders that he had. And

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:24.361
therefore he would make more money in the
end. We know that some of that money would

00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:29.390
come from the wiper blade orders, and some
of it would also come from the nozzles. So

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:34.146
we want to add both those quantities to
the original expression. So, that means

00:00:34.158 --> 00:00:38.769
that both of the terms, 3w and 12n. Should
be positive. So the answer is 3w plus 12n.

00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:43.027
So you can see the difference here between
having a negative sign, or a minus sign,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.098
in front of something inside parentheses
versus having a plus sign in front of

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.088
something inside parentheses. The minus
sign up here ends up applying to both

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.216
terms that were inside the parentheses,
but down here. We didn't actually change

00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:59.058
the sign of either term that is in the
parenthesis. Keep this in mind as we move

00:00:58.833 --> 00:00:59.833
forward.
