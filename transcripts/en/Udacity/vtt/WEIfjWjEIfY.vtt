00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.900
This is a sandwich. It's not a regular

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.050
sandwich. It's a little bit bigger than the

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.210
regular sandwich, but it looks delicious. So why

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.150
am I telling you this? Well, datastore is like

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.610
a sandwich. It has layers, each layer built

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.250
on top of the other for support. We have

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.690
covered a lot of layers in lesson four

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.080
and we only have two more layers to cover.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.270
So, keep the good work up. As for me, I'm eating a sandwich.
