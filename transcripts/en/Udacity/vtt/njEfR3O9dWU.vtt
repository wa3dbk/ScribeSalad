00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's restate our protocol.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Alice starts by generating a large prime--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we've seen how she can use that using the Rabin-Miller primality test--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
finding a primitive root--we haven't seen how to compute that,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but there are efficient ways to do it--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and selecting a random secret in the range 1 to the value of her prime-- -1.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Then she computes the value of raising g to that power mod q,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
sends that to Bob, and I'm showing in this version of the program I'm sending

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
bot the prime and the primitive root.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Those could've been agreed on earlier in public. Nothing secret about them.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Then Bob computes his value, selecting his random secret

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and computing yb.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
At the end they can both compute the same key,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
raising their respective values to the appropriate powers.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So we've assumed so far an eavesdropper--a passive attacker--

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
who can hear all the messages on this channel but can't disrupt the channel.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What happens if we have an active attacker?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
An active attacker can change messages on this channel.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
instead of just intercepting them and listening to them--eavesdropping on the message--

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
they can intercept and change the messages.

00:01:04.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Is this protocol secure against an active attacker who can modify messages in transit?
