00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This number would be 0.0005 per day and person. Let's do the computation.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's look at the given data. What do we know about each infected person?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
As every other person, each infected person that meets 25 persons a day.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
All this susceptible persons can be infected, so the question is how many

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
susceptible persons are among these 25?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can compute that by ratio.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If there are 1,000 people in total, then the ratio of the number

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
of susceptible persons divided by the total of 1,000 persons

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
times these 25 persons that would be susceptible.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Imagine, everybody was susceptible then we would compute 1,000 persons times 25.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
All 25 would be susceptible. If every second person was susceptible, 500 divided by 1,000

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
results in one half times 25, every second person would be susceptible.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So this is the number of contacts between a single infected person and susceptible persons per day

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and each of these contacts will lead to infection with a probability of 2%.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So now, we can compute how many persons are infected by the single infected person per day

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
versus the number of contact of susceptible persons per day and multiply with probability.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This will be the number of new infections per day.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We can cancel the persons, these three numbers combine to 0.0005 per day

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and per infected person, and that's precisely the expression we are needing in the SIR equations.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Constant times the number of susceptible persons times the number of infected persons.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But keep in mind that we are dealing with average values here,

00:01:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
25 persons per day give or take a probability of 2%, things can occur more often or less often.
