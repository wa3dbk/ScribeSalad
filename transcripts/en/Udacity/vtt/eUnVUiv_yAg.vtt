00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:07.950
The inverse of this function would be negative 1,5, 3, negative 2, and 2,6.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.238
Great thinking if you found these three coordinates. Now, what you want to

00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:17.694
notice is that the inputs and the outputs switch for the inverse function. In

00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:21.513
other words, notice how a, b, and c were always the input for the first

00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:27.539
function we looked at. Whereas in the inverse function, a, b and c were all

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.284
outputs. Another way of thinking about it is that the x and y coordinate always

00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:40.060
switched. So, here for x I had a, and for y I had 2. In the inverse function

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.750
the x value is 2 and the y value is a. This is also true for these other two

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.655
points. The x value and the y value switched. The same was true for this last

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:58.270
point. So, to find this inverse function we simply switch the x and the y

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.444
values for each coordinate pair. That's how we wind up with this function. Keep

00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:09.994
in mind that inverse functions undo the original function. So, if I put in 5, I

00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:15.369
get an output of negative 1. So, to undo that, when I put in my negative 1 to

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.480
my inverse, I want to get out the output of 5, the original input.
