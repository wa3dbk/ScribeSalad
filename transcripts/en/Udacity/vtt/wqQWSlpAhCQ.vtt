00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.342
So, for example, the simple projectile class defines an onTouch function that

00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:06.760
does some crazy things. Now, I'm going to walk through them, so that you can

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.430
see, the type of logic that can occur here. First off, we ensure that we have a

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.830
physics body, to make sure that the onTouch function isn't being called

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.500
erroneously. In addition, we also ensure that the other physics body that's

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.600
being handed to us is valid, and it has user data as well. Otherwise it might

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.320
be an invalid object or a wall or some other static trigger object. Finally, we

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.788
can actually call otherBody.GetUser entity Data to actually get the entity from

00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:31.966
the game engine that responds to this physics object. Now, this simple

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:35.053
projectile class will actually spawn an impact visual when it hits another

00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:38.938
object, a wall or the face of a robot. This nice little block of code here

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:42.337
defines whether or not we've actually defined an impact collision. And then

00:00:42.337 --> 00:00:45.002
it'll go through and actually spawn an InstancedEffect object and allow it to

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:48.845
start doing its flip book animation. Once this is done, it actually calls the

00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:52.215
dealDmg function on the game engine. This will actually reduce the health of

00:00:52.215 --> 00:00:54.960
the physOwner, or the other object that we're running into, by the amount

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.752
specified by this object. This allows the missile to reduce the health of any

00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:03.530
other robot that it hits. Once this is done, we set the markForDeath flag equal

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.230
to true so that later on, our entity will be cleaned up using our sweeping

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.810
process.
