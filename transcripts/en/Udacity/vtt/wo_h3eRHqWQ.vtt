00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.156
Another behavioral technique that involves exposing a person to the feared

00:00:04.156 --> 00:00:09.085
stimulus is flooding. Flooding is based on the response prevention principle.

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:13.629
Flooding involves prolonged exposure to the feared stimulus, which in turn

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.440
provides maximum opportunity for the fear to be extinguished. Now, unlike

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.472
systematic desensitization, which slowly exposes a person to a stimulus,

00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:29.142
flooding does it all at once. Now, at times, flooding can actually make a

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:33.623
phobia worse and it has to be used carefully. For example, with people with

00:00:33.623 --> 00:00:38.159
medical conditions. And you can't use it with all types of phobias. For

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:39.340
example, house fires.
