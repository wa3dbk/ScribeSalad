00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.969
Here, the solutions were 2 plus the square root of 10 or 2 minus the square

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.870
root of 10. Nice work if you got these two answers. So first, we add 6 to both

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.130
sides of our equation, so we can set up the left side to complete the square.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.198
To complete the square, we're going to add b over 2 squared to both sides of

00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:23.472
our equation. The b here is negative 4. So, b over 2 would be negative 2 and b

00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:28.614
over 2 squared would be positive 4. Now, we're ready to write the left-hand

00:00:28.614 --> 00:00:32.720
side as a perfect square. Since our b term is negative, we know we're going to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.378
need x minus a number. It turns out it's x minus 2. Now you can either get that

00:00:38.378 --> 00:00:41.612
by thinking about what binomial squared would give us this trinomial or you can

00:00:41.612 --> 00:00:46.530
just pull it from this b over 2. This is negative 2, so we use that in our

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.665
binomial. Now that we have our perfect square, we take the square root of both

00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:53.878
sides of the equation and we add two do both sides of our equation to solve for

00:00:53.878 --> 00:00:58.778
x. And we know we can't simplify the swuare root of ten since there's not a

00:00:58.778 --> 00:01:01.470
perfect square that divides into ten evenly
