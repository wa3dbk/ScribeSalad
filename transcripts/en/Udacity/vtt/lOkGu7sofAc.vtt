00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.596
Function addition and subtraction happen all the time. For each of these

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:07.136
examples down here, please tell me whether you'd be more likely to add or

00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:13.514
subtract the functions that involved. First we have calculating profit, or p of

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:20.335
x, for money earned, which is r of x, and money spent, c of x. Second, we have

00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:25.690
calculating change in population, or q of t, from the number of births, b of t

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:32.759
and the number of deaths, d of t. And finally, calculating the total production

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.050
of two factories, f of x, from their individual productions, which we will call

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.569
g of x and h of x.
