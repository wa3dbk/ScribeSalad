00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.430
Doing design you need to be able to represent those designs and a very popular

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.440
way of doing that is with diagrams. This course focused on UML, using UML and

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.230
constructing those diagrams and the purpose of this lesson is to review for

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.380
you some of the different kinds of diagrams that are there. There's lots of

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.010
diagrams, we're not going to be using them all. But I'd like you to be at least

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.310
familiar with what ones are there. So let's step back a little bit in history.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.229
Diagrams have been a popular part of software development from the beginning.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:37.320
I still have a flow chart template that you use for

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.190
writing out the control logic of an algorithm. Over the years,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.690
various sophisticated diagramming techniques have developed. Okay.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.030
Among those are SADT, Jackson Design, Structure Design and so on.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.770
Each with their own particular approach to diagramming. In the 1980s, object

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.356
oriented tech, techniques began to emerge, and with them. Various techniques for

00:01:00.356 --> 00:01:05.010
diagramming [UNKNOWN] solutions. The first one we want to look at is called OMT.
