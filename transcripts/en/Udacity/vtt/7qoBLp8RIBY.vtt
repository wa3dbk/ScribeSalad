You know, on, on Reddit we can get any page in

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.070
JSON, or we can also get it in XML by changing

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.540
our extension. And a lot of webpages have this feature, where

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.160
you can get their content in different formats. Another good example is

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.549
Twitter. If we were to go Twitter and do a search,

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.636
let's look for udacity, we can see all of the tweets about

00:00:16.636 --> 00:00:21.213
udacity. Now, if we want to get a JSON listing of this, I happen to know the

00:00:21.213 --> 00:00:27.290
URL. We can go to search.twitter.com/search.JSONq=udacity.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.140
And now we get a JSON listing of the search result that we

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.400
were just looking at in Twitter. If you're writing web software and you want

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.950
to manipulate another website or get data from another website, you know, it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.790
usually just takes a little bit of poking around to find their APIs. Now

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.770
the way I found this API is I just Googled for Twitter API,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.180
and this was, you know, the documentation for this came up. I'll show you

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.780
that real quick. There's this whole page about you know, twitter search API. One

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.440
of the nice things about when you're building websites is if you have data.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.510
You know, if let's say you have a blog. Making your blog

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.100
so it supports RSS. You know, an XML representation of its content, and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.890
maybe JSON representation of your content, or else other people to build

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.319
software on top of your website, that, that can do equal things. And

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.090
so, many large websites, Wikipedia, Twitter, Reddit, all support this types of

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.700
functionality, and your homework in this class is actually going to be, to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.742
add that functionality to your book that we've been working on. Just something

00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:17.294
to be aware, most users don't really see this side of the Internet,

00:01:17.294 --> 00:01:19.548
right? It's really only other developers get to

00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:21.418
see this APIs and these other formats for

00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:25.150
the content, so it's cool that it's all there and it's good to be aware of it.
