Now, that we have equations for the total number of gallons that Grant will buy,

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:08.785
let's compare the old equation we would have used to calculate how many gallons

00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:13.240
of solution Grant would buy to the new equation that we're going to use. How are

00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:18.035
these two lines related? Are they parallel? Are they perpendicular? Do they have

00:00:18.047 --> 00:00:21.865
different slopes? Do they have the same slope? Do they have different

00:00:21.877 --> 00:00:25.815
g-intercepts, or do they have the same g-intercept? Notice that we have

00:00:25.827 --> 00:00:30.125
g-intercept here instead of a y-intercept, because our variable over here is a g

00:00:30.137 --> 00:00:34.340
instead of a y. This is just different notation. Graphically, it really means

00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:39.980
the same thing as a y-intercept since we would create axes to graph these

00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:45.955
equations, with n as the horizontal axis, and g as the vertical axis.
