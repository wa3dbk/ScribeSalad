00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.418
Well let's figure this out together. In this loop i traverses all rows. In this

00:00:04.418 --> 00:00:07.651
nested loop for each row j traverses all columns and we need to figure out x

00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:14.040
and y. Let's look at our picture. As i goes zero, one, two, three and so on the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.466
y position goes 30, 60, 90 and so on. So the y values are 30 times i. I should

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:24.434
really be using this constant over here so let me fix that up and for the same

00:00:24.434 --> 00:00:30.528
reason the x values of width times j. What are our blue and green? Let's look

00:00:30.528 --> 00:00:36.270
at the picture again as I goes larger of the row index, the blueness increases.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.340
When I add 0 blueness is 0. When i is the maximum value of 15, the blueness is

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:51.540
255. So in general, i is 255 divided by the largest value for i. Notice the -1.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.281
There's 16 rows, numbered 0 to 15. And at the 15th one we want the full value

00:00:57.281 --> 00:01:02.751
of 255. The formula for the greens is exactly analogous. When j is zero, green

00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:11.119
is zero. When j is 15, we have 15 times 255 over 15 or 255. And for values in

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.324
between, the green grows as j does. Again, the point of this example was that

00:01:16.324 --> 00:01:20.670
you need two nested loops to control the rows and the columns.
