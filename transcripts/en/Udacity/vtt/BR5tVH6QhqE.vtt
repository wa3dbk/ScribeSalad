00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.505
Our final answer is 24 divided by x. You've really got the hang of simplifying

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:09.415
for finding this one out. To simplify this expression, we want to factor the

00:00:09.415 --> 00:00:14.024
numerator and denominator. 24 is the greatest common factor for these two terms,

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:18.504
and x is the greatest common factor for these two terms. When we factor, we can

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:24.029
see that we have a 2x plus 1 in our numerator and denominator. So these cancel

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.846
to make 1. So, this crazy original expression turns into 24 divided by x. Pretty

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:32.644
nice.
