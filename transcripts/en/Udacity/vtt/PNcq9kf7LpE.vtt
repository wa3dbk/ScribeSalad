00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
And the correct answer is the first one--any Las Vegas algorithm can be turned into

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.830
a Monte Carlo algorithm and the reason for that is the following--

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.530
In a Las Vegas algorithm, we said that the running time was polynomial with a certain probability

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.470
and that means that we can let the algorithm run a few times, so sometimes it will take

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.790
polynomial running time, sometime it would take exponential running time like this.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.250
So this is suppose to be the running time and let's say in the first time it's also exponential

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.960
and we basically jut watch over the algorithm and as soon as it takes longer than polynomial time

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.560
we stop it, we cut it off, and that would then give us exactly a Monte Carlo algorithm

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.200
because here we said for this approach we demand that when we get the solution

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.740
that solution is suppose to be the best possible one.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.880
So here the algorithm would also produce the best possible solution but we stopped it.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.020
We are stuck with some suboptimal solution or even no solution.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.000
Here the same thing as well, but then we started the next time and it just uses polynomial time

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.700
and then we use that solution and this is exactly

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.820
how a Monte Carlo algorithm would behave as well.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.540
It produces the best solution with a certain probability and in this case here

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.110
this probability is dependent on the running time of the Las Vegas algorithm,

00:01:14.110 --> 99:59:59.000
which sometimes will be polynomial and sometimes will be exponential.
