Congratulations, you've just finished the
first piece of this Udacity course. Now

00:00:04.906 --> 00:00:09.134
that we've talked about a number of new
ideas, let's take a few minutes to

00:00:09.146 --> 00:00:13.978
summerize these topics. We've talked about
classification of numbers, algebraic

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.285
terminoligy, simplification of
expressions, and subsitution. Let's try a

00:00:18.297 --> 00:00:22.595
few problems to review. Let's think back
to our world of numbers. This picture

00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:26.765
might look familiar to you, but notice
that it doesn't have the names of the sets

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:30.703
of numbers we've talked about on it.
Please take a minute to match the letters

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:32.021
with the appropriate sets.
