00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.707
First off, let's look at a typical method call. As you know, all the way on the

00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:11.310
left is the object, on which the method is called. Next comes the name of the

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.740
method. And the values, that we supply to the method, are called the arguments.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.600
That's just a technical term. This particular method call is called with the

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.140
arguments 20 and 0. Let's have a look at another method call, again here is the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.940
object, the method name. This particular method call has no arguments, there's

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.550
just nothing between the two parenthesis. But this method call returns an

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.510
answer, it returns the number of pixels in the picture. That answer, or as we

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.150
say, that return value, is then stored in the variable that you see on the

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.980
left. What about the method call up here? This method call has no return value,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.620
it simply, carries out an action, namely to grow the picture.
