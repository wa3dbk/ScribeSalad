00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.188
Writing up and counting out those 22 n in
the last quiz took me a really long time,

00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:09.110
so I can only imagine how torturous it
would have been if I had, had to multiply

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:14.083
2n by a number bigger than 11. Fortunately
there is a much easier way to simplify

00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:17.926
terms than adding them together like we
did then. To talk about how this works,

00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:25.989
let's start by considering a term. let's
say, 5x times 7y times 2z. Now remember, a term is

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.866
a bunch of variables or numbers, or both,
that are multiplied together. And before

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:33.650
we start playing around with this term,
I'd like to add one more word to our

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.062
vocabulary, factor. Now, factors are
things that we multiply together.

00:00:39.062 --> 00:00:43.750
Just like terms are things that we add
together. So this term, 5x times 7y

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.005
times 2z, is made up of a bunch of factors
that are all multiplied together. Another

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:53.208
way to think of a factor, is that it's
something that a term is divisible by.

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:57.377
Now, we can't forget that in this term
there are invisible multiplication signs

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:02.567
between the five and the x, the seven and
the y, and the two and the z. So another

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:07.836
way to think about this term is that it's
5 times x times 7 times y times 2 times z.
