This lesson covered how to use Tag
Manager to dynamically update your app.

You've learned

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.930
how to download the container
from Tag Manager into your app.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.810
You used built in variables to
figure out the user's language.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.590
You used value collection
variables with triggers

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.260
to determine which daily special to
show based on he user's language.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.440
And you use data layer variables to
transport information back from the app

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.310
to the tag manager container.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.009
In this case to push the user's food
preference into the data layer.
