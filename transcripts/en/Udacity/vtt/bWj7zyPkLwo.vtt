00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.270
While we could solve our problem by calling our draw function with

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.720
setInterval or setTimeout, the better way is to use requestAnimationFrame.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.720
requestAnimationFrame, only sends a request if the last frame is

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.240
already finished drawing, or the window is actively being viewed.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.620
setInterval and setTimeout, execute no matter what.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.420
So if your drawing takes a really long time to finish a single frame, and

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.640
your interval is really small, it can cause your browser to slow down or crash.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.510
So when I add a call to requestAnimationFrame, after this drawImage call here.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.460
It makes sure the canvas gets updated.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.940
So when we hit Play, it should keep it in sync.
