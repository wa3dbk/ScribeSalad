00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer to this question is fairly straightforward.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In data we have 2 possibilities.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The median could either be 9 or it could be 15.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So we'll accept either of those.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In order for it to be unique, we just need to take their average,

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and that's equal to 12.
