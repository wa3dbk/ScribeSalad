00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.710
So, the first requirement clearly refers to some specific functionality of

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.230
the Bowling Alley system, because it talks about what the system has

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.420
to do from a functional standpoint. So, it's definitely not a non-functional

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.400
requirement. On the other hand, the fact that the Word Count system

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.320
should be able to process large files, is telling us something not

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.580
about the functionality of the system, but rather about its qualities. The

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.600
fact that it has to be scalable, that it has to be

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.190
efficient and so we can consider this to be a non-functional requirement.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.010
Similarly, the fact that the Login program for a

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.390
website should be secure is definitely telling us something

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.800
about the quality of the system that has little

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.026
to do with its functionality. And so this is

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:36.680
also a non-functional requirement. Finally, the fact that the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.980
Vending Machine program should take coins as an input

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.010
from the user is telling us something about the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.100
functionality of the program and therefore, is a functional requirement.
