00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.380
Now let's remember, the whole concept of convolution and

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:08.270
gradients, again, recall that convolution is basically taking our,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.800
kernel, involving with the input to get a new image.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.150
So this is [INAUDIBLE] of convolution, we'll now need to ask the question,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.810
what happens if I take this convolution formulation and

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.810
just do a derivative of this in x, of course, we would do it separately for y,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.190
if I was to do a, derivative of this,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.670
basically means that I would have derivative of the convolution.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.300
To help us, let say if D is the kernel to compute the derivatives, and

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.520
H is the kernel for smoothing.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.215
So basically, what we're kind of saying is,

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:42.450
dell of the x could actually become now a operation because we

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.990
have actually represented basically that as a kernel to compute derivatives, and

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.341
H is a kernel, for smoothing, we can rewrite this formulation as, so

00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:57.600
again, if D and H are known, we could basically now define the derivative and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.560
smoothing operation as one formulation, D, convolved with, H convolved with F.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.590
Of course, remembering our understanding of the basic properties of convolution,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.420
we could actually do a derivative of the kernel, and then

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.210
just apply the convolution of the kernel itself directly to the input image.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.010
So we could actually now not just have to do, this process and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.890
then come up with the derivative, I could take any kernel and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.030
keep it in my storage as a new kernel that basically has a derivative itself,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.230
and use that and apply directly to the image.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.390
So this actually becomes an interesting way of looking at things, and

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.130
again, it's widely used in how we do types of image processing,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.940
types of techniques to extract gradients.
