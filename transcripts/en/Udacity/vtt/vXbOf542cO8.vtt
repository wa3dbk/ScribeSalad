00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.940
Let's look at the solution to our RAID
0 quiz where we have an array of four

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.230
disks, and for one disk we know
the capacity, throughput, and MTTF.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.590
In RAID 0, we're striping the data
across all the disks with no redundancy.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.570
So we can use a capacity of all four
disks, and thus get 800 GB in capacity.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.490
If we spread the read and write load
evenly across the disks, then one disk

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.440
being able to support 10 megabytes per
second and four disks being used in

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.486
parallel like this gives us a throughput
of 40 megabytes per second.

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:42.356
And finally, if the MTTF for
one disk is 100,000 hours,

00:00:42.356 --> 00:00:48.660
the expected MTTF for the whole array
is going to be a quarter of this,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.009
if they are in RAID 0, so
we will get 25,000 hours.

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.003
This MTTF ends up being almost 12 years.

00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:00.120
This one is almost three years.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.800
If we plan to replace our array after
something like five or six years,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.170
know that it can still fail
within the five or six years, but

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.980
on average it's going
to last about 12 years.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.820
However, here our average array is going
to fail during the five to six years.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.590
So obviously with such a low MTTF,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.230
we should not have used four
disks in RAID 0 like this.
