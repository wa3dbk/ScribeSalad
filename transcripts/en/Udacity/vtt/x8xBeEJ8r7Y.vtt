Let us do a series of exercises together. This time,

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.550
the concept that the AI agent is going to learn about,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.190

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.720
All right, because there is only one example the only kind of learning that can

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.972
occur here is variabilization. What do you think will be the values that can go

00:00:19.972 --> 00:00:23.520
in these boxes here that will variabalize these four bricks.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.840
