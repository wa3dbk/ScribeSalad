00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.820
The last question is,
what happens when you want to update?

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.750
Say Heartbleed comes out or you got
a new version of your app, what then?

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.260
Obviously, we want to update our
containers to protect our data or

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.700
to get new code out in front of users,
but

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.029
it would be risky to roll
those changes out all at once.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.780
So instead we use queued CTO rollout.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.160
Let's walk through an example.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.320
In this example we're going to be
updating our Pods to a new version.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.780
So we have a service with three
replicated pods, after issuing

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.980
the queued CTO roll out command for
v2 of our app, one comes online.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.820
Then our server starts
routing traffic to it.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.510
So we have both v1 and
v2 getting traffic at the same time.

00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:51.610
Next we stop routing traffic
to one of the old pods, and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.710
then we get rid of it entirely.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.060
At this point the cycle continues, all
the way through till we get our desired

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.540
three replicas back, at which point we
have three versions of app v2 running.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.910
That's pretty cool.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.770
Let's have Kelsey show
us this in practice.
