00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If we apply this higher amount of friction, it's going to take 3.4 seconds to bring the car

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to a complete stop and for the smaller amount of friction, it's 4.9 seconds,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and now let's look at how to compute this.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We have to take two different forces into account.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The force due to friction, biking that is, and the force due to gravity.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Newton says F=m&lt;i&gt;a.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The force due to friction equals the mass of the car

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
times the deceleration as we are breaking off the car.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But the force exerted due to friction is amountable of the force exerted by gravity

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
with the proportionality constant µ and what's force the exerted by gravity?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's the mass of the car times the gravitational acceleration of the earth.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You see that's Newton law applied in the reverse direction.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If you look closely, you'll see that mass cancels from both sides of the equation

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and the deceleration equals the constant of friction times the gravitation acceleration.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This is one funny consequence for astronauts.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
When you try to break a car on the moon, the gravitational acceleration is far less than on earth

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and so the deceleration is far less than on earth.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Breaking is far more ineffective on the moon than on earth.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Now we can use this result to look at how speed depends on time.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The deceleration is constant so the velocity decreases

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
by a certain fixed amount of meters per second.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The relationship between velocity and time is linear

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and the slope of this line is given by the acceleration.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This side has a length of 1, this side has a length of a, the acceleration,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
which is, as we now know, the constant of friction times the gravitational acceleration.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You'll see two similar triangles in here.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We have the time it takes to come to a complete stop divided by the initial velocity

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
equals 1 divided by the deceleration.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The time it takes to come to a complete stop equals 120 km/h divided by our deceleration

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
which is the constant of friction times the gravitational acceleration.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We have to go from kilometers per hour to meters per second.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The gravitation acceleration equals 9.81 m/s² .

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
To make this work, we should be using m/s for the velocity as well.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:39.000
One kilometer is 1000 meters and 1 hour amounts to 3,600 seconds.

00:02:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now you can do the math.
