00:00:00.111 --> 00:00:03.667
This problem could get pretty complicated, so let's write some test cases out.

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:09.963
I'll index spots by row and column. So 2, 2 would be right here, and that spot

00:00:09.963 --> 00:00:17.542
should be blue. So, we need an expression that when given 2 and 2 gets 0. The

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:28.710
spot 3, 3 should also be blue. So again, we need a zero. 2, 3 should be red.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.878
So, that should be a 1. And 3, 2 should be red. So, also 1. So, what's an

00:00:37.878 --> 00:00:42.780
expression I could try to use to turn 2 and 2 into 0, 3 and 3 into 0, 2 and 3

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.332
into 1, and 3 and 2 into 1. It kind of looks like maybe I'm taking the mod of

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:58.555
these and adding that together. So, row mod 2 plus column mod 2. Let's see what

00:00:58.555 --> 00:01:06.820
this gives in each case. 2 mod 2 would be 0. 0 and 0 gives 0, so that's good. 3

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:15.357
mod 2 is 1 and 2 mod 2 is 0, so that gives 1. The same will happen here. This

00:01:15.357 --> 00:01:22.381
one doesn't quite work. 3 mod 2 is 1 and 3 mod 2 is also 1, so I would get 2.

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:26.905
But then maybe if I just mod the whole thing by 2 again, then I would get 0

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:33.270
which is the same. The 2 would turn into 0 and the ones would stay. So, this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.781
expression might work. Let's test it out in BlueJ. First, I'll check my test

00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:45.144
and put some actual values in it. The test cases I came up with were 2, 2; 3,

00:01:45.144 --> 00:01:51.794
3; 2, 3 and 3, 2. For 2, 2 I expected 0, and I expected the same thing for 3,

00:01:51.794 --> 00:02:02.462
3. At 2, 3 I expected 1, so 1, and at 3, 2 I also expected 1. So, my tester

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:06.606
should be good to go. Now, I'll try putting that expression into the actual

00:02:06.606 --> 00:02:13.397
program. In the checker board painter, instead of returning five, I want to

00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:21.424
return row mod 2, plus col mod 2, and then all mod 2. I don't have to put these

00:02:21.424 --> 00:02:26.412
in parentheses because the plus has lower precedence. And let's try it. If I

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:34.312
run the tester, my actual and expected values match up. But could we make this

00:02:34.312 --> 00:02:40.384
any simpler? What if I noticed that adding an even number plus an even number

00:02:40.384 --> 00:02:46.786
gives me another even number. And an odd number plus an odd number gives me

00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:54.670
another even number, but odd plus even or even plus odd both give odd numbers.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.900
Then I can just add row and column, and take the mod 2 right at the end.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.282
Because if they match, their sum is even. And if they don't match, the sum is

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:08.424
odd. So, I'll just get rid of the mod 2 and the mod 2. If I change it in the

00:03:08.424 --> 00:03:14.032
checkerboard painter, erase that and erase that. What will my test say? Is this

00:03:14.032 --> 00:03:21.723
still the same? And if I run the test again, still works. As a bonus question,

00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:26.683
what if instead of returning 0 when they match and 1 when they don't match, I

00:03:26.683 --> 00:03:34.285
wanted to return one when they match and zero when they don't match. How would

00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:39.238
you do that? I won't go over it, but it's something to think about.
