00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.820
Computer system security has assumed enormous importance in the connected world

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.930
that we live in today. Indeed, there are courses offered just on the topic of

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.020
computer system security. And universities, including

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.620
Georgia Tech, offer an entire Master's degree

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.950
program on information security. In this course module our goal is to get

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.660
an introduction to the terminologies in

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.466
computer system security that we should be

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:35.590
familiar with as operating system designers. Using

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.250
a case study we'll also learn Cryptographic

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.820
techniques that can be used as a tool by an operating system designer

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.870
to provide authentication in a distributed manner.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.400
We'll start this module with a discussion

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.000
of the terminologies first articulated by Jerome Solser. You'll be

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.520
amazed at how computer visionaries thought of issues

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.700
with information security, even before computers were connected to one another.
