00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.900
I was blind before, but now I see.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.760
Docker really does make it easy
to deploy and run our containers.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.700
The logical next step is get Docker on
all of my machines, and I'm good to go.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.390
Kelsey, what is there left for
you to teach me at this point?

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.390
&gt;&gt; There you go again, Carter.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.320
This happens every time I tell
someone about containers.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.160
They think that's the end of the story.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.110
To be honest, packaging containers
is like 5% of the problem.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.555
The real issues have to do with
application configuration,

00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:32.515
service discovery,
managing updates and monitoring.

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:34.880
While we can build all those
things on top of Docker,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.810
we're better off leveraging a platform
to manage all that complexity for us.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.882
&gt;&gt; This is where Kubernetes comes in.

00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:44.700
&gt;&gt; Yep, Kubernetes provides a new set
of abstractions that go well beyond

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.740
the bases of container deployments, and
enable you to focus on the big picture.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.840
Previously, our focus has been deploying
applications to individual machines

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.635
which locks you into limited workflows.

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:58.540
Kubernetes allows us to abstract
the way in the individual machines and

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.312
treat the entire cluster like
a single logical machine.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:05.050
The application becomes
a first class citizen which

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.940
enables us to manage them
using high level abstractions.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.070
In Kubernetes, we can describe
a set of applications and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.930
how they should interact
with each other and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.060
then let Kubernetes figure
out how to make that happen.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.300
You're right.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.140
Maybe there's still
a lot I've got to learn.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.544
Let's deep dive into Kubernetes.
