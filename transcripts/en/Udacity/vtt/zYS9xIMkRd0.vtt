So, I really just want to add 4/10 and 3/10. So, here's another kilometer bar,

00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:10.453
and I'm going to fill it with both the 4/10 and the 3/10. This would be 4/10 of

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:15.363
a kilometer and this would be another 3/10 of a kilometer. So, altogether, I

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.216
have 7/10. If you said 7/10, nice work.
