00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Just to recap, trademark protects branding and marks. It gives you the right to prevent

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
others from using confusingly similar marks and logos. It lasts as long as you

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
use the mark. The more you use it, the stronger your protection.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And there are country-by-country laws that define trademark, and it's optional

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to register it, but it has significant advantages if it's approved.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Copyright just gives you the right to prevent others from copying or distributing

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
or making derivatives of your work. And you could copyright more than just technology.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's what we do for songs, books, movies, etc. It lasts practically forever but doesn't

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
prevent independent development. Someone else could do something

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
independently and come up with something quite similar. You could register it.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's optional but is required to sue for infringement, and sometimes you see copyright

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
labeled on the bottom of something with a little c with a circle. That means somebody

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is claiming that this is their original work and suggesting that you need their license

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
or permission to make a copy. Trade secrets as we talked about, you want to keep that

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
a secret, and it has economic value. No registration is required. It's basically

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
how safe do you think your idea is going to be inside your company protected with

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
armed guards and a vault. It can last for as long as you take reasonable steps.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Contracts--again, it's everything that's in the contract, no registration process.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You have whatever protection is defined in the contract.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now patents are interesting. A patent is a government is giving you a monopoly

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
by preventing others from making, using, or selling your invention, even if the other's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
infringement was innocent or accidental. And this has to be a non-obvious invention.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It has to last--the protection lasts for about 15 to 20 years. And there's a whole

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
application and examination process, and it's worth you getting up to date and

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
understanding about patents early on. A very rough rule of thumb is if you're in

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
web 2.0, you probably shouldn't be spending a lot of time on patents,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
though there are exceptions. If you're in life sciences, in the other extreme, you shouldn't

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
leave your bedroom without a patent counsel walking you out. There are some

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
rules of thumb for each industry and each market, and you really need to spend

00:02:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
at least an hour before you start your company understanding what rules apply.
