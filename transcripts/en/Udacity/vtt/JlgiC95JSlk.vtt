And the answer is yes, both of these are functions. They both pass the vertical

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.527
line test, which we know means neither one of them as more than one output, or y

00:00:11.527 --> 00:00:16.946
value, for a given x value. That means that we could also represent these with

00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:21.186
function notation like f of x instead of y. Y is still perfectly acceptable

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:21.593
thought.
