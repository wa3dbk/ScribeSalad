00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.290
Let's begin by looking at the performance issues when using the pipe and

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.700
filter architecture.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.250
On the one hand, the pipe and filter style can enhance throughput

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.230
because the filters can run in parallel, that is, concurrently.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.050
So you're overall system throughput can be reduced.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.694
On the other hand, an individual filter may be slowed down if it,

00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:20.210
if it is waiting for its supplier.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.700
Moreover, if the hardware only allows one process to run at a time.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.710
There maybe significant overhead due to contact switches among the filters.
