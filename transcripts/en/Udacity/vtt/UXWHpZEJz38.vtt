At the conclusion of this lesson, we'll have a short video after the wrap up

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.950
called the cognitive connection. Knowledge based AI is richly connected to

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.660
cognitive signs. And so many of the topics that we'll cover in

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.520
this class are connected to human reasoning and human learning, and

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.910
human memory. The cognitive connections are not separate from the course. One of

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.050
the goals of this course is to learn how to use the design of AI agents to

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.460
reflect on human cognition. The cognitive connections will serve this purpose.
