00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.000
And the key thing to know for

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.060
bag of words is that the word order does not matter.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.720
It's clearly a no, because we are counting words we have no preference to where in

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.160
the phrase a word occurs,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.050
which kind of make it somewhat limited compared to really understanding a text.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.100
It's kind of taking all the words and resorting them in random order.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.860
That's why it's called bag of words.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.265
Because you toss them into a bag.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:24.861
And gone they are.

00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:26.750
Long phrases do give different vectors.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.660
So suppose we take the same email and duplicate it.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.540
All the counts go up by a factor of two, and

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.810
it's going to be a different input vector.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.870
So to some extent you're biasing yourself to also encode the length of your text

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.780
not just the frequency of the words, so the answer would be clearly yes.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.500
And I would say, can we handle complex phrases.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.050
Right now we can't, unless we make extra buckets for

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.820
those, which makes it a bit more difficult to preprocess.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.430
Chicago Bulls would count one for Chicago and one for Bulls.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.760
And here's a funny little insight,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.480
when Google first came out as a search engine and you typed in Chicago Bulls.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.989
You saw lots of, of, of references to cities and lots of references to animals.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.480
And so a, a bunch of smart Google engineers to change the dictionary to also

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.760
included combined phrases like Chicago Bulls.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.490
So go to Google, try it out.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.730
I promise you you see very few animals and very few cities.
