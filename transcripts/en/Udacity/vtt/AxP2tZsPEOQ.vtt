Once you've produced some summary statistics,

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.140
you'll write a brief blog post explaining the results of your analyses from

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.690
assignment three, incorporating the visualization you made for assignment four.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.400
And, also your newly produced map for these findings.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.900
When this is complete, you should have an interesting and informative blog post

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.320
about the New York City subway that you can share with your friends and family.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.210
Writing this blog post will give you some good practice communicating your

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.110
findings to other people, whether they be other data scientists or

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.060
less technical business partners.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.790
This is one of the most important skills a data scientist can

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.650
have when working in the real world, since not everybody's a data expert.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.480
This blog post should also be an excellent first entry in to

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.060
your portfolio of work as a data scientist,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.540
which you can share with other people when they ask what projects you've done.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.040
I've posted an example blog post on the class forum,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.290
in case you need some inspiration.
