00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.681
Now before we move on from confidence intervals, let's generalize it. Which of

00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:09.827
the following formulas represents what you did to find the 95% confidence

00:00:09.827 --> 00:00:15.390
interval for the population mean used to buy? So, you have four options. Check

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.940
all that apply. And up here, just to refresh your memory, we have the

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:27.563
definitions of each of the symbols. And z is this z score value here where 95%

00:00:27.563 --> 00:00:31.133
is in between these two z scores.
