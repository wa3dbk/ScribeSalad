00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.116
In this exercise, you'll start with a program that gives a model like this. Note

00:00:04.116 --> 00:00:07.656
that the x, y, and z axis are shown given as the colors red, green and blue

00:00:07.656 --> 00:00:12.002
respectively. Think of this as a clock hand sort of, it points to 12 and 6

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:16.660
o'clock currently, we'll fix that later. Your task is to rotate the hand of the

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.500
clock so that it points at 2 and 8 o'clock as shown here.
