00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
Taken together, a lot of this design information,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.600
can be thought of as design rationale. Rationale here means,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.040
the reasons that you did what you did in coming up with your design solution.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.890
The more you can make explicit choices with reasons for

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.550
those choices, the better off we'll be, the downstream people who are trying to

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.390
maintain the system. The bottom line as far as design information is concerned,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.050
is that there's many options to you. And you need to decide upfront, what it

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.360
is that's going to be important in your documentation, and then capture it

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.530
as you go along. Now I'd like to introduce you to some key design concepts that

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.740
are going to be used throughout the term, when we talk about software design.
