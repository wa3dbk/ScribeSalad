In the sample code provided you'll notice

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.000
that we create a Http Url connection. To

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.430
use Http to send and receive data over

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.960
the network, we have two clients on Android.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.740
The Http Url connection class, as well as

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.700
the patchy Http Client class. Both options support

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.010
Https, streaming uploads and downloads, configurable time outs,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.460
IPB 6 and connection pooling. We recommend the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.850
Http Url Connection class because it's general purpose and light

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.730
weight, and it's been optimized to suit the needs of

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.460
most Android apps. To learn more about connecting to the

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.130
network, see the training guide and blog post link below.
