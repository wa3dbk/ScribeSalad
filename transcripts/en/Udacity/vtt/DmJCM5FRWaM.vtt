00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.910
So normalized cuts fixes this bias

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.720
that Ncut has of, wanting to
pull off these little elements.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.910
And the way it does it is it's
going to propose a cut, and

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.340
it has the traditional
measure of cutting A and B.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.010
But it's normalized, by the association
within A and the association within B.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.480
And a simple way of thinking about is
the association is just sort of how

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.275
well connected,
summed over all of the nodes within a,

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:34.775
in a segment how well
connected those points are.

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:38.675
So the problem is,
is if you have a two segments, and

00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:41.935
one is very small,
it's going to have a very small value.

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:44.432
And if that denominator
becomes a small value,

00:00:44.432 --> 00:00:46.422
that whole element becomes very large.

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:49.752
So, even though the,
the other element might be a small size,

00:00:49.752 --> 00:00:53.732
the fact that this one became
small will penalize that a lot.

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:58.682
So, by doing a this
normalization you can end up

00:00:58.682 --> 00:01:01.372
with a much better cut of the graph.

00:01:01.372 --> 00:01:02.552
If you just wanted to do,

00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:07.350
the best end cut normalized cut that
would be computationally-prohibitive.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.400
But there's an approximate solution
that exists using what is referred to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.680
as the generalized, or solving
the generalized eigenvalue problem.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.045
I'll just show you a very simple,
not simple,

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:19.740
I'll show you a very high level
description of, of what goes on.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.780
And if you want more details,
you can go and take a look at papers or

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.400
Wikipedia or anything like that.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.760
And so here, here is how it works.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.890
Let's suppose we've got the matrix W,
which is the adjacency matrix.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.980
So W,i,j is just the adjacency
between pixel i and pixel j.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.230
And then, there's a special matrix,
this diagonal matrix,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.860
that is just what's called
the degree of the node.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.050
For every vertex, how many other
vertexes is, are connected to it, right?

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.240
And so in this case, it's the sum, so

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.990
the, the, it's a diagonal matrix,
so the, the degree of pixel i

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.300
is just the sum of all the affinities
i,j summed over all the j.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.540
And then what you can show
is the normalized cut cost,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.560
can be written in using this,
simple expression,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.210
where this vector y is what's
referred to as an indicator vector.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.540
So it's a vector that's
got positive ones and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.820
negative ones as to whether, remember
cutting this into two parts A and B, so

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.150
it's a positive one if that
point belongs to segment A.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.220
And its a negative,
constant otherwise, all right?

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.480
So just to solve even that for
y is very difficult, but,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.230
what you can do instead is,
this is just written out here.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.060
We solve this eigenvector equation,
and what that'll do is it'll solve for

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.228
you for these y's directly.

00:02:45.228 --> 00:02:49.690
But these y's, they're not going to be
binary, you know, minus one or plus one.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.747
They're going to have,
continuous values, and

00:02:52.747 --> 00:02:58.110
what you then do is you use that vector
in order to solve for, the partitioning.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.905
And this is related to,
spectral partitioning, for

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:04.897
those of you who are familiar with those
algorithms, and it's just a, an ei,

00:03:04.897 --> 00:03:08.606
an eigenvalue way of approximating
the solution to this partitioning,

00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:12.280
because the full solution would
computationally too difficult.
