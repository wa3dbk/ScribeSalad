00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.590
So let's look at what the Harris
Detector algorithm looks like in

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.641
each and every step.

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:07.955
So, first step, we want to do for
Harris Corner Detection is compute

00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:10.654
the horizontal and
vertical derivatives of the image.

00:00:10.654 --> 00:00:14.616
And, again, if you recall, we have
learned how to do this in an earlier

00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:18.250
lecture by using, basically,
how to compute derivatives, and

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.190
also doing to get towards computations
towards things like gradient images.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.518
And another thing we want to do is we
want to actually now compute information

00:00:27.518 --> 00:00:29.421
from the gradients to compute M.

00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:32.648
Then, we, actually, kind of want
to smooth it out a little bit, and

00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:34.820
that's why we take a larger
Gaussian image and

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.492
take this image that we get and
smooth it out a little bit,

00:00:37.492 --> 00:00:40.750
because we want to kind of get more
information out of the signal here.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.508
Then, we actually start measuring
scalar interest measure.

00:00:44.508 --> 00:00:47.873
And I encourage you to look at more
details on where are the books that

00:00:47.873 --> 00:00:52.330
could be available and the material
that are make available on this one.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.008
And then, we want to basically find
maximum value above some threshold, and

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:57.432
those would be the features.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:00.253
So, this is a step by step
method on how we can actually do

00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:01.641
Harris Corner Detection.

00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:03.280
Let's look at more details on this one.
