Now, if you've been around software engineering long enough, you'll realize that

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:08.777
most of the technology that makes up the web isn't really new or cutting edge.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:13.203
It's actually old technologies with new, sometimes worse names. Now, I think

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:17.618
Atlases and spreadsheets are a perfect point of this. So a spreadsheets in the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.069
HTML5 world actually describes that what we use an Atlas. But this is very, very

00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:26.735
wrong. See back in the 2D days of making games. Atlases were used to define many

00:00:26.747 --> 00:00:31.360
sorts of charts in a single image, where spreadsheets was a term reserved just

00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:35.845
for animated objects. The spreadsheet concept only really existed when you

00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:40.250
needed particles to fly around or a character to make a swipe with his sword,

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:45.055
everything else was just an Atlas. Now, for you web developers out there who are

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:49.875
actually using the term spreadsheet incorrectly, I forgive you. But let's try to

00:00:49.887 --> 00:00:50.755
fix that, okay?
