00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's a new quiz. The Great Grammar Fix-Up.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's a puzzle in which I've written a partial context-free grammar on the left with five holes,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and over here on the right, I have five strings that I want to be in the language of the grammar.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What I'd like you to do is fill in each hole with the single word

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
like s, a, b, c, d lower case letter, that sort of thing, so that this grammar accepts these five strings.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now, the real challenge here is this partial structure that I've provided.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If I covered this up and said you could write anything you want, it'd be pretty easy,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but instead, you have to use this context that I've already given you and that's the challenge.

00:00:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The hint is that the naming is sometimes handy, but sometimes, it leads you astray. Be careful.
