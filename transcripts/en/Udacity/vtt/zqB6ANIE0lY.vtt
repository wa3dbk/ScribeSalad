00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.191
The degrees of freedom for between group variability is k minus 1. If we add

00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:09.768
this to the degrees of freedom for within group variability. And then we do a

00:00:09.768 --> 00:00:14.374
little bit of switching around. We get that the k's cancel each other out. And

00:00:14.374 --> 00:00:20.000
we're left with n minus 1. This is our total degrees of freedom. You learned

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.649
before that the degrees of freedom is the sample size minus one. Well, this is

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:29.010
the total number of values in all the samples. And we subtract 1 to get the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.100
total degrees of freedom.
