00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.140
Most any time that you use a computer,

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.760
you're going to interact with a file system.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.010
Here you see me navigating the file

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.570
system on my computer to find this presentation.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.110
There it is.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.170
I started off at my Home folder, inside of there I

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.060
went to Pictures. And then the filesystems, and there I found

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.400
this image that I was looking for. This is really convenient.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.610
In my case, the data I was looking for was on

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.270
the hard disk of my local machine. But I didn't have

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.550
to remember physically where the data was, i.e., the platter, the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.460
track, the sector number, et cetera. Instead, I was able to

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.830
access the data through a very intuitive interface provided by a file

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.850
system module of the operating system. There are at least

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.580
three key abstractions at work here. The first is the notion

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.000
of the file itself. In reality, the data may not

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.300
be placed next to each other on a disk orl in

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.170
the right order. But an application developer, the author of

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.100
the sketchbook program I'm using for instance, gets to create the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.410
data of a file as one big, long contiguous string of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.830
bytes. Second is the filename. I don't have to remember any

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.040
of the physical information about how my file is

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.500
stored, the sector number where it starts, for instance. Instead,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.700
I get to assign my file an intuitive name, in

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.500
my case, Image001.tif. Third is the notion of folders, or

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.600
directories, as we will call them. These are containers for

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.060
other files or directories that help keep things organized. The

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.550
idea is that we have an electronic version of what

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.890
was once the more common physical filing system. We put

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.690
folders withing folders to help us keep things organized. So

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.540
in this machine then, I don't just have a pictures

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.800
folder but also a documents folder. And within there I

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.340
have a folder for advanced operating systems. And maybe there's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.150
another one for software development process, etc. And even this

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.120
home directory sits inside a larger directory for all users,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.960
which then sits inside of a directory called root. Which

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.780
then contains folders for the operating systems and other things.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.520
This directory is called the root because if we

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.720
think of this directory structure as an upside down tree,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.830
then this all encompassing directory would be the root or

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.360
the base of the tree. Indeed, the structure will always

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.610
be a tree, just by the nature of directories

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.280
or the nature of physical file folders for that matter.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.420
We call the directory immediately above another directory its parent.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.330
File systems, for instancce, is the parent directory of image001.tif.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.410
Pictures is the parent director of File Systems,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.180
et cetera. Together, these three abstractions provide a

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.870
convenient and almost universal interface for storing and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.760
retrieving data from mass storage. In this lecture,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.060
we'll talk about how this interface is implemented

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.510
and some of the common optimizations. We'll focus

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.210
on the disk medium, but many of the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.500
ideas we discuss apply to other media as well.
