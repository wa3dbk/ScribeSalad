00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.340
So there's lots of different ways you could have solved

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.880
this. You need to use the print command to print out

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.990
the result. And then we want an expression that calculates the

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.590
number of minutes in seven weeks. There's seven weeks, each week

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.930
has seven days, so we can have seven times seven for

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.910
the number of days. Then to get the number of minutes,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.850
we need to multiply that by 24 to get the number

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.460
of hours And then multiply again, by 60. That should give

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.770
us the number of minutes. So let's see that in the Python interpreter. And now

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.704
we hit Run, and we see that we have 70,560 minutes. Seems

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:40.490
like a lot of time. It's going to go pretty quick, and we hope by

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.150
the end of the seven weeks, all of you will be accomplished Python programmers.
