00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.140
Welcome to the graduate course on computer networking.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.760
The primary goal of this course is to

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.050
provide a survey of the necessary tools, techniques,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.170
and concepts to perform research in computer communications. This

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.280
is a project based course, and there will

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.800
be significant emphasis on hands-on experience. In networking, perhaps

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.880
more than many other subjects, realization is key.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.230
You can read about concepts or techniques in a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.440
textbook, but really the most effective way to learn

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.160
networking is by doing. So, you'll gain a lot

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.060
of hands on experience in this course. Through the

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.970
assignments. In comparison to an introductory networking course, which

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.340
you may have taken, this course will provide more

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.820
in depth coverage of networking topics. And, it will

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.190
also offer a crash course in some of the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.300
available tools that are now available for performing research in

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.780
computer networking. You will gain experience, with many of

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.580
these tools, through the project based assignments in the course.
