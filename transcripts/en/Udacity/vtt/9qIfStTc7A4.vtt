00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.270
So once we see these two things next to each other, it

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.635
kind of raises the question, why, don't we just use a gradient decent type

00:00:05.635 --> 00:00:09.930
,on an error metric that's defined in terms of y, hat instead of

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.730
this, the activation a? because y hat ,is the thing, that we really

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.230
want to match the output. We don't really want the activation to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.470
match the output. There's no, there's no need for that. So, it seemed

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.730
there's a, bunch of different possible reasons for that. It could be, well

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.990
we don't do that, because, it

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.640
would just be computationally compactable. It's too,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.410
it's too much work. Another possibility ,would be, well to

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.340
do the gradient descent, you'd have to be able to take

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.980
the derivitive and if we use it in this form,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.370
it's not differentiable. So, we can't take the derivative. Another one

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.710
is, well sure we can do all that, it's not

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.800
intractable and its not, not differentiable. But, if we do that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.960
then the weights tend to grow too fast, until you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.970
end up getting unstable answers, and then, the last possible choice

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.410
that we will give you is. You can do

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.740
that but you can get multiple different answers and

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.130
the different answers, behave differently and so this is

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.390
really just to keep it from being in illdefined.
