00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.590
If you're displaying dynamic content
where you don't know the exact size it

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.510
will be or
when handling different size devices,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.560
it can be useful to display
the image at a fixed aspect ratio.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.500
So you know how your design
will appear for your users.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.380
We've already covered using
scale type such as center crop,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.880
to make the content fit
within an image view.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.480
But how do we enforce
the size of the view itself?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.290
To do this, we can easily subclass image
view to enforce a given aspect ratio.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.807
Let's walk through an example of always
wanting our images to show with a 3:2

00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:33.090
aspect ratio.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.190
That is whatever width its given,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.020
will set its own height
to be two-thirds of this.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.420
Let's create a new class and
we're calling it 3:2 image view here.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.330
And will extend from ImageView itself.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.140
Now, we'll generate all of
the required constructors to

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.040
handle create this view from code or
from XML.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.930
Now the key part,
let's override the onMeasure method.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.380
We'll unpack the width we're given,
and then calculate two-thirds of this.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.530
As the threeTwoHeight.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.080
We'll then say that our view's
height wants to be exactly

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.400
that two-thirds of the width height.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.310
We then pass these onto
the superclass to handle the rest

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.630
of the measurement class.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.070
To use our custom class, we use our
fully qualified name in the tag and

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.160
follow the convention
setting 0dp as the height.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.533
As this declared value isn't used,
but has to be provided.

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:30.840
And the view itself will then calculate
height later on when it measures itself.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.550
This is similar to how we used weights
in lesson one to fill the space in

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.030
a linear layout.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.610
We set 0dp as the unused size because
the weight would fill it in later.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.940
We'll go into much more detail
on altering your lay out for

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.990
different size devices in lesson five.
