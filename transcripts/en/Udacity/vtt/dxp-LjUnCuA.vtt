00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.166
At the end of our last lesson, I showed you an example of how to start with the

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.588
equation for a parabola in standard form and then work through modifying it, so

00:00:08.588 --> 00:00:12.932
that it's in the form that we can just read off the coordinates of the vertex.

00:00:12.932 --> 00:00:17.161
Now you're going to get a chance to find this. But don't worry. I'll help you

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:21.560
through it. Let's say we're dealing with the equation, y eqiuals x squared minus

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.070
8x plus 15. Remember our goal here is to get this in the form y minus k equals

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.637
the quantity x minus h squared. So the first thing that I notice about this form

00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:34.775
over here that we're aiming for is that we have y minus a constant. So one

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:39.191
logical first step would be to get the constant that's on the right side, to be

00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:43.555
over on the left side instead. So the first thing I'd like you to do then is to

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:48.210
make that change, getting the constant term to be on the left hand side instead.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.357
And rewrite the equation in this box.
