00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.173
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We saw earlier that we can rate the standard form for the equation of a

00:00:04.173 --> 00:00:08.784
parabola as y equals Ax squared plus Bx plus C. So the equation that produces

00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:13.443
any parabola should be able to be written in this form. And recently what we've

00:00:13.443 --> 00:00:17.835
been doing is taking equations that are written in this standard form and

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:22.646
replacing y over here with 0. So in general that gives us something like this.

00:00:22.646 --> 00:00:27.182
Now we know that this is no longer an equation for a parabola. This is not going

00:00:27.182 --> 00:00:31.739
to give us any points to graph since we only have x as our single variable. This

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.080
value of 0 isn't varying, so it's not a variable. It's just a constant. This

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.544
kind of equation, or an equation that you can write in this form, is called a

00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:45.294
quadratic equation. Now a quadratic equation has one of the same restrictions

00:00:45.294 --> 00:00:50.221
that the standard form for the equation of parabola did. This coefficient A here

00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:54.561
is not allowed to equal 0. What I would like you to tell me now is what the

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:59.392
degree of a quadratic equation is. Think back to what you learned about the term

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:02.459
degree way back the very beginning of the course.
