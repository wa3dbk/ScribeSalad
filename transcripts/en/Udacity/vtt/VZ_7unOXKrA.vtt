00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.870
Before we get started, let's discuss
some of the necessary technologies you

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.020
should be familiar with in order to
get the most out of this course.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.910
Most importantly, you should have
a basic understanding of Python coding.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.050
If you're comfortable creating classes,
writing methods, and

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.930
understand inheritance,
you are in good shape for this course.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.310
Knowledge of SQL statements such as
insert into, select, update, and

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.680
delete will also be a useful
skill in this course.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.460
I will also assume you're
very comfortable reading and

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.050
writing HTML code.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.880
CSS and JavaScript won't be necessary
to complete the activities, but

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.210
are helpful for creating a polished,
presentable final project.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.320
Knowing your way around
the Unix command line and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.940
being able to navigate through the file
system is also going to come in handy.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.110
If you are unfamiliar or would like
to brush up on any of these topics,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.330
please refer to the instructor notes for
some helpful links to classes and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.640
other references.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.030
For ease of configuration, and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.120
installation, I strongly recommend using
a Vagrant machine for this course.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.230
Vagrant allows you to create a virtual
machine on your computer so that you can

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.750
program without worrying about affecting
your computer's current configuration.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.280
I have provided you a Vagrant file
with all of the necessary software

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.489
already installed.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.990
A link to installing this Vagrant file
is provided in the instructor notes.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.940
Once you successfully run vagrant up and
vagrant ssh, you're ready to keep going.
