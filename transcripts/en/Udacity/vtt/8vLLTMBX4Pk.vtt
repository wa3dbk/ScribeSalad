00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.860
If your app let's people buy things,
it must also let them ask for a refund.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.840
Your app has to have the code for
processing refunds.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.930
Sending a refund hit to analytics
does not execute the refund.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.030
It simply reports it.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.640
You can read about sending refund
hits in the developer guide.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.600
You can report either a partial or
a full refund.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.360
When you send the hit for a refund,
you must provide a transaction ID.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.000
See here it says in the Developer Guide,
the matching transaction is not found,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.490
the refund will not be processed.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.510
Your app must keep track of
the transaction IDs for itself.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.470
Analytics isn't going to do that for
you.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.000
So it's important to note that Analytics
has a six month limit for refunds.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.740
So that doesn't mean that your app can't
issue refunds after six months, but

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.430
refund hits to analytics won't take

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.430
affect after six months of
the original transaction.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.470
If you're up for the challenge, go ahead
and add a refund button to your app.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.349
I leave it to you to do.
