00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.620
So just to recap, our circles, while we bound them and

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.170
they were on the page, they had no x or y position, radius, or fill color.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.390
So what this chunk of code basically says in English is, for

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.110
each data point or circle, change its x position, according to its date and

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.860
its y position according to its attendance.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.100
Add an attribute of radius.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.920
In this case it's a radius of three as we said previously.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.420
And fill it with a color.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.060
In this case blue.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.180
Before I move on I just wanted to make one more point

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.400
about the anonymous accessor functions.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.870
I'll go over rather a different way of looking at them.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.430
While you can think of these as any other function it takes some input

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.870
in this case D which corresponds to an individual row from our data and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.190
gives some output, in this case, for

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.460
the exposition of pixel value returned from the time scale.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.160
I often like to think of the accessor functions as analogous to the properties

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.540
of a class, for folks who are comfortable with object-oriented programming, or

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.980
in a more simple sense, simply a variable.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.610
In this case, the accessor function for setting the exposition returns

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.660
a variable value depending on what data point gets passed into it.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.500
So again while you can put some logic to transform your data or

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.830
perform some other actions inside of the accessor function,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.340
typically I only use in the sense of pulling out some data.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.650
And returning some value, that's dependent on that value I pulled out.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.440
So in most of the uses of this anonymous accessor functions in D3,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.840
it's often useful to think of them as some data dependent value.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.160
Based on what the bound data is,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.780
the accessor function should return some value derived from the data.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.000
And again this allows us to customize each function for each data point.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.148
In this case for datum one placed at the x position of datum one's date.

00:02:09.148 --> 00:02:15.230
For datum two placed at the exposition of datum two's date and so forth all

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.180
the way to datam 836 or however many pieces of data you have in your data set.
