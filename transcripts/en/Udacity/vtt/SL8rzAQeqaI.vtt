00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.860
Using Android Auto is easy.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.570
Users go to the Play Store and

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.510
download apps onto their phone
that support Android Auto.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.440
They then connect their phone to their
car, the phone goes in the car mode, and

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.290
casts the Android Auto
experience to the car's screen.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.990
This means that although all the apps
and services are actually running on

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.000
the phone, they're displayed in the
car's dash and you interact with them

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.500
using the vehicle's controls such as
a built-in touch screen and microphone.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.130
Now because of this,
you don't need to write a new app.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.060
Instead, you can just extend
your existing Android apps

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.750
to work in the car.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.740
Now there are two great use cases for
this today: audio and messaging.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.200
Audio apps such as music,
radio, and audiobook players,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.070
which are awesome way to stay
entertained while you're driving,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.380
can now be extended into the car.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.810
The APIs are available to expose
content, receive playback control, and

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.600
customize the UI.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.490
Messaging applications,
which are a great way to stay connected

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.820
while you're driving,
can now be extended to the car as well.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.600
APIs are available to
show notifications,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.860
play back the message, and
even reply with speech.
