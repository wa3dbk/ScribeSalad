00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.960
The first factor we see is just X, which is associated with a 0, X equals 0.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.141
There's only one of them so I write a 1 in this box. The other two 0's find are

00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:15.770
at X equals 1 and X equals 2. Each of the factors associated with these appears

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.400
twice in the equation. If we add these numbers up we see that there are five

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.478
0's total, referenced by the factors in this equation. And as you might have

00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:29.574
expected, the total number of zeros we have 5 is equal to the number of factors

00:00:29.574 --> 00:00:33.478
or rather linear factors we see in the polynomial, and is also equal to the

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:40.540
degree of this polynomial function. Once again we see that the linear factors

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.653
zeros, in the degree of a polynomial function, are all very closely connected.
