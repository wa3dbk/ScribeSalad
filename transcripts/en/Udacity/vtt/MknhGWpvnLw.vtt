00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Looking at that, there's a few extra things you need to know about splay trees, and the first is that

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
it's a self-balancing tree which means that if you insert nodes in sort of order, remember we

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
have a binary search tree but we call this stability tree that looks something like this.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And so as you can see, this is a very bad kind of a binary search tree because here to do a lookup,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we're going to have to walk all of the nodes in a tree and we'd lost this nice logarithmic property

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that made lookups and search and deletes extremely fast.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The way a self-balancing binary search tree works is as you add elements to the tree

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that has some sort of a balancing procedure that keeps the thing approximately balanced

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
so that tree operations remain very fast.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And if you look at the literature, it turns out there are tons and tons of different data structures

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that offer self-balancing binary search trees and the fast ones of these end up being somewhat

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
complicated and the splay tree is really one of the simplest examples of a self-balancing 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
binary search tree and the implementation that we're going to look at

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
in the minute contains something like a 100 lines of code.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So the other thing you need to know about splay tree before you get into the code

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is that it has a really cool property that when we access the nodes, let's say we do a lookup

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of this node here which contains 7, what's going to happen is as a side-effect of the lookup

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that node is going to get migrated up to the root and then whatever was previously at the root

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is going to be pushed down and possibly some sort of a balancing operation is going to happen.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But the point is, is that frequently accessed elements end up being pushed towards the root

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
of a tree and therefore, future accesses to these elements become even faster.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So this is sort of a really nifty feature of the splay tree.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So what we're going to do now is look at an open source of Pythons splay tree, specifically a 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
random-based structure that I found on the web and that happens to implement a 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
splay tree--it comes with its own test suite and we're going to look at what kind of code

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
coverage that this test suite gets on the splay tree.
