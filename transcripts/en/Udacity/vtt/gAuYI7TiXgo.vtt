00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.050
Welcome back. As we mentioned at the conclusion of the previous lesson module,

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.460
the drive for extensibility in operating system services led to innovations in

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.650
the internal structure of operating systems

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.810
and dynamic loading of operating system

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.740
modules in modern operating systems. And do not stop there. In this lesson,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.700
we will see how the concept of virtualization has taken the vision

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.270
of extensibility to a whole new

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.690
level. Namely, allowing the simultaneous co-existence of

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.220
entire operating systems on top of the same hardware platform. Strap your

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.800
seatbelts and get ready for an exciting ride. Before we look deep into

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.610
the nuts and bolts of virtualization, let's cover some basics.
