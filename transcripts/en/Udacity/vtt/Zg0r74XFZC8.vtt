00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
Just as a reminder, what the teams will be starting with in Week 1

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.790
is filling out the business model canvas and getting out of the building

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.070
and testing their hypotheses about the value proposition, customer segments, and channel.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.250
In the next week they'll be testing customer relationships,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.550
revenue streams, and partners.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.300
And then in Week 3 they'll be looking at key resources, key activities, and cost structure.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.040
The thing to remember: that the goal is not to draw on the canvas.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.180
The goal is to get out of the building and use the canvas as a scorecard

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.260
for the customer development activities that are going on in the Z axis

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.460
and depth between each one of those canvas scorecards.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.820
You need to make sure your team is learning about who are those right customers,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.760
what are the right value propositions, what is the right revenue model.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.950
And it's the activity that they're doing outside the classroom.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.660
Now, the real winners in this program are not just the teams who get out

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.830
and talk to lots of customers but those who actually turn the data into insight--

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.360
that is, who see patterns, who realize, "Oh, it's not that 43 people liked it,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.220
"it's the 4 people who threw us out but said they would have paid a lot of money."

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.530
"Maybe the business is over there."

00:01:16.530 --> 99:59:59.000
That's what you as mentors and you as facilitators are actually helping these teams see.
