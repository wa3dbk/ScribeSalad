00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.220
A graphical version of the decision table is called a decision tree.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.350
It's a form of a flow chart in which the decisions are taken sequentially and

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.340
the resulting output can be seen as a path through the tree.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.550
It's exactly the same information as in the decision tree, but

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.730
you're seeing it in a different form.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.830
In the decision tree we'll see in just a second, there are two kinds of nodes.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.330
Diamonds denote decisions and rectangles denote the actions that are going to be

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.250
taken based upon the decisions that are made.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.900
The arcs in the diagram indicate the implications when a decision is

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.469
answered in a particular way, either affirmatively or negatively.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.500
Note that in the decision tree you're about to see,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.030
some of the nodes have been duplicated.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:55.740
This is a side effect of the redundancy which occurs in the table as well.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.580
Here's the tree for the previous situation.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.269
On the left is the decision about the master control and

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.760
the on, on the rightmost is the resultant

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.920
response from the system in terms of what lights are on and what lights are off.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.480
Once again, same information is in the decision table.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.600
Note that the two rightmost diamonds contain exactly the same question.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.250
And that's it for combinatorial combinatorial logic.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.640
As you can well imagine, as the number of possibilities for

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.470
the input goes up, these tables quickly become unmanage, unmanageable.
