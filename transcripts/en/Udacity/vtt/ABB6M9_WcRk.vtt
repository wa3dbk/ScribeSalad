00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.739
The answer is graph C, this light green one right here. We found out in the last

00:00:04.739 --> 00:00:09.420
quiz that the vertex of this equation is at negative 1, negative 13. So if you

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.230
look for the curve on this graph that has that vertex, we have two actually that

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.022
meet right here, C and D. If we plug in other points to this equation though, we

00:00:19.022 --> 00:00:21.128
can see that C is the one that fits.
