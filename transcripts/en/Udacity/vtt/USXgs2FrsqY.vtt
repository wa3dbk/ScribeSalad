00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.600
It's true that you could use a normal resolution

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.320
image in the source and then replace it with javascript

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.500
with a higher resolution image. when you programtically detect

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.660
the device pixel ratios greater than one. However ,this means

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.230
that you would be downloading the normal image and

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.990
then a high density image ,on all high density devices.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.590
And unfortunately, most of the current high density devices, that

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.580
is where device pixel ratio is set higher to one,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.065
our mobile devices, like my phone and my tablet

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:31.460
,where bandwidth is probably at a premium. So ,this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.120
isn't really a good solution for any reason except

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.160
simplicity. It is possible though, that this will be

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.760
solved on a server side .For the device pixel

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.260
ratio scenario particularly, by something called client-hints. Client-hints is

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.430
a header sent to the sever to let it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.090
know what device pixel ratio you're rendering at and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.140
what size you're actually looking for. It uses the vary header to let it know

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.550
that the version shouldn't be reused by caches

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.150
improperly. However, client hiddence isn't broadly implemented and

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.190
deployed yet. And, this approach won't necessarily

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.120
solve everything about responsive images. However, once this

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.800
approach is actually implemented broadly, it will definitely

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.250
be a great tool for fixing density issues.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.300
For now though, you need to make the

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.980
decisions on the client side and ask the server

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.900
for the right image for your device pixel

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.800
ratio. Except remember, its not just device pixel ratio.
