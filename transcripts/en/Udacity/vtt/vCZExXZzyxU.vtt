00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.686
Our solution then is to find the factors of 2 and negative 13, so that we can

00:00:03.686 --> 00:00:08.622
eventually use the rational zero theorem. So, what are the positive factors of

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:11.954
2, and what are the positive factors of negative 13?
