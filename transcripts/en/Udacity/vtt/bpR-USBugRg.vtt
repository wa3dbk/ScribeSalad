00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is 0.27.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We first consider the possibility we have actually have cancer, in which our tests

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
will give us a positive result of 0.9 chance, and then we add the possibility of not having cancer

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that's 1-0.1 or 0.9, and then when one gives us a positive result with 0.2 chance or 1-0.8.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Resolving this gives us something like this that is 0.09+0.18 adds up to 0.27.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So now, I want you to write the computer code that accepts arbitrary P₀, P₁, P₂

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and calculates the resulting probability of a positive test result and here's my answer.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
My code does exactly what I have shown you before.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It first considers the possibility of cancer multiply this with the test sensitivity P₁ and then it absorbs

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the opposite possibility, and of course, the specificity over here refers to a negative test results,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so we take 1 minus that to get the +1.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Adding these two parts up give us the desired results so let's try this.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Here's my function f with the prime that we just assumed, and if I hit, run I get 0.27.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Obviously, I can change the prime with this.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So suppose we make it much less likely to have cancer in the prior from 0.1 to 0.01

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
then my 0.27 changes to 0.207.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now realize it is not the posterior in Bayes' rule. This is just the probability of getting a positive test result.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You can see this if you change the prior probability of cancer to zero,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which means we don't have cancer no matter what the test result says,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
but there's 0.2 chance of getting a positive test result,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and the reason is our test has a specificity of 0.8 that is even in the absence of cancer,

00:01:52.000 --> 99:59:59.000
there's 0.2 chance of getting a positive test result.
