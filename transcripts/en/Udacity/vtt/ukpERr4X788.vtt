00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.469
It's possible to get unlucky using direct mapped caches, in

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.170
that different blocks that are important to your application might get

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.230
mapped to the same index in the cache. For instance,

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.190
if an application happens to access two cache lines that have

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.820
the same index, maybe this one and this one here,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.230
then they will constantly be evicting each other from the cache.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.930
And it, it will be essentially useless. This, of course, is

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.540
rather silly given that there are all these other entries in

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.060
the cache that aren't getting used at all. The

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.770
fundamental problem is that the address, any one of these

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.320
here, is only associated with one location in the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.960
cache. We can mitigate these effects by associating an address

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.420
with more than one block in the cache. One

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.400
strategy is to treat all the red lines as blue

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.280
ones, and all of the orange lines as green ones.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.860
If we do this then we'll have twice as many

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.900
places in the cache to store a blue line of memory.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.470
Actually, it's more convenient to think about the blue lines in

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.140
the cache being together. And in this way, we can say

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.950
that we have simply decided to ignore the most significant bit of

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.160
our previous index, but to allow a cache block to now

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.140
be stored in two possible places. Hence, this would be called a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.070
two way associative cache. The downside is that we have to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.560
check two tags now to see if we have a cache hit.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.680
But we are less likely run into a problem, where

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.513
we are constantly evicting the memory we need from the cache.

00:01:21.513 --> 00:01:24.033
If we decide this isn't good enough, we can halve the

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:27.690
number of indices again to create a four way associative cache.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.440
Returning to our general notation, we now say that we have

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.220
2 to the j associativity. This means that we only have

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.520
two to the k minus j indices into our cache, and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.600
the index is really only k minus j bits long now.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.860
This greater associativity also gives the cache

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.890
some choice about replacement. Whereas with the

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.230
direct mount cache, there was only one block in the cache where the data could

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.170
be stored. We now have a set of possible locations. Just two in our example

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.320
but maybe more. Typically, we choose to

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.160
evict the entry that was least recently used.
