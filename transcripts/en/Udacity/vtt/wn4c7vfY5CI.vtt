00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.242
The answer is is that this displacement happens at the vertex shader. This

00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:07.270
shader has control of what happens to each incoming vertex. The vertex shader

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.609
reads the displacement map texture at the vertices' location and uses it to

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:15.005
displace the vertex. The other parts of the pipeline take these displaced

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:19.696
triangles and process fragments created by them. Each fragment has a pixel

00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:23.530
location and cannot change to another pixel location. The fragment shader can

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.995
apply the normal map, but this operation does not change the location of the

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:28.430
vertex.
