00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.490
So let's talk about some
differences in perspective.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.540
Developers write code.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.740
They are responsible for
implementing feature requests,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.690
fixing bugs, and so on.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.960
Their incentives tend to
be more feature oriented.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.630
They want to have big
launches as accomplishments.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.670
Building new features might be dependent
on exploring new technologies or

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.530
approaches that have
not been used before.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.280
Taking new risks.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.660
Operations people run services.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.780
They might take care of
physical servers, or

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.920
run services on hosted infrastructure.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.180
They do deployment upkeep and
trouble shooting.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.900
Their incentives tend to
be more stability oriented.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.800
Anything that requires new untested
technologies or introduces new features

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.150
is a potential problem for the stability
and performance of the system.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.950
The work Ops does is also usually
invisible to the company.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.000
Ops is noticed when something does not
work, not when everything works fine.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.350
The new release that developers get
praise for might cause problems in

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.660
production, and it's Ops that gets paged
if the app is unavailable to the user.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.040
While both of these
perspectives are valid,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.370
sometimes they seem like opposite
in conflicting interests.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.090
Dev can feel like ops is blocking their
work by not providing resources fast

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.050
enough or not being supportive
of new cutting edge tech.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.110
And Ops can feel like Devs are being
irresponsible and reckless and

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.650
just implement new features without
thinking about performance and security.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.160
And there are other players in the
field, as well, like product management.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.370
Product managers may be even
more feature oriented than devs.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.080
They may make external promises, and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.420
they might not ever talk with
traditional operations staff.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.140
If the organization has a security team,
they may be even more change-overse than

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.230
ops, in the fear of introducing new,
unknown vulnerabilities.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.819
Or, on the other hand, they may be more
willing to risk service down-time,

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.400
in order to patch nearly discovered
vulnerabilities quickly.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.150
And then there's business management,
responsible for budgeting and

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.820
buying resources.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.190
Ops may have to requisition
additional resources from them and

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.190
reason why they need those resources,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.760
even if the underlying problem might
be performance of the new release.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.830
So how can you get all of these involve
parties to understand each other's

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.210
different perspective and
work toward shared goals.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.690
After all, the server that's offline
doesn't have any features and

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.670
that's bad for everybody.
