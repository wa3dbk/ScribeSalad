00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.920
The second core service of course is CPU scheduling. And

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.150
exokernel in order to facilitate this core service, maintains

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.714
a linear vector of time slots. So, time is divided into these

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:20.710
epochs T1, T2, T3 and so on, and every time quantum has a begin and an

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.940
end. And these time quantums represent the time

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.660
that is allocated to the library operating systems

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.770
that live on top of exokernel. And the

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.260
time quantum is bound by the begin end

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.760
markers for each library operating system. Each library operating

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.895
system gets to mark its time quantum at

00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:46.430
startup in this linear vector of time slots.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.470
So, for instance, OS1 may say that I get this time slot, I get this time slot,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.390
maybe some of the time slot and so on.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.430
And similarly, OS2 marks its spots in the linear

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.490
vector time slots. So CPU scheduling in exokernel is

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.950
essentially looking at this linear vector of time slots and

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.970
asking the question, in this time quantum, which is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.630
the library operating system that should be running on the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.690
processor? And there is a start time for the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.220
time quantum. There's an end time for the time quantum.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.930
And Let's say, OS1 is now running on the CPU. When the timer interrupt goes

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.210
off, at this endpoint, control is transferred

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.440
by exokernal to the library operating system to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.460
do any saving that it has to do of the context. And the time that is

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.750
allowed for a library operating system to do the saving and restoring of context

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.960
at the point of a context switch is

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.790
bounded. And if an operating system misbehaves, let's say

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.670
that OS1, when exokernel says it's time for you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.680
to save your context and give back the processor

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.700
to me so that I can schedule it,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.990
for some of the operating systems. And let's say

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.000
OS1 takes more time than is allowed to at

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.180
the point of this context, which, in that case,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.490
what will happen is exokernel will remember that

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.200
OS1 misbehaved And it will take time off of

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.590
OS1 the next time it is scheduled. For there's

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.390
a penalty associated with exceeding the time quantum. The

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.120
time quantum is bound. During this time quantum, OS1

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.370
has complete control of the processor, and exokernel is

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.770
not going to get in the middle of it, unless

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.346
a process that is running on behalf of OS1

00:02:33.346 --> 00:02:36.480
incurs a page fault. In that case, exokernel has

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.330
to come in the middle in order to field

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.720
that page fault and pass it up to the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.990
operating system. And otherwise, during this time quantum, the operating

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.890
system is entirely at liberty to use a processor

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.680
for running whatever processes it wants to. At the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.380
end of the time quantum, the time integer goes

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.380
off. Exokernel feels it and kicks it up to the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.520
operating system and tells the operating system to clean up its act. Save

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.665
any context it wants so that the CPU can be reallocated to the next library

00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:16.340
operating system. And that's where the time is bounded, as to how much time

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.320
the library operating system can take in order to do that saving of the context.
