Hi and
welcome to educational technology.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.660
My name is David Joyner and
I'm thrilled to bring you this course.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.320
When we started this
program back in 2014,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.200
I would have wondered if a course
like this was actually possible.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.590
Most of our online courses
are built around their lectures.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.650
And while conversations and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.440
discussions do happen, they usually
aren't foundational to the course.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.020
But when this course is taught on
campus, there are no lectures.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.640
It's all discussions, conversations,
activities, project presentations.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.160
There's nothing really that we can
pre-prepare, and so I would have

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.420
wondered if a course like this would
translate to the online environment.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.992
And, in fact,

00:00:28.992 --> 00:00:31.990
that was one of the main criticisms
that some people had of this program.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.740
People said that you can't have a real
Master's program without a lot of

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.800
interaction between teachers and
students, but

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.280
you can't have that interaction online.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.830
And so

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.710
they wondered if you could actually have
an effective online Master's program.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.720
But then we started to actually
deliver our courses and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.340
we found something interesting.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.950
Not only could we have discussions
online that were as good as we have in

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.170
person, but
oftentimes they were actually better.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.140
The structure of the online interface
gave students a lot of power to propose

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.620
and guide their own discussions,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.750
and students responded to that ownership
by really making the classes better.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.972
So it's really because of you
all that this class is here.

00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:06.920
You all showed us that we could have
a class like this in an online program.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.520
In this class, we're going to try and
push that envelope even further.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.080
We're going to try and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.400
build an entire class around those kinds
of interactions and conversations and

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.720
discussions without any
pre-prepared lecture material.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.010
We're going to build the entire class
around a project to really try and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.525
build something that's
a useful contribution to

00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:22.950
the educational technology field.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.070
We're looking forward to
seeing what you come up with.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.680
And we're really excited to get started.
