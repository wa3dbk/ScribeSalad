One of the most important factors in an immersive user

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.950
experience on a mobile device is touch interaction. You expect a

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.630
responsive interaction from a device that you hold in the palm

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.870
of your hand, and with most mobile screens, your primary pointing

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.290
device is your finger. As a mobile web developer, you

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.130
need to be sure that you're building great touch enabled user

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.160
devices. Now before we get into the details of the touch

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.700
API's I wanted to share a few simple user interface guidelines.
