00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.040
In this lesson,

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.710
we'll use the same pattern to add
cards from movies from a database.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.800
Cards can be created to display
any type of data you want.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.950
After all, they're just views.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.240
For example, to display a movie card,
you could create a view with an image

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.040
view for art work, and
a text view for the title.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.130
Here, we'll actually
use an image card view,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.760
which is provided by
the Leanback library.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.290
First, let's take a quick look at
what our movies database looks like.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.080
I'm back inside the LoadRows method now,
and

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.120
I'm going to uncomment the line
that loads our dummy database.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.760
By the way, our dummies database is
actually going to pull images over

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.020
the web, so you'll need an internet
connection from here on out.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.870
Let's check out the Movie class.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.650
Basically a Movie is a simple container
class with a title and a description,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.250
and a couple of images
that we'll get to later.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.720
The setup movies method creates
five movies with this data.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.820
Now we'll create cards to display these.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.340
Back inside the low rows method,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.690
I'm going to undo
the comments I did earlier.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.400
And by the way, the UI that we're
going to create will contain

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.340
rows of five videos,
organized randomly and repeated.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.020
First, we'll create a presenter that we
can use to create views for our movies.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.319
Let's take a look inside this class.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.640
Scrolling down a bit, as before
there's two methods we care about,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.600
onCreateViewHolder and onBindViewHolder.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.520
This time instead of a text view,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.960
onCreateViewHolder creates
a view using a ImageCardView.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.960
This is a class provided by Leanback and
it's a card with a picture and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.350
some text.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.710
Whereas, previously we passed
a string to our presenter,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.790
here we pass a movie object.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.110
We cast the parameter to
the appropriate type, and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.399
this time,
we set multiple fields on the view.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.850
In this loop, we create a rows of cards.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.840
In a real app, these would be
organized in some sensible way.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.000
Here, we just randomly create
rows of five cards and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.760
assign them a category name.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.020
As before, we need to create an object
adapter that will hold the presenter

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.090
that's used to create views for movies,
as well as the movies themselves.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.540
Here's where we add movies
from our database to it.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.570
And now we create the header item that
will be used for the category name.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.110
Then we wrap the header and
our list of five movies into a list row.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.220
And we add that list row to the object
adaptor we previously created,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.140
that has our list row presenter.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.660
Run your project at this point and
see what you get.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.160
Not.
