00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
The first statement, well you might be tempted to think that because I just called it

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.920
the ultimate problem in NP, but actually when you look at the definition of an NP complete problem--

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.980
it just means that any other problem in NP can be reduced to it.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.830
There could be multiple NP complete problems as long as they have the same hardness.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.210
This here is not true.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.700
If you found a polynomial time algorithm for an NP complete problem, then what that would mean is

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.710
that there would also be polynomial time algorithms for all other problems in NP,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.890
and the reason for that is that for an NP complete problem, we have said that any other problem

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.210
in NP can be reduced to it and that can be done in polynomial time.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.630
If you can solve this problem in polynomial time as well, then you automatically have

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.470
a polynomial time algorithm for any problem that you can find in NP.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.850
And finally, if vertex cover would be an NP complete problem, then clique would be

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.500
an NP complete problem as well because we have shown that you can use polynomial time reductions

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.980
to get from vertex cover to clique and vice versa.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.520
From a perspective of polynomial time versus exponential time hardness,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.550
these two problems are basically equally hard to solve.

00:01:18.550 --> 99:59:59.000
This one here is also true.
