00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.237
This time we're going to find the equation of the line that's perpendicular to

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:08.438
this line. It still passes through the same point 1, 2. We knew the slope of

00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:12.607
this line was negative 3 halves. So, what was the slope of our line be if it's

00:00:12.607 --> 00:00:16.155
going to be perpendicular to this line? Write your answer here.
