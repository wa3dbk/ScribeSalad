00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.330
So, in this particular slide we have the results of our analysis model.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.031
There were classes corresponding to our three major elements and

00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:13.980
then there were associations among the elements.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.850
There was one binary association having to do with displaying the contents.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.060
And there were other ternary or three part associations that indicated how

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.860
the misc, how the three components worked together to make sure that the scroll

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.540
bar affected the lines on the screen, and that the scroll bar handle and

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.728
the position of the scroll bar handle were all right.

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:42.430
Now, in analysis, UML supports the idea of associations.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.450
In design, there are no associations,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.700
in programming languages there are no associations.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.870
Instead there are in UML what are called dependencies.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.890
So part of our process here will be going and taking these associations and

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.370
translating them into dependencies.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.000
Also, the comments which describe the guarantees in the previous,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.170
picture have been translated into or, they, they,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.540
they have the OCL constraints which we developed during the analysis phase.
