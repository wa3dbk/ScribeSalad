00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.802
A spotlight in 3JS is similar to a spotlight in the real world. You shine this

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:06.709
sort of light on something to make it the focus of attention. This emitter is

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:09.732
like a point light in that it has a position. It's also like a directional

00:00:09.732 --> 00:00:12.925
light, in that you have to point it somewhere. However, there's one important

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:16.854
addition. Control of the cone of light it forms. The main control in 3JS is the

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:20.620
angle where the spotlight ends. There's also a fall off exponent that's similar

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.015
to how specular highlighting works. As you increase this number the spotlight

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:28.039
becomes tighter. More elaborate spotlights are possible. For example, this is

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.997
3D Studio Max's spotlight. It uses two angles to control the outer cone, and a

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:35.866
separate inner cone it calls a hot spot. The spotlight can also be circular or

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.953
rectangular. There are no rules about what constitutes a spotlight, and with

00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:42.934
shader programming, you can create any sort of spotlight you can imagine. I

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:45.076
should also mention, at this point, that you can put any number of lights in a

00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:48.250
scene. There's only one ambient light setting, but you can have as many spot,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.510
point, and directional lights as you want. Each light's contribution is added

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.166
to the fragment's final color.
