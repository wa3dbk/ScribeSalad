Well, we know that 8 times 8 equals 64. So 8 is definitely one of the answers,

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:10.790
but, there's one more. Negative 8 times negative 8 is also equal to 64. If we

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:16.280
want to expound upon why this is true, we can write out that each negative 8 is

00:00:16.292 --> 00:00:21.848
equal to negative 1 times 8. Use the commutative property to rearrange all those

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.870
factors, and since negative 1 times negative 1 equals positive 1, we still end

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:28.026
up with positive 64, so our other answer is negative 8.
