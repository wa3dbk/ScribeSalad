00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.286
The x coordinate should be 9. We can follow the y axis down to negative 8, and

00:00:05.298 --> 00:00:10.703
then stay on that horizontal line, y equals negative 8, all the way over until

00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:15.705
it intersects our line. That happens at this point right here. If you go

00:00:15.717 --> 00:00:21.122
directly upward from that point to the x axis, you see that the x coordinate is

00:00:21.134 --> 00:00:26.613
coming from the origin outward 9. We could also check this by substituting

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:31.578
negative 8 into our equation in the spot of y, and then solving for x.
