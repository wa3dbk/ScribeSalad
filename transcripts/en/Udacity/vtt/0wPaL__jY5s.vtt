00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.500
Let's do this exercise together.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.140
Derrick, what labels
did you come up with?

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.890
&gt;&gt; So just like I tried to transfer
the vocabulary we used to describe

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.650
the relationships between shapes and
a figure, I decided to try and transfer

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.660
the vocabulary we used to describe
transformations between the two figures.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.560
So just like X was
unchanged between A and

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.840
B, r is unchanged between C and five.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.520
In this case, s is also unchanged.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.570
It moved, but

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.910
that's captured in the relationship
between the shapes in figure five.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.320
The shape itself hasn't changed,
so it's unchanged.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.930
Just like dot z disappeared,
dot t also disappeared so

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.610
I marked it deleted like we did before.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.210
&gt;&gt; Good, that seems like a good answer.
