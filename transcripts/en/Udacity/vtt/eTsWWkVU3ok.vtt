00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.518
Well, these are the 4 powers of 10 that are to be using or simplifying. Adding

00:00:04.518 --> 00:00:08.467
the exponents, I get 10 squared divided by 10 to the negative one. Now we

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:12.831
subtract these exponents and I get 10 to the 3rd. Our 10 should have a power of

00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:14.355
3. Great work if you got it.
