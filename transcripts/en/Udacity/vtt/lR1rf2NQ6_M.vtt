00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.596
So without even needing to calculate anything, you can see that we chose the

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:09.200
biggest scores to be in the sample. All the other scores are a lot lower. And

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:13.930
so, therefore we automatically know that the average of the sample is going to

00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:18.079
be bigger than the population parameter. So this is just an example where

00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:23.362
sometimes we'll take a sample, and it won't accurately estimate the population

00:00:23.374 --> 00:00:24.053
parameter.
