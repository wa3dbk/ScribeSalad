00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.850
Recall that we had this state
as a kind of hanging state.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.960
It had no successes state.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.330
And we said that, well this state can
be dismissed, but here is a question.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.940
Who will dismiss it,
the generator or the tester?

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.390
What do you think, David?

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.840
So I think the tester would do it.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.670
We could have the tester basically say
any state where there is only one person

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.890
on the side of the river that
has the boat can be pruned off,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.590
because the only way to get into that
state is to send that person over.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.585
And the only way to get out of that
state is to undo the previous move.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:37.665
So my rule would be for the tester,
any time only one person is

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:41.355
on the side of the river with the boat,
throw out that state.

00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:44.015
&gt;&gt; What does everyone else think?

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:45.095
Is David right about this?
