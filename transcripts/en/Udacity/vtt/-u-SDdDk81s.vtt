Let's pick a polynomial function to play with so we can see how the

00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:06.852
intermediate value theorem actually works. I've chosen y equals x cubed minus

00:00:06.852 --> 00:00:11.788
3, and its graph pretty zoomed in looks like this. Notice the labels on our y

00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:16.283
axis and on our x axis. Now which integer values of x does the zero here lie

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:17.609
between?
