00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.144
Let's try to build up some intuition about the inverses of exponential

00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:10.365
functions. Let's use f of x equals 2 to the x as an example to play with. We're

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:13.610
going to think about how the input and outputs of this function, and its

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.074
inverse, are related. So, here's the graph of f of x equals 2 to the x. Just

00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:23.334
like you've seen many times before. And then reflected in the line y equals x,

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:28.898
we see its inverse, which for now we're just calling f inverse of x. We know

00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:32.978
that if we input 3 to the function f, we'll get the output 8, and that means

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:39.456
that if we input 8 into the function f inverse, We'll get an output of 3. We

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.742
know this, because we know that x and y has switched position in our inverse

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:47.002
functions. To find out more about our functions, f and f inverse, I'd like you

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:51.418
to fill out this table. For each value over here, fill in the corresponding

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:56.790
value over here. These are inputs of f, and these are outputs of f. Which means

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.859
these are outputs of f inverse, and these should be inputs of f inverse.
