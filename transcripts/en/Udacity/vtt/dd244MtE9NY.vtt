00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.890
Welcome to iOS development.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.090
I'm Rod, and I'm going to be
your instructor for this course.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.330
In the first part of this course,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.990
we're going to build an app that
let's you record your voice and

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.150
play it back with sound effects.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.350
This course assumes you're familiar
with basic programming concepts,

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.400
like if statements, loops and classes.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.740
You don't need to have written any iOS
apps, or any experience with Swift.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.540
We'll cover everything you need to
know as you go through this course.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.460
Developing for iOS is a lot of fun.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.150
You get to write apps that you
can carry right in your pocket.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.770
Let's start by looking at the steps
we'll take to build this app.
