00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.212
The answer is that scaling and translation transforms are being done. There are

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:07.595
two ways to solve this problem. One is to look at the matrix and see if there

00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:11.320
is some sort of scaling and translation happening. The other is to realize what

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.929
the transform is doing. It's defining a regular box in space by making it a

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.869
different size along each axis, that's a scale, and by moving its origin

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.467
elsewhere, that's a translation. Notice that if the left is equal to the

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.475
negative of the right, which is the common case, the x translation value will

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:29.940
be zero. Similarly, if the bottom limit is equal to the negative of the top,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.522
the y translation value is also zero. This means the box is centered along the

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:38.350
negative z view axis, and so doesn't need to be translated in these directions.
