Here's our fourth problem on working together. It takes Jamal and Danielle 4

00:00:03.454 --> 00:00:07.742
hours to carpet a room together. If each of them worked alone, one could

00:00:07.742 --> 00:00:12.602
complete the work in 6 hours less time than the other. How long would it take

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:17.145
the faster one to do the job? Before we get started to solve, let's see if you

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:21.780
can set up the correct equation. Write your equation here and be sure to use x

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.260
for the variable. Good luck.
