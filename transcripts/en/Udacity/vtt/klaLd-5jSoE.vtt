00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is a pretty straightforward thing to write in Python.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's imagine that we've got a list L--I made a list which is the node centrality values

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
from one of the recent graph that I used as an example.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And we're going to define a subroutine mean that takes a list and initializes total to 0,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
runs through all the elements in the list adding up their values,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then returning the total divided by the length.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This really is just a straightforward application definition with this

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
kind of intermediate accumulative variable.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And so if we go and print the mean of this list, it calculates it as 2-2/3.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Here's that subroutine again just copied over, and I'd like you to answer the question

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
what is the running time of this little i with the mean.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Is it constant, log, linear and logn or quadratic.
