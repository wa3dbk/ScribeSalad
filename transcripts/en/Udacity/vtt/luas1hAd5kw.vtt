00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.155
The value of x that makes this original equation true is positive 9. Way to go

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:09.161
if you got that one correct. It was tough. We can undo the square root on the

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:12.235
left and undo the square root on the right by squaring both sides of our

00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:17.770
equation. And this is the step where you might have gotten stuck. We need to

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.906
square this 2, and square this radical. 2 squared equals 4, and the square root

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:28.256
of x squared is just x. This is why we'll have 4x on the left, and 3x plus 9 on

00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:34.004
the right. Next we can subtract 3x from both sides to get 1x is equal to

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:38.416
positive 9. And finally, we want to check x equals 9 in the original equation

00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:43.549
to be sure we have the correct answer. Substituting 9 in here and here, will

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:48.834
get this expression, which evaluates 0. Since 0 does equal 0, this solution

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:53.300
checks and you can be sure that is our correct answer.
