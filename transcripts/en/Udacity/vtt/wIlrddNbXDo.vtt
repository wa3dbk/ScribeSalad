00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.110
So it is important to get an example I, I think

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.910
that the, the best way to kind of see an example

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.790
here is to draw a little picture for you that tells

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.520
you what the sort of underlying assumption behind ICA is. So here's

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.780
the kind of, or at least the way I see what

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.190
the fundamental assumption of ICA is. And that is this. You're, you're

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.100
assuming that the, there's a bunch of. Things in the world.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.320
And these are going to be hidden variables. And they've got some properties

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.790
that, that are associated with them. Their random variables. They

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.400
are mutually independent of one another. That is if I

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.210
know the value of one it doesn't tell me anything

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.330
about the value of the other. But we don't know what

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.420
they are. And what we get to see are observables. This observable are given rise

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.750
to by the value of the hidden variables and they somehow combine in

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.830
a sort of linear fashion and our job, the job of any learner

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.400
in this case, any unsupervised learner in

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.150
this case is given your observables try to

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.540
find the hidden variables. Under the assumption that

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.290
these hidden variables are in fact independent of

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.490
one another. So, what's a concrete example of

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.530
that? I'm going to give you a concrete example

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.480
of that then I'm going to give you a demo that we found on the web. Okay?

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.350
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.090
&gt;&gt; So, one problem where we know this is true is

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.800
something called the blind source separation problem. So what' s the Blind

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.950
Source Separation problem? It also has another name which is

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.550
the Cocktail Party Problem do you remember the Cocktail Party Problem?

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.850
&gt;&gt; I think so, yeah.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.970
&gt;&gt; So, describe it to me.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.270
&gt;&gt; So, not that I go to a lot of cocktail parties, but if you're

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.340
in a, in a large group of people like in a cafeteria or something like that.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.720
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.980
&gt;&gt; And you're trying to listen to a conversation. It can

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.520
be very challenging because theres

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.505
all these different conversations happening simultaneously.

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:39.633
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:40.870
&gt;&gt; And we need

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.170
to be able to pull out that one source

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.920
that, that we're, that we're caring about, so that

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.270
we can listen to it while kind of separating

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.370
it out from what all the other noise sources are.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.600
&gt;&gt; So what you just described to me is

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.230
that somehow you have a bunch of people, so

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.960
there's Charles, there's Michael and there's a push car.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.640
And there all talking at once. And let's a imagine

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.630
in place of ears we have microphones. And these

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.300
microphones are actually recording everything that well everything that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.040
they hear. So this means that this first microphone

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.520
is going to hear me. The second microphone is also going to

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.620
hear me and so does the third microphone... However,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.490
they're going to each hear me at a slightly different

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.610
volume at a slightly different delay. Okay? Because they're

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.740
placed sort of randomly around the room. You with me?

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.350
&gt;&gt; I think so, yeah.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.830
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.310
surely, Michael, who just keeps talking and talking and

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.040
talking mostly about puns, is also going to be picked up

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.720
by each of the three microphones, and Pushgar, mainly complaining

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.860
that we aren't doing enough quizzes, is also going to

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.290
be heard by the three microphones. In this case if

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.980
we look at our other examples, the people are the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.810
hidden variables. That is, they're the things that are causing

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.090
events to happen in the world. But what we have

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.870
are observable's. Are the microphones, and what it is that

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.890
they're recording. Now, if we're in a small enough room, it

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.500
turns out that physics tell us that, even though our voices

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.940
are all nonlinear and sound doesn't travel in a very linear

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.910
fashion the way that we would like, it turns out

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.770
that in a small enough room with all of the reflections

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.400
and everything, each of these microphones are well modeled as receiving

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.090
unknown linear comment, combination of all of the sources. So this

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.980
means that each one of these microphones actually contains a, a

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.210
different linear combination of each of our voices. Hey, you with me?

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.590
&gt;&gt; Right. And so, really, if I were to give you these three recordings

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.560
and I wanted to figure out what say, Michael Lipman was saying, all that

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.230
information is here, but I can't extract

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.290
Michael Lipman from microphone one, or microphone

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.650
two, or microphone three. But given all

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.210
of these microphones, I can in fact recover,

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.410
just Michael alone or just Charles alone or just

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.570
Pushcar alone, because ICA exactly tries to find this

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.620
notion of mutual independence without losing any information form

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.050
the output. And this model here, of three people

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.470
talking, mostly independently, and being recorded by linear combination

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.710
by different microphones is exactly the model that ICA

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.680
was designed to represent. So, just to sort of

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.390
drive this home, let me give you an actual example

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.730
that we found on the web that they do exactly this problem. Okay?

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.750
&gt;&gt; Sure.
