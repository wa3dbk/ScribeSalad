00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.320
So the true meaning of absolute value is the distance from 0. Let's take a

00:00:05.332 --> 00:00:10.904
closer look at this. If I had the absolute value of 6, I would want to know the

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:16.324
distance of 6 from 0. Okay here's a number line, here's 0 and here's 6. If I

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:22.527
count the distance from 0 to 6, I know I got 1, 2,3 4, 5, 6. So 6 is 6 units

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:30.889
away from 0. So the absolute value of 6 is 6. For negative 9, I want to find the

00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:38.787
distance of negative 9 from 0. Here's 0, and here's negative 9. If I count the

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:43.422
distance or units from 0 to negative 9, I know that I'll go 9 units all

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:48.852
together. So this distance is 9. The absolute value of negative 9 is positive 9.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:54.334
For absolute value, I know that the absolute value will always be positive. I'm

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:55.872
referring to distance.
