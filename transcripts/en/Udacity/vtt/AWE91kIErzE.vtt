00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.769
If the line we're looking for is parallel to the line y equals one-half x plus

00:00:05.781 --> 00:00:11.570
3, it needs to have the same slope as this line, which is one-half. So, you can

00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:17.296
start off by writing y equals one-half x, since this is y equals mx. And then,

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:22.833
we just need to figure out B, the y coordinate of the y intercept. However, we

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:26.890
know the y intercept we're looking for. It's 0, negative 2. So we just add a

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:31.480
minus 2 to the end of this equation. Let's graph this, just to see what it looks

00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:36.227
like. And sure enough, we can see that this orange line, which corresponds to

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.141
our new equation, has the same slope as the original line. But it's translated

00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:45.868
down so it has a different y intersept. These lines are definitely parallel.
