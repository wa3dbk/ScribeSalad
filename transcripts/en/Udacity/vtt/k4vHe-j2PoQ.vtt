00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.050
I am assuming you already
know about Hadoop a bit.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.510
So, here's just a brief summary.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.520
Your basic Hadoop cluster
consists of a name node.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.220
A secondary name node, resource
manager and one or more data nodes.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.810
I'll go through what each
of these does in a bit.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.880
The type of node is determined by the
Hadoop daemon running on the machine.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.450
These dudes here.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.500
Daemons are just programs
that run in the background.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.660
They handle all sorts of fun stuff like,
communication across a cluster.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.640
They track jobs and
resources and run MapReduce code.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.360
When they load data under the cluster,
the files are split the blocks,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.540
then typically replicated
across the data nodes.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.150
So if a data node dies,
your data is still around somewhere.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.790
MapReduce and other tools,
run in parallel on the data nodes.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.660
This increases the effective
computational speed.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.501
The NameNode stores
metadata about the blocks.

00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:58.406
It stores it in a file called .fsimage.

00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:00.140
The NameNode stores metadata about
the blocks in a file called .fsimage.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.720
Metadata is data about the data.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.988
In this case, which block is
stored on which data node.

00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:07.480
It's like an address book for
the blocks.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.520
The secondary name node logs
edits to the file system.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.340
The secondary name node logs
changes to theFS image,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.685
which are then used to update
the file on the name node.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:19.468
It's actually a fairly,
poorly named though.

00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:23.566
The finger name node stores only edits,
not the actual FS image file.

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.620
So the name node dyes,
the block Metadata is all gone.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.215
The resource manager is called the YARN
for yet another resource negotiator.

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:34.000
It allocates resources like C.P.U.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.800
and memory to applications
running on the cluster.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.830
You run all the daemons on one machine.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.950
It's called pseudo-distributed mode.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.150
This is how I set up my computer when
I'm working on MapReduce programs.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.810
In this lesson, you're going to
build a cluster with one machine

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.460
running the name node,
the secondary name node, and Yarn.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.080
The rest of the cluster
will be three data nodes.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.670
Let's get started
deploying your cluster.
