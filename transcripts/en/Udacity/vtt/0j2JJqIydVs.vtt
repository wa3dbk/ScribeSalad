We replace x with negative 4 and y with positive 3. 2 times negative 4 is

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:09.658
negative 8 and 5 times 3 is 15. Adding these two numbers together, we get 7 is

00:00:09.658 --> 00:00:14.488
equal to 7. This is true. For the second equation, we replace x and y, and we

00:00:14.488 --> 00:00:19.521
get negative 4 equal to negative 4. This is also true. Great, another way that

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:22.794
we can check to make sure we have the right answer.
