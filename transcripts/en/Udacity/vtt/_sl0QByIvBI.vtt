00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.650
Let's talk a bit about perspective camera control. The parameter with the most

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.452
obvious effect is the field of view. As mentioned before, this value is the

00:00:07.452 --> 00:00:11.310
angle from the bottom of the view frustum to the top. It also adjusts the side

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.922
to side angle, factoring in the aspect ratio. The field of view parameter acts

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:18.630
something like a zoom lens. As you set this angle smaller and smaller, whatever

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.217
is in the middle of the screen grows larger and larger. For these images, what

00:00:22.217 --> 00:00:26.346
I've done is have the field of view match the camera move more or less. In

00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:29.526
other words, as I zoom in on the model, I also move farther away so that the

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:34.260
model takes about the same amount of room on the screen. As we zoom out the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.264
perspective distortion gets less and less. At the limit, that is, as we attempt

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:41.116
to go infinitely far away and have the field of view approaching an angle of

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:46.148
zero degrees the view becomes an orthographic projection. If you're practically

00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:48.878
infinitely far away, everything you're looking at is at essentially the same

00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:52.330
distance, as far as relative size goes. Which is how the orthographic

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.906
projection treats this scene. This effect of having the field of view and the

00:00:55.906 --> 00:01:00.660
camera movement offset each other, has become a go-to effect in cinematography.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.558
If you want to express something that's weird or dreamlike happening in the

00:01:03.558 --> 00:01:07.888
scene you zoom in while moving backwards at the same time, or vice versa. Give

00:01:07.888 --> 00:01:11.283
this demo a try yourself and see how it looks.
