00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.920
The proof is relatively straightforward.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.939
Recall that sigma star is
the union of the strings of size 0

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.890
with those of size 1,
with those of size 2, etc.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.300
And our overall strategy will be just
to assign the first numbers to sigma 0.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.250
And the next to sigma 1, and
the next to sigma 2, etc.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.680
More formally, we can can define N sub
K to be the total number of strings

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.430
of size at most K, and then use
this to create the correspondence.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.470
Thus, Nk will be the last number
assigned to a string of length k.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.700
So in this way,
1 will get assigned to the empty string,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.300
the only element of sigma 0.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.070
And then the next number
N0+1 through N1 that'll get

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.560
assigned to all the strings of length 1.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.196
And in general, Nk-1+1 through Nk,

00:00:54.196 --> 00:01:00.470
those set of numbers will get assigned
to sigma k, the strings of length k.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.640
Within each one of these arrows, you
can do the correspondence in any way.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.360
Lexographical order is as good as any.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.260
For example,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.830
we can enumerate all the strings
over the binary alphabet like this.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.380
First we assign one to the empty string,
then we enumerate

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.550
all strings of length one,
then those of length two, ans so forth.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.400
This is the main theorem that we will
need here concerning countability.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.490
But while we're on the subject,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.530
we'll say a few words about countability
in general as a kind of bonus.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.130
The same argument here,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.110
shows that a countable union
of finite sets is countable.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.045
Suppose that our collection
of sets is S0, S1, etc.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.220
And without loss of generality,
we're suppose that they are disjoint.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.120
If they happen not to be disjoint,
we can make them so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.690
by just subtracting out from Sk.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.560
All the elements it
shares with the sets,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.710
s0 through Sk-1 then the argument
proceeds just as before.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.880
We assign the first numbers to S0,
the next to S1, etc.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.780
Now it turns out that we can actually
prove something even stronger

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.750
than the original statement here.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.630
We can replace the word finite
with the word countable, and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.580
say that a countable union of
countable sets is countable.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.030
Notice that our current
proof doesn't work.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.690
If we tried to count all of the elements
of S0 before any elements of S1.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.530
We might never get to the elements
of S1 because S0 could be infinite,

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.820
nevertheless this theorem is true.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.940
For convenience of notation, we'll let
the elements of SK be XK0, XK1, etc.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.370
And then we can make each SK
a row in a grid as shown here.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.940
Again, we can't go row by row here
because we might not ever finish

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.860
the first row if S0 is infinite.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.440
On the other hand, we can go diagonal by
diagonal since each diagonal is finite.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.870
The union of all the Sk is
the union of all the rows, but

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.610
it's also the same thing as
the union of all the diagonals.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.960
Each diagonal being finite, we can apply
the original version of this theorem

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.840
to prove that a countable union
of countable sets is countable.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.290
You can also just translate the indices
here on X into an enumeration as well.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.890
Note that this same idea proves
that the rationals are countable.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.570
Imagine putting all the fractions with a
one in the denominator in the first row.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.790
All those with a two in the denominator
in the second row, all those with

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.880
three in the denominator in the third
row, and so on and so forth.
