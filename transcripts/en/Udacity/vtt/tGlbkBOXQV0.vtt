00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.730
Welcome to level two.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.580
This level will go super fast if nothing
goes wrong and even if you have to do

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.000
some troubleshooting, in under an hour
you should have a libgdx game up and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.450
running on both your desktop and
your android phone or tablet.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.050
We'll learn a little bit about the kind
of complex structure of a libgdx

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.280
application.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.520
Learning where to find the code that
is shared between all the back ends.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.790
And where to find the code that
is specific to each back end.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.960
We'll also learn a bit about the tool
that handles all of the compiling of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.220
code and processing of resources
that goes into a libgdx build.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.020
Then we'll build the android and
dust out versions of the app and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.660
we'll call it a day.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.950
You'll be encountering a whole ton of
new tools and programs in this level.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.340
And it might seem a bit
like tool overload.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.610
While you could go ahead and read
a book on every new tool you encounter,

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.370
it'd be really hard to get
anything done that way.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.890
So the best way to learn a tool
is really just to start using it.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.990
And for my part, I'll do my best
to contextualize every new tool we

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.940
encounter so
that they don't seem so mysterious.
