00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:01.867
So, that’s all I’d like to say about Path Links for

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:04.645
now. Next I want to focus for a little while on the

00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:08.010
notion of a clustering coefficient. Now, you might

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.816
be less familiar with this notion of clustering

00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:13.021
coefficient than you are with paths and graphs, so

00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:16.688
let’s go through how this is often defined.

00:00:16.688 --> 00:00:19.464
What the clustering coefficient is trying to capture is,

00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:22.560
as I said before, cliquishness. How likely is it that

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.045
two nodes that are connected are part of some kind

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:31.022
of larger highly connected group of nodes? So one

00:00:31.022 --> 00:00:34.155
typical way of defining the clustering coefficient is to

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:36.593
start-off by taking about the clustering coefficient for

00:00:36.593 --> 00:00:39.116
a particular node in a graph, I’m going to generalize

00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:41.412
this to clustering coefficients for the entire graph

00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:44.336
next, but let’s focus on a single node. So say, V is

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:50.043
that node and Kv is its degree and Nv of V is the

00:00:50.043 --> 00:00:53.171
number of links between the neighbors of V. So, let’s

00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:55.419
look at this example graph to ground out some of

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:58.997
these concepts. So here we’ve got graph, let’s call

00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:01.807
this node V. Could point to any of them but I’m going

00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:04.029
to go with this one. Let’s take a look at the neighbors

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:06.390
of V. Those are the nodes that are directly

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.506
connected to V in the graph. We’ve got this one, and

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:15.790
this one, and this one, and this one. So the number

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.421
of those neighbors is exactly the degree of V, which

00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:23.528
in this case is 4. And now let’s look at the links

00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:28.485
between these neighbors of V. So, there is this one

00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:33.458
that goes between the two pink nodes and that

00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:36.263
seems to be it. This node isn’t connected to any

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:38.616
other pink node. This one is not connected to any

00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:40.401
other pink node. This is not connected to any pink

00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:45.847
node and so on. So in this case, Nv is 1. And we are

00:01:45.847 --> 00:01:47.843
going to combine these quantities together as

00:01:47.843 --> 00:01:52.243
follows. We take twice the number of neighbor links

00:01:52.243 --> 00:01:55.626
divided by the degree of V times one minus the

00:01:55.626 --> 00:01:59.304
degree of V. Now, this may look a little odd but let’s

00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:02.907
compute what it is and then I’ll explain it. So in this

00:02:02.907 --> 00:02:09.235
case, two times Nv just one, divided by K times K

00:02:09.235 --> 00:02:12.651
minus one. So it’s four times three. And the result we

00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:15.944
get in this case for this particular V is 1/6. So what

00:02:15.944 --> 00:02:18.663
this represents is actually the fraction of possible

00:02:18.663 --> 00:02:22.855
interconnections between the neighbors of V. So,

00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:25.478
because it’s a fraction, we’re expecting it to be

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.704
something between zero and one. And in fact we

00:02:27.704 --> 00:02:30.714
can get zero if we’ve got something that’s like a star.

00:02:30.714 --> 00:02:33.896
So V has edges going out but none of those connect

00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:37.396
to each other. And it can actually be all the way to

00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:42.330
one if we have a cleek. So V is connected to its

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.618
neighbors and all the neighbors are connected to

00:02:44.618 --> 00:02:47.776
each other. So that’s why this formula has the form

00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:51.535
that it does, Kv times Kv minus one all divided by

00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:55.682
two is the maximum number of connections among a

00:02:55.682 --> 00:02:59.323
set of nodes of size Kv. So, we take the reciprocal of

00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:02.282
that multiplied by Nv that gives us the fraction that

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:08.897
we’re looking for. So, in this case V is a sixth, it’s you

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:12.653
know a six of the way from being a star to being a

00:03:12.653 --> 00:03:15.381
cleek. So it’s not that tightly connected and in fact

00:03:15.381 --> 00:03:18.686
you know that sort of what we saw as well that V is

00:03:18.686 --> 00:03:19.967
connected to a bunch of neighbors but they are not

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:22.982
really connected to each other all that much. I am

00:03:22.982 --> 00:03:25.964
going to say that the clustering coefficient for graph

00:03:25.964 --> 00:03:28.228
is just the average of the clustering coefficients of

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:31.249
the nodes in the graph. So if we wanted to compute

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:33.395
the clustering coefficient of this graph, we’d actually

00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:35.697
have to go through node, to node, to node, to node,

00:03:35.697 --> 00:03:37.651
to node, to node, to node, compute the clustering

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:41.000
coefficient for each one and then average.
