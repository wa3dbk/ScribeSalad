00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.937
The first expression would be 2 to the 4th n cubed. I moved the n from the

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:07.950
denominator to the numerator since it has a negative exponent. For this

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.910
expression, I move the base of m to the denominator and the base of n to the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.152
numerator. Here, these 2 bases come to the numerator. So aha, I know these two

00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:20.543
are equal. This one doesn't match these other expressions, so it's out. For the

00:00:20.543 --> 00:00:24.703
second one, the m and the n both move to the numerator with positive exponents,

00:00:24.703 --> 00:00:28.891
but the 2 stays in the denominator, because the exponent is a positive 1. This

00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.989
one would be out, too. For this last one, I have a negative sign in front of the

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.209
2. This is not an exponent, so I just list the negative 2 in the denominator.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.566
The n to the negative 3, however, moves up to the numerator because the exponent

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:45.272
is negative. This doesn't match these, so it's out as well. For the last

00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:49.237
problem, the two moves up to the numerator because the exponent is negative as

00:00:49.237 --> 00:00:53.064
well as the m. This definitely matches the other expressions. So here are the

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:56.995
three. This was a really tricky quiz, so don't worry if you didn't get it right

00:00:56.995 --> 00:01:01.611
on the first try. I really wanted you to focus on negative exponents, negative

00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:05.914
numbers, and negative exponents for numbers. We have to keep in mind these

00:01:05.914 --> 00:01:08.352
differences when working with problems.
