Since we're going to be doing a lot of math together in this course, a great

00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:09.325
place to start would be by talking about numbers, since we'll use them all the

00:00:09.337 --> 00:00:14.177
time. What is a number really? Well, it's not a thing out here in the world that

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:18.553
we can see and touch. I at least have never seen a three or a negative 15 and a

00:00:18.565 --> 00:00:23.664
half walking around anywhere. Instead, numbers are abstract and we use them as

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:28.549
tools to talk about things that we find around us. A kindergarten teacher, for

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:33.365
example, needs to make sure that none of her students gets lost when she takes

00:00:33.377 --> 00:00:37.886
them on a trip to the zoo. One way she could do this would be by constantly

00:00:37.898 --> 00:00:42.677
looking at a list of their names and double-checking that every child on the

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:47.536
list is in the group, but this would get really tiring and probably wouldn't be

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:52.207
all that effective. What do you think might be a better way of doing this? Our

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.945
first quiz of the course will be a really kind of silly question, but, let's go

00:00:56.957 --> 00:01:01.683
with it. How could a teacher make sure that none of her students get lost at the

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:06.887
zoo? And here are a couple of answers that you get to choose from. Tell them all

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.233
to be responsible for themselves and not run off. Your second choice is hope for

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:17.363
the best. Your third choice is count them. Your last choice is they probably

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:22.278
shouldn't go on the trip at, at all, just to be safe. Please click the circle

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.214
next the choice below, that you think is the best answer. When you've picked

00:01:27.226 --> 00:01:31.042
