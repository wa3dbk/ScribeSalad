00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.340
If these are our critical regions with the probability in each region, .025 to

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.564
make a total alpha level of .05. And remember this is the t distribution. And

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:21.589
this t value here is negative 2.042. And this t value is positive 2.042. 2.58

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:30.348
falls above 2.042. And if we had gone the opposite direction, negative 2.58

00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:37.551
falls below negative 2.042. Therefore, we'll reject the null. It appears that

00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:42.017
meal prices in Wilma and Gettysburg are statistically different at a

00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:48.190
significance level of .05. If we calculate the p value, remember our t

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.259
statistic is 2.58 and our degrees of freedom is 30. GraphPad tells us that the

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:58.773
two-tailed p value is .015, and that is indeed less than our alpha level of

00:00:58.773 --> 00:01:04.370
.05. Great job. We're done with this example.
