00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.725
Rather than ending on a morbid note, let's go back for a recap of the lesson.

00:00:03.725 --> 00:00:08.720
Development closing points. If mothers are exposed to toxic chemicals while

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.606
pregnant, the cognitive and neural development of the fetus may be permanently

00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:17.110
affected. Babies spend more time in REM sleep than adults do because there is

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.584
more neural growth going on. Children are born with a biologically based

00:00:22.584 --> 00:00:26.995
temperament that interacts with parenting style to create attachment styles.

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:30.715
Attachment and emotional contact is just as important as food for healthy

00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:35.469
development in infants and young children. The adolescent brain is still

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.722
growing and this affects teens' ability to control their impulses. The

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:43.203
intelligence we gain from experience does not decline as we enter late

00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:47.097
adulthood but our processing speed, mental quickness and abstract reasoning

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:52.331
capabilities do. Humans develop in a similar way although the age at which we

00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:56.719
reach developmental milestones differs from person to person.
