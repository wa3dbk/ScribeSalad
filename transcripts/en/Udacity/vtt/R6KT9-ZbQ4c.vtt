00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.841
&gt;&gt; So remember, this was the data set from the general population distribution.

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:09.657
Now let's find the standard deviation of our sample of social networkers, and

00:00:09.657 --> 00:00:14.609
compare it to this standard deviation. Notice how when we did this, we were very

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:19.619
organized. We found the mean, we found the deviations from mean, we squared each

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.133
deviation, we took the average And then we took the square root, to get the

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:29.130
standard deviation. So finally, find the standard deviation, of this sample, of

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.424
size 10, and of people with the social network. We're going to ignore Mark

00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:38.192
Zuckerberg, he's no longer part of our sample. I recommend you organize it like

00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:42.656
we did before, where you have a column of the deviations, and a column of the

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:47.068
squared deviations. This is going to take you awhile, especially because it's

00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:51.520
probably your first time calculating the standard deviation by hand. So take

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.790
your time, because the important thing is that you really understand how to do

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.372
it, and what it is. And when you're done, put your answer here.
