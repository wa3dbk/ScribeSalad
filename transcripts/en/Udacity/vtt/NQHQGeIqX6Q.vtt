00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.750
So after the get number of characters method I'll add another method. From the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.067
fact sheet we can see that the index of method will help us. We want to return

00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:15.364
bookText.indexOf Mad hatter. Now we need to add that line to our test program,

00:00:15.364 --> 00:00:18.004
BookTester which prints out the actual value of

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:24.445
Alice.firstOccurrenceOfMadHatter, looks like I capitalized it wrong. Alright,

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:29.435
now let's see what this actually gives us. Huh, the actual value is negative

00:00:29.435 --> 00:00:34.715
one. That doesn't sound like a location. There shouldn't be a minus one

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:38.700
character in the book. Let's look at the documentation. In my browser, I'll

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.930
search for java 7 string and find the official documentation. And then I'm

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.065
going to look for the index of method. Methods, index of, we're giving it a

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:52.461
string. Alright, returns the index within this string of the first occurrence

00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:57.237
of the specified substring. That's what we were expecting. The returned index

00:00:57.237 --> 00:01:03.083
is the smallest value, k, for which this dot starts with stir, k. Not sure what

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:07.762
that means yet, we can think about that later. If no such value of k exists.

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:12.869
Then minus 1 is returned. Okay, so minus 1 means that there are no occurrences

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.148
of Mad Hatter as we wrote it in the book. This might be surprising. The Mad

00:01:17.148 --> 00:01:21.570
Hatter is a famous charater. But it turns out, in the book, he's always just

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.050
called the Hatter, not the Mad Hatter.
