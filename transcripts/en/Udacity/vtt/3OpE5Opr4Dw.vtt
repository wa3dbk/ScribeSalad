00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
And there are two correct answers here.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.530
So the first one is if we were able to show that P=NP, well then, each single class here

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.530
would lie in P because these are all problems that lie in NP as we said.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.619
So, all of these classes here would become P,

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.860
which means that if we were indeed able to show that P=NP,

00:00:18.860 --> 99:59:59.000
then this whole picture here could just be written like this.
