00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.019
Now suppose you implement
par.for in this way.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.350
Let's replace par.for
with a procedure call.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.834
This procedure call takes the function,
or the loop body,

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:12.653
as well as an iteration range.

00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:14.533
In this case 1 to n.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:18.040
The procedure call itself
is implemented as follows.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.960
We figure out how many
iterations there are,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.140
call that little n if there's only one
iteration, and we'll call foo on a.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.710
Otherwise, we'll do divide and conquer.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.075
Essentially breaking the iteration
range a to b into a to m-1, and m to b.

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:38.830
Where m is approximately the midpoint.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.120
This scheme will give you the usual
sort of binary tree recursion.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.790
So if you ask, what's the span of
this DAG, it should be logarithmic.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.102
Now what I've just given you is a much
more realistic way to implement

00:00:51.102 --> 00:00:52.510
a parallel for loop.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.055
So what I want you to do from now on
is to assume this implementation.

00:00:57.055 --> 00:01:02.017
That means if I tell you that the loop
body of a par.for has constant cost,

00:01:02.017 --> 00:01:05.553
and I ask you what the span is,
the span will be log n.

00:01:05.553 --> 00:01:09.588
And, again, this is in contrast to
assuming that the span is, say,

00:01:09.588 --> 00:01:11.350
constant cost.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.020
Which is what it would be in theory.
