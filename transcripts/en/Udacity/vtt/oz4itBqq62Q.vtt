00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.450
So let's dive in to supporting Touch Events,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.300
presuming that you really need to. Touch is supported

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.560
across all major mobile browsers and Chrome, Firefox, and

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.960
Opera on desktop as well. So touch has its

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.610
own set of events, touch start, touch move,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.740
touch end, and touch cancel. These are somewhat analogous

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.700
to the Mouse Events. Mouse down, mouse move and

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.330
mouse up. Although Mouse Events have only one pointer.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.440
So the target element and coordinates of the Mouse

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.444
Event are just on the event object. The Touch Events

00:00:30.444 --> 00:00:33.390
are multi touch. So there are three lists of touches

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.230
on each touch event object. All the active touches All

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.970
the Touches that are affecting the current DOM element

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.870
and all the changedTouches. In each of these lists, each

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.730
individual Touch is represented by an object that contains a

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.000
unique identifier for the Touch, the coordinates of the Touch,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.680
and the target DOM element in the page. Although

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.780
this is an important difference. Touch events are always

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.870
delivered to the element that first received that Touch.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.500
They don't walk across boundaries like Mouse Events do. So

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.850
it's important to hook the right elements. In fact,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.670
it's a good idea to add the touchend handler during

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.360
your touchstart handler. And, keep in mind too that

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.020
even if you remove a DOM element from your tree,

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.760
it still gets the events until the touch ends.
