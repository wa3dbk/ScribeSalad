00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.850
Okay, now let's put this methodology to

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.939
work. Specifically, we're going to look at how to

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.260
synthesize a TCP IP protocol stack using

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.920
this methodology. Starting point of course is the

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.200
IO otometer. We specify the protocol in

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.500
all the detail that we want, abstractly. That's

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.893
the abstract specification of the protocol. And

00:00:21.893 --> 00:00:25.457
we can prove that this abstract specification meets

00:00:25.457 --> 00:00:28.940
the properties that we want in the protocol, using

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.377
the IOA framework. And from the abstract specification, through

00:00:32.377 --> 00:00:34.213
a whole bunch of refinements, we can get to

00:00:34.213 --> 00:00:37.230
the concrete specification. We saw that already. Those are

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.120
the two steps that we already mentioned how we

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.210
take and synthesize in complex software. The next part,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.870
how do we synthesize the stack from the concrete

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.940
spec? In other words how do we generate this code,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.920
the O comma code. That represents this abstract specification for the TCP/IP

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.240
protocol stack. So we need to have a starting point for that. The starting point

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.810
to get an unoptimized Ocaml implementation starting

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.010
from this concrete spec, is to use

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.000
this on symbol suite of microprotocols. That

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.010
the authors of this ensemble paper that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.990
I've assigned to you have synthesized at Cornell. Why use

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.550
ensemble? Well, remember, our goal is to mimic the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.510
methodology that is used in building real site, large-scale,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.000
realized circuits. I mentioned at the outset that today,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.470
building a billion transistor CPU chip, the way it works is they

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.950
use a component-based design, taking components of hardware

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.180
structures that have already been implemented And assemble them

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.750
together in order to realize this big, mammoth

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.440
chip. And we are trying to do the same

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.040
thing for building complex software systems. So the

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.260
starting point has got to be a set of

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.650
components, and that's what Ensemble Suite of microprotocols

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.750
give you. Now, if you think about a protocol

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.880
like TCP IP, that protocol has a lot of features in it, and each of those

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.940
features require nontrivial amount of code building. So, for instance TCP IP has

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.670
mechanisms for sliding window management... Flow control,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.140
congestion control, scattering and gathering packets in

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.480
order to assemble messages into units that

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.800
can be delivered to the application. All of

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.300
these things are features of the TCP/IP

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.330
protocol. And the ensemble suite of microprotocols

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.790
has components for each of those functionalities.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.140
That you might have in any complex transport

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.770
protocol, like TCPIP. And if you recall the paper that we read earlier by Tacket

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.980
and Levey about optimizing RPC in a local area network, we said that one size

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.980
fits all is not a good way to

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.410
think about designing complex software systems. Depending on what

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.700
the environment is, you have to adapt what the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.900
layers of systems off it do. And therefore, even

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.830
though the TCP/IP protocol is well laid out in

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.640
terms of what the functional requirements are, whether we

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.640
need all of the components in a particular implementation

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.130
of TCP/IP or not is something that is up

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.870
for the designer to decide. And having

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.670
a suite of micro protocols, gives you that

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.230
freedom to mix and match the components that

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.540
make sense in this specific environment for which

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.770
to building a protocol stack. And that's the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.220
reason for using the ensemble suite of micro

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.040
protocols. It has about 60 protocols that makeup

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.240
the whole ensemble suite. The suite of micro

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.885
protocols of ensemble written in Ocaml and

00:03:51.885 --> 00:03:54.270
[UNKNOWN] component based design of a complex

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.030
system such as TCPIP protocol stack. And

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.930
the micro protocols have well defined interfaces that

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.030
allows composition. Every micro protocol has an

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.860
interface for the layers that sit on

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.470
top of it. An interface for interacting with layers that sit below it. And this

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.839
is exactly the kind of component that you want

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.190
so that you can actually assemble these components layer

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.730
by layer in order to get the functionality that

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.750
you want for the original protocol stack that you

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.570
intended to build. Just to reiterate what we said

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.860
in the, as the, just to reiterate what we

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.350
set as the original goal, we want to mimic

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.170
VLSI design in building a complex software system. And this

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.820
well defined interfaces of the on

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.710
symbol, microprotocol suite facilitates component based design.
