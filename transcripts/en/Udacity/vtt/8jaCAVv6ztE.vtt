00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.286
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; First things first, we square both sides, just like we decided to. Squaring

00:00:05.286 --> 00:00:10.432
the left-hand side just gets rid of this exponent of one-half, and we get 2 x

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:15.753
plus 4. 5 squared is 25. So, 2 x plus 4 equals 25. Now, things are super easy.

00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:21.135
We keep doing our regular old algebra until we get to a final answer of x equals

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:25.987
21 over 2. This, of course, is equivalent to 10.5, so you could have that as

00:00:25.987 --> 00:00:30.472
well, or 10 and one half. Let's check this just to be sure, since this is sort

00:00:30.472 --> 00:00:35.252
of a new kind of equation for us. Dealing only with the left hand side of the

00:00:35.252 --> 00:00:40.162
equation, I plug in 21 over 2 in the spot of x. We get to the square of 25 which

00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:42.225
is, of course, 5. And this works.
