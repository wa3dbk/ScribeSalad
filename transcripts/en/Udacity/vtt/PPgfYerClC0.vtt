00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You know a magic formula we can compute the ± term of the confidence level.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And here's how it looks like, where we've replaced the analytic variance

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
by the empirical variance over here, but otherwise, it's the same as before.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I just calculated this, and here's what I get.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For this sample, that means, we would say between the probability 0 and 1,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we believe most likely the coin was biased and has a 0.754 probability.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We are quite sure we have a confidence interval that's 0.42 wide on both sides.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In fact, it reaches beyond 1, which is a funny side effect of this in the normal assumption.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is the interval in which we are uncertain about what the correct value of the coin is.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In fact, this one does include 0.5--it could be that this coin is perfectly unbiased.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
0.75-0.42 is much smaller than 0.5. Obviously, it's a small sample.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's do the same thing for a larger sample, and this one is a quiz for you.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Here's the sample. I've ordered it. There's three tails and seven heads.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I want you to just compute for me the mean plus/minus this confidence interval with the term.

00:01:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please give me both numbers.
