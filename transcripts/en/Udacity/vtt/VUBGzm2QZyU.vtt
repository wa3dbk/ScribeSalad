00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.019
The final advantage of fragments, 
doesn't involve user interfaces at all.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.685
As you know, as visual components, 
activities are destroyed and recreated,

00:00:07.685 --> 00:00:09.780
whenever the device
configuration changes.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.983
Most notably when the 
screen orientation switches.

00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:13.926
That makes sense, 
because there's a good chance

00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:17.080
we'll want to create a different layout, 
to better suit the new configuration.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.020
But, if we can use fragments 
to break up visual activity modules,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.193
why not logical ones as well?

00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:24.266
It turns out we can do exactly that.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.060
And because these
fragments are non-visual,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.660
there's no need to recreate them
every time the UI needs updating.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.400
Within the onCreatehandler
of your non-UI fragment,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.013
call setRetainInstance, 
passing in true, and return null,

00:00:38.013 --> 00:00:40.126
within your onCreate view handler.

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:43.670
Then, once the parent activity is created, 
you can kick off any connections,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.900
threads or tasks that are bound
to the lifetime of the activity,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.970
which don't need to be interrupted 
every time the device rotates.
