00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.136
This is the equation we can write. Again, the key here is the total amount it

00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:10.037
takes for Katrina to go upstream and downstream is 4 hours. So, if we add her

00:00:10.037 --> 00:00:15.883
time upstream to her time downstream, those should sum to 4.
