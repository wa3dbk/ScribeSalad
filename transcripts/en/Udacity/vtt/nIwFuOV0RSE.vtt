Here's the code added to the render method. The position for the rear camera is

00:00:03.268 --> 00:00:06.629
copied from the regular camera. The rear camera's target is set by computing

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.684
the vector from the front camera's target to the position, and then adding the

00:00:09.684 --> 00:00:12.239
position itself to the vector.
