00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.480
You've just worked with Sarah on a few modifications of our first program, and

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.960
I hope you found that you can make changes to the program without understanding

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.650
all of the bits and pieces. But still, it's a good idea to have a closer look

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.310
and know the lay of the land. First off, as I've said before, these two lines

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.060
are pretty routine pronouncements that you have to do with every program. And

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.970
most programmers don't think about it very much. You know, it's like when

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.120
you're in an airplane and the flight attendant says we're about to leave put

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.345
all your seats in your upright position, put the tray tables back. turn your

00:00:40.345 --> 00:00:45.870
cellphones off. And most people just don't even pay much attention to those

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.727
things anymore. It's worth noting the word main here, that means it's the main

00:00:50.727 --> 00:00:56.460
entry point into the program. It's worth noting the name of the program here,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.220
and all the other things are kind of noise for us right now. Let's focus on the

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.040
important statement. Text like this. That's enclosed in quotation marks is

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.050
called a string. That's just a technical term for the text. This statement here

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.320
prints the string, in the exercise with Sarah you've seen that one can also

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.790
print numbers. If you put a number or a mathematical expression inside the

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.400
parentheses and that gets printed. System.out over here is technically called

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.180
an object. As you'll see in the next lesson, objects are things that do work

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.710
for us in a programming language. This particular object represents the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.775
terminal window, the window in which a string or a number is printed when

00:01:42.775 --> 00:01:49.230
println does its job. Finally, this part is called a method we'll talk much

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.230
more about methods in the next lesson. For right now, just think of it as an

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.140
instruction that's being executed. As you can tell from this part of the name,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.740
the instruction is to print something on the terminal window. What's with the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.389
ln back here? That says that it should also be prepared to make the next

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:15.608
printout appear over here. So if we first print ln Hello World, and then we

00:02:15.608 --> 00:02:21.280
print three plus four plus five that printout will appear here on the next

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.910
line. Without the ln it doesn't make the next printout appear on a new line.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.650
You'll practice working with both of these methods. With Sarah in just a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.900
minute.
