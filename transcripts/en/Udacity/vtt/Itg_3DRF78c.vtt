Hi again. Sadly we've almost come to the end of our time with Grant. However, we

00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:10.139
wanted you to put a name with a face, so here's Grant. But we will help Grant

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.171
with one more problem in the coming lesson, since he's learned almost everything

00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:20.027
he needs to know to deal with the finances of his wiper business. For now let's

00:00:20.027 --> 00:00:24.837
spend a little bit of time reviewing the topics we've discussed in the past few

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:30.372
videos. Parabolas and vertex in standard form, using the quadratic formula and

00:00:30.372 --> 00:00:32.572
transformations of parabolas.
