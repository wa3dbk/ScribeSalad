00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.715
CDN is an example of what is called an

00:00:03.715 --> 00:00:07.360
overlay network. Let me explain what an overlay network

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.370
is. In the previous example, I said my node

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.080
id is 80. And the content corresponding to the key

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.690
149 is stored at my node id 80. And

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.730
this is something the chip discovered, and once you've

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.660
discovered it, you want to come to me to get

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.920
the content from me. But how will you do that?

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.370
What does 80 mean from the point of

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.940
view of the internet? As you know, the physical

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.800
infrastructure of the internet works with IP addresses.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.830
But what you have is 80. It's not an

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.490
IP address. And the operating system only understands

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.050
IP addresses, to route packets on the Internet from

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.280
source to destination. So we need, at the user

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.260
level, because we are doing this sharing of content

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.740
at the user level, a way of mapping such virtual addresses, 80, 60, and so

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.310
on, to IP addresses. So we, as friends, who have decided that well, we want to

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.860
form a social network to share information content,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.690
and so forth, we've exchanged such mapping information

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.820
and constructed a routing table at the user level. And this is what is called an

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.860
overlay network, a virtual network on top of the physical network. So, for

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.640
example, if you, using that SHA1 hash, found

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.520
that your IP address maps to node ID 60, you'll say, okay,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.540
sure, my node ID is 60. And my IP address is such and

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.500
so that is how I'm going to construct a user-level routing table.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.550
All I know is your node ID, and that node ID maps to some IP address.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.940
And I can use this correspondence between the node ID and the IP address,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.034
to have a way of sending information to you. And maybe, a friend of yours

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:04.478
has exchanged routing information with you, and he

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:07.771
has told you that his node ID's 80.

00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:10.231
And he has also given you how to reach

00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:15.180
him. Given that node ID. And you've shared that

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.020
information with me as well saying that you know,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.790
I have buddies, and these are all the note

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.680
IDs of my buddies. So that's how I construct

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.000
this routing table, which is really a table that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.020
consists node IDs of my friends and friends of

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.230
friends, friends of friends of friends, and so on.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.880
That's how I construct this user level routing table. Now

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.510
if i wanted to send a message to my buddy,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.160
let's say B, and his node ID is 60. Because

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.000
B has given me his IP address, when I send

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.420
a message to node ID, I can covert that to

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.130
the IP address, give it to the physical network, and

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.710
it goes to the physical network gets delivered to B.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.980
What if I want to send a message to some other

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.650
node C. I know the node id of c because my buddy b exchanged that with

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.990
me. But I have no idea what the IP address of c is. But on the other hand, I do

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.240
know that b has a way of getting to c. And so in my routing table, what I'm

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.040
going to say is that given a name of

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.290
a particular node, I know the virtualized node ID associated

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.080
with that node, 64B, 84C, and I also know what

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.840
the next hop is in the user space, in the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.270
virtual space of getting to that particular destination. In the

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.750
case of B. I know I can directly send it to

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.050
60, because I have an IP address for B. On

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.360
the other hand, if I want to send it to C,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.720
I have the node ID of C, but I have

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.690
no idea what that maps to in terms of IP address.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.270
I know that my buddy B has a way

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.630
of getting it to C, and that's what I'm going to

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.267
use. I'm going to say, if I want to send something

00:03:58.267 --> 00:04:01.080
to C, I simply hand it over to my buddy

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.020
who's at node id 60. So the routing table says,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.660
given a node id, who's the next hop I should

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.600
give it to so that it'll eventually get there? Now

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.360
the physical network, of course, is much more elaborate than

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.709
this user level, overlay network. Now, for instance, let's say

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.870
I want to send a message to C. His node

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.610
ID is 80, but I have no idea how to send it to him except to know that if I

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.150
give it to my buddy B, who's at node ID 60, he'll know how to get it over to, to

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.720
C. So, I'm going to send it to B, and

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.710
when it comes to B, B knows. From his routing table,

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.860
the IP address for C, and therefore he will

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.860
send it to C and it'll eventually reach C. So,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.360
at the user level, you can see that so far

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.020
as I'm concerned, if my node ID is 50, and

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.370
my node name is A, when I wanted to send a message to C, what I did, was to send

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.040
it to B. And it took two hops at the user level. It took two hops to go from A

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.650
to C, went to B my buddy and B then sent it over to C. So this is a user

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.330
level traversal of the message. But in reality, under the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.290
covers, what is going on, is when I send this message

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.380
from A to B, it is going through the physical

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.970
network and reaching B. And when I send to message

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.220
to A to C. Even though it is two hops

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.050
over here, internally in terms of the number of network hops

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.090
that may have to be incurred in the physical network for the message to reach

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.550
eventually the destination C, it might take many

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.389
more hops. That's what an overlay network is.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.670
A virtual network on top of the physical

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.120
network. And this particular overlay is a content

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.670
distribution network, because it allows content to be

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.130
shared and distributed among a set of users,

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.920
who have exchanged information with one another so that they can

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.120
discover one another, if not directly, indirectly through friends of friends.
