00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.000
Just to illustrate what I mean by this,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.790
I'm going to always return the same thing for every row of my data.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.005
In this case, a JavaScript object that has a single key,

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:16.340
i_love and a single value, data visualization.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.150
And again this is just a toy example that'll hopefully clarify what's going

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.330
on in this intermediate function.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.080
And if we save our file and refresh our page,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
remember there's a debugger in our code right before much of the main,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.900
drawing logic it's called, so we can inspect our data there.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.530
We stopped at the debugger.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.100
If we put right after our D3 SVG data binding,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.920
with our data, and let's look at what's actually contained in data.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.440
The data has the same number of rows in this case 836.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.060
But if we look at what each one of those is.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.580
We have the object that we returned in our intermediate function.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.920
In this case an object that has a single key, i_love, and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.060
a single value, data visualization.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.850
If we use the internal pretty printing function in the Chrome console.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.250
The console.table function on our data we can see our data has a single field,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.990
in this case i_love, that for every row has the same value,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.190
in this case data visualization.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.610
This happened because as we load our World Cup_geo data for

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.710
every row, we first call this function.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.520
And since we always return an object to have a single key, I love,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.100
in the single value data visualization,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.750
which has the affect of making every row exactly identical.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.340
But now let's do something a little more useful and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.630
rather than returning a single somewhat nonsensical data

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.450
object from our transformation function, let's parse our date.
