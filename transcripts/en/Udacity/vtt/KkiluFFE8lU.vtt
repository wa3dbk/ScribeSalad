00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.880
Now that we know what the requirements are and

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.520
their main types, let's discuss where requirements come from and

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.610
there are many possible sources for requirements so I'm

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.610
going to list here the main ones. The first one are

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.440
clearly stakeholders, anybody who is effected by the system

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.830
and its functionality. Customers, users, and so on. The second

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.610
typical social requirement is the application domain. For example,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.380
the fact that my software is running within a bank,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.930
or within a school. Why is the application domain a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.410
social requirement? Well, because there are constraints that are characteristics

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.140
of the application domain that will affect the functionality of

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.130
the system. For a simple example, just think about regulations.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.400
So banking regulations and school regulations in these cases. Those

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.120
are things that might affect the functionality of my system

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.570
and, therefore, that may become part of my requirements. And,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.120
finally, documentation can be an additional source of requirements. For example,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.110
notes, papers, manuals, books. So everything that refers to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.610
the functionality of the system that we're going to build.
