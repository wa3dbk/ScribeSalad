00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.933
The researchers want all participants to believe that they're taking the

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:07.900
medication. This prevents participants from being biased concerning the

00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:11.706
effectiveness of the drug. If they all believe that they're taking the

00:00:11.718 --> 00:00:16.043
medication, then we're controlling for this bias. Not letting the participants

00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:20.346
know which treatment they received is called blinding. Researchers use these

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:24.751
techniques when they suspect that knowing which treatment you're receiving might

00:00:24.763 --> 00:00:28.818
influence your behavior. The inactive pill in this case is called a placebo.

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:33.146
Placebos are fake treatments so that the control group is unaware that they are

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:37.188
being treated differently. When I say they're treated differently, I mean

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.711
they're not receiving the medication The researcher's didn't tell the

00:00:41.723 --> 00:00:46.023
participants which pill they received, because of something called the placebo

00:00:46.035 --> 00:00:50.242
effect. People who know they're taking a placebo, might subconsciously think

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:54.545
that the placebo's not doing anything. And this will influence the results when

00:00:54.557 --> 00:00:59.221
they report how well they slept. Getting back to the quiz answers. This first

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:04.170
option is untrue. Researchers only use deception when they suspect that knowing

00:01:04.182 --> 00:01:08.872
the actual intent of a study may influence the participants behavior. And in

00:01:08.884 --> 00:01:13.395
that case information is kept hidden until the end of the study. These two

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:17.833
options are also not true. Participants in experiments need to provide their

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:21.910
informed consent before the research can expose them to any treatment. Letting

00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:25.645
participants know that they may end up in the control group is part of the

00:01:25.657 --> 00:01:26.535
informed consent
