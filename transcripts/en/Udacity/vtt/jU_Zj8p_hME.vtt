00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.107
What we're looking for in this equation is the maximum value that p can have and

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:07.989
the corresponding c value or the c value at which that p value occurs. Well

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:11.746
remember what this curve looks like overall. It was a problem that opens

00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:15.845
downward. That means that the maximum point here is just the. The vertex. So

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:19.974
that's exactly what we want to find. The C value and P value that we're looking

00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:24.267
for are just the coordinates of our vertex. Let's get this in vertex form, then.

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:28.179
So we need to go through out typical process of completing the square to get

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.421
this forumla in vertex form. Note that it actually skipped one step. That I

00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:36.175
included in the past. When I subtract this constant from both sides of the

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:40.079
equation, I know that I'm doing that in order to get the right side to equal our

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.971
perfect square. In the past I've written out what this entire polynomial is

00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:47.875
multiplied out, and then factored it as a step after that, but we don't really

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:51.980
need to do that. The reason is that I already know the factored form of the

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.534
polynomial that we're creating by adding this before I even add on the constant

00:00:56.534 --> 00:01:00.897
term. The number that I'm adding to c, this negative 46 in this case, is just

00:01:00.897 --> 00:01:05.330
the coefficient of the c to the first term divided by 2. Since that's the thing

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.614
that we're squaring in order to come up with what we're adding the end to make

00:01:09.614 --> 00:01:13.949
this a perfect square. So going through all these steps gives us our final

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:18.557
equation of p minus 290,000 equals negative 200 times the quantity c minus 46

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:23.576
squared. From here we can read straight off that our vertex must be at 46,

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:28.948
290,000. So what does this tell us? Well it tells us exactly the information

00:01:28.948 --> 00:01:34.476
that we were looking for. Grant will earn a maximum possible profit of $290,000

00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:37.962
per month if he makes his wiper sets cost $46 each.
