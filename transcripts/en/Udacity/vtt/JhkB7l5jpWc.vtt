00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.490
In this session, we talked about
some important design patterns

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.370
like delegation, targets and
actions, and model view controller.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.860
These design patterns are woven into
the fabric of app development and

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.470
will come into play in every
application you'll build.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.900
So remember them well.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.990
That's all for now.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.190
We'll see you in the next session.
