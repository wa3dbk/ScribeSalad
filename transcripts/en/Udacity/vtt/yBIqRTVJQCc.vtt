00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.177
The answer?

00:00:01.177 --> 00:00:03.615
And this is pretty particular to sorting networks,

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:06.709
but with a sorting network all will take the same amount of time.

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:10.311
It's an important consequence of an oblivious sorting algorithm.

00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:13.947
Any input will require the same amount of time to sort.
