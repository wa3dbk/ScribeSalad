00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now let's do a little bit of planning. We did row plays. What is row play return?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Well, it's a set of plays where each play is an i-word pair, where i is the index

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
into the row where the word starts. We eventually want to get all plays.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Before we can get there, I'm going to introduce another function called horizontal plays,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which does row plays across all the possible rows,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but only going in the across direction not in the down direction.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That'll take a hand and a board as input. A board is just a list of rows.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It'll return a set of plays where a play, like in a row play, is the position in the word

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
except now the position is not going just to be i, the position is an i-j pair.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's going to be at this column in this row along with the word.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's a set of tuples that look like that. Let's define horizontal plays.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Well, you know the drill by know--familiar structure. We start out with an empty set of results.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We're going to build them up somehow and then get the results.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now, how are we going to do that? Let's enumerate over all the rows in the board.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We just want the good ones--the one from 1 to -1.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We don't want the rows at the top and the bottom, which are off the board or the border squares.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
For each good row, I'm going to write a function called set_anchors which takes the row

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and modifies that row and mutates the row to have all the anchors in it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Remember before when I called row plays I passed in manually all the anchors.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Here, I'm going to have the program do it for me.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now, for each word, I want to find all the plays within that row

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and properly add them in to results.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I want to do something with the row plays of hand within that row.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And I want you to tell me what code should go here.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It could be a single line or it could be a loop over the results that come back from row plays.

00:01:54.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Figure out what goes here so that it can return the proper results.
