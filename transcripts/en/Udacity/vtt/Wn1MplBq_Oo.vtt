00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.130
We are now in a better position to understand the

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.700
details of Network Address Translation. The trick whereby one public

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.980
IP address is able to serve many computers on a

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.650
private network, be it a home, a business or a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.450
coffee shop that we discussed earlier. Recalling our earlier scenario,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.310
your combined modem/router has this public IP address and your

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.610
computer has this private IP. When you send a packet

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.720
to the Udacity site, the router switches out your IP address

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.370
for its own. This way the Udacity site

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.930
will know where to send the response. The router

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.110
also however, changes the port number and the transport

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.570
layer packet and it remembers the translation between. Your

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.530
private IP and port number and this public port

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.150
number that it sent as part of a message.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.330
This way, when Udacity sends a packet back, notice

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.160
how he flips the destination and source IP's and

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.490
the destination source ports. Your router then

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.130
can change the IP and port number back

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.620
so that the packet gets routed to your

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.960
computer. Instead of to your printer, and to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.800
the right application. Like this. So the destination

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.100
IP becomes yours and the port number becomes

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.200
the same one that you originally sent, so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.300
the packet gets routed to the correct application.
