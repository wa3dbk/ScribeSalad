00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.370
Hi, I'm here with Kaushik,
who's one of the co-founders of Locket.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.824
And Kaushik, I'd like to talk to you a
little bit about how you iterate quickly

00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:12.820
and how do you do user testing to make
sure that you have a good product?

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.930
&gt;&gt; Oh sure.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.830
So, once we come up with
the product feature or

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.330
something which we want to build and
try testing it out on our user base.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.990
We quickly list out
all the action items.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.290
And then, we talk to all the people
who are very close to us, and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.090
see what their feedback is.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.240
And then,
we iteratively build on top of it.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.948
We start off from a very, very small
feature addition to current app,

00:00:36.948 --> 00:00:39.286
or we build a very small MVP.

00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:43.604
And then, we test the technology from
users, get their feedback, try to track

00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:47.285
their metrics and see if it is going
in the positive direction or no.

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:50.556
If it is going in the positive
direction, then we take it up,

00:00:50.556 --> 00:00:54.255
improve it, or we remove all
the features which are not doing good.

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:54.856
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:54.856 --> 00:00:58.585
that way we iterate a couple of times
to get to a place where we can release

00:00:58.585 --> 00:00:59.406
an test it out.

00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:02.619
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you talked a little
bit about how you'll contact maybe

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.580
friends or people in your network.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.929
Are there any other specific users that
you'll make sure to go after to make

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:11.901
sure you're hitting
different demographics, or

00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:15.167
maybe particular people who
have certain phones, or?

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:17.187
&gt;&gt; Well, it totally depends
on the kind of application.

00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:19.909
For example,
if you are releasing an application for

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.250
students then we mainly look at
the kind of phones they are using.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.860
And the main, like what kind of
apps they are already using.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.140
And based on their, interest for

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.200
the UI, as well as based
on their utilization ways.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.730
We come up with the features and

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.482
organize it in such a way
that it will appeal to them.

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:41.480
And we also make sure that
the UI is very animated and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.430
very focused to that
particular demographic.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.518
For example, if you are targeting
mid 40s or something,

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:51.150
we don't really need to make it
really colorful and very animated.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.870
But if we are talking to
someone like 14 or 15,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.380
then we want to keep it really
engaging and really interesting.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.820
So, based on all these features,
we come up with a list of things.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.819
Which we try to get people into
the workplace and see how they use it or

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.758
how they respond to that.

00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:10.530
And from there on, build on top of it.
