The question to you is, why do the edges jump from smooth to sharp? What's

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.375
causing the edges to be sharp again? Minification is occurring, linear

00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:11.401
interpolation is no longer being used, on average, each pixel covers more than

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:16.776
one texel, the magfilter no longer applies. More than one answer can be correct

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:18.549
so, check all that apply.
