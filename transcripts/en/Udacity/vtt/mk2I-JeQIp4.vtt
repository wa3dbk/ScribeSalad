00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.700
Once you have capsules available, you can make all sorts of stringy objects.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.190
Here are some helices formed out of spheres. Your job is to make these helices

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.840
out of capsules instead. Stringing together the capsules can be a little tricky,

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.255
as you want to get the end conditions correct. Where two capsules touch, you

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:17.907
want to generate only one sphere, not both. This saves on memory and increases

00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:20.957
performance. That said, you want to make sure that both ends of the helix have

00:00:20.957 --> 00:00:24.870
spheres on them. As a bonus challenge, try not to compute both points for each

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.727
capsule on each loop iteration. It's more efficient if on each iteration you

00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:32.509
compute just one of the points. When you're done, the capsules should look like

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.580
this. There's a parameter in the code called radial segments that you can

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.743
increase to give a smoother result than shown here.
