00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.713
Now we're going to move on to talk about the sensory cortex next. But before we

00:00:03.713 --> 00:00:07.105
do, let's quickly look at what we know about the short term and long term memory

00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:11.375
systems in regards to the brain. Remember that our sensory memories are

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:15.730
processed in various cortices in our brain. Our short-term memory is processed

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.327
in the hippocampus and frontal lobes. And finally, our long-term memory is

00:00:20.327 --> 00:00:24.032
stored in different parts of the cortex and sub-cortex and these memories are

00:00:24.032 --> 00:00:29.327
retrieved with help from areas associated with the prefrontal cortex. Now

00:00:29.327 --> 00:00:33.685
remember that the prefrontal cortex. is the foremost region of the frontal

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:37.095
lobes and it plays a very important role in attention, appropriate social

00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:41.810
behavior, working memory, and impulse control. Those are really importnat to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.421
remember.
