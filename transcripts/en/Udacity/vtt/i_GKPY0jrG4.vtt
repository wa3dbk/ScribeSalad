First, we distribute the negative 1 to each term here. So I have negative 5b

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:10.009
cubed plus 2b and negative 4. Remember, each of these terms, signs should

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.204
change. Next, I regroup my like terms. I have 3b cubed and negative 5b cubed

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:20.510
here. Negative 7b and positive 2b here. And a positive 9 and negative 4 on the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.979
end. And my final answer is negative 2b cubed minus 5b plus 5. Excellent work if

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:27.880
you got it.
