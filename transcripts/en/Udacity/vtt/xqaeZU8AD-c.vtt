00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.890
We've posed the general problem of
supervised regression learning and

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.090
introduced two algorithms
that can solve it.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.110
Linear regression creates
parametrize models and

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.200
K and N is a non-parametric
instance base method.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.770
There are in fact many algorithms
that can solve this problem.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.760
Each algorithm has it's on pros and
cons.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.440
In this lesson we'll look at various
methods for assessing those algorithms.
