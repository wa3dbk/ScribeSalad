00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.506
So actually, using point-slope form this time gave us extra work. If you look at

00:00:04.506 --> 00:00:08.853
which 2 points we had, one of these this first one, 0 negative 2000, is in fact

00:00:08.853 --> 00:00:13.496
the y interceptor of our graph. Since for slope intercept form we just need to

00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:18.168
know the slope and the y quadrant of the y intercept, we could have avoided all

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:22.645
that work we did in the middle, using the point slope form. Instead we could

00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:26.750
have just written 500 in the place of m and the spot of b, negative 2000. The

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.908
moral of the story is that point slope form is super, super useful in certain

00:00:30.908 --> 00:00:35.157
situations. But we need to think critically about which forms of equations we

00:00:35.157 --> 00:00:39.372
should use. Thinking not only about what kind of information we have but also

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:42.315
the actual contents and meaning of that information.
