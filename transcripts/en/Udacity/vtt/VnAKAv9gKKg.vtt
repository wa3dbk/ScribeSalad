00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.121
So we've talked about if-then-else and switch statements as 1 kind of branch.

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:06.188
Loops are another kind of branch.

00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:09.823
So here is a snippet of CUDA kernel code with 2 loops.

00:00:09.823 --> 00:00:14.601
So for both of these loops, assume that this function bar is what's going to take the most time,

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:19.499
that all these calls to bar are going to dominate the total time spent in foo.

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:25.168
And the only difference between these loops is that in this case we repeat a number of times

00:00:25.168 --> 00:00:27.776
which is threadIdx.x%32,

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:33.511
and here we repeat a number of times which is threadIdx.x/32, integer divide.

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:38.058
So as a quiz, see if you can figure out which of these is faster--loop 1 or loop 2.

00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:42.596
In other words, where do we spend total, across the whole kernel, more of our time?

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:45.779
And remember, we're assuming that bar is a really expensive function

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:49.334
that will dominate the overhead of actually calling a loop.

00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:53.884
And roughly how much faster is it? So give me just an integer answer.
