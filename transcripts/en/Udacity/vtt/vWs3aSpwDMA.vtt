00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.948
a equals 7 for this equation. Great work if you found this answer. This

00:00:04.948 --> 00:00:08.512
equation had two radicals. So, we want to split them up, so one radical is on

00:00:08.512 --> 00:00:12.420
each side of the equals sign. We add this square root to both sides of the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.980
equation to get our new one. Now we can undo these square roots by raising both

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.727
sides to the second power. We'll have 4a minus 3 equal to 2a plus 11. We solved

00:00:23.727 --> 00:00:27.753
this linear equation by subtracting 2a from both sides, then adding 3 and

00:00:27.753 --> 00:00:33.464
dividing by 2. This gives us a is equal to 7. Now, like every problem before,

00:00:33.464 --> 00:00:37.690
you want to check this answer in the original equation. We plug in the value of

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.416
7 in for a, here and here. And then we get the expression, root 24 minus root

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:48.344
24, on the left-hand side. We know this equals 0. So, yes, 0 does equal 0,

00:00:48.344 --> 00:00:50.980
which means our solution checks.
