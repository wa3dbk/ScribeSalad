00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.900
Let's tackle this together. Here we have the rightmost value

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.644
of the picture to the left. We'll add ten and then

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:10.280
we translate pic by that amount. That's the statement. Now

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.240
we need to do that for all of the pictures. So

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.940
I need to add the loop header. I've done that

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.624
often enough that my fingers can do it on autopilot. Here

00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:20.980
goes. Pretty soon your fingers will be able to do

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.480
that too. Let's go and compile, and let's run the program.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.140
Hm, that did not seem to work, now did it? Let's see. The program crashed, and I

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.450
am told that there is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.820
index that was out of bounds was minus one.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.945
Well, minus one is not a valid array index. And why would I have gotten a minus

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:50.550
one. Oh look at this i is 0, so over here this i is 0 and then the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.980
i minus 1 is 0 minus 1 and that's bad. Now the problem is that when

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.340
I am at the zeroth picture, that is the initial picture in this sequence. There

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.805
is nothing to the left, so the remedy is to start here. With i equals 1. The

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:15.664
zeroth picture just stays where it was. Picture at index one then gets moved to

00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:18.288
the right of the one at index zero, and

00:01:18.288 --> 00:01:22.160
that's all great. So in this case, my fingers shouldn't

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.050
have been on auto pilot, but I should have thought

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.380
through what values for i, I actually want. It's very,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.857
very common in actual programming to get these kinds of

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:34.360
errors. And I wanted to show how it looks like

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.060
when you do. Now let's try this. And look at

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.830
that, our pictures are finally arranged in a neat sequence.
