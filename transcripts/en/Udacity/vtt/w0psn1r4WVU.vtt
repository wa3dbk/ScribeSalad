00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.835
We've used cube maps for skyboxes and environment maps for sharp and glossy

00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:07.620
reflections and for refraction. It turns out we can even use this same

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.995
mechanism for diffuse lighting. For these previous techniques we needed the

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:13.920
direction to the eye and the shading normal in order to compute a reflection or

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.840
a refraction ray. For the diffuse component, we just need the shading normal.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.465
Remember, the diffuse component doesn't depend on the eye's direction. We used

00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:25.120
the dot product between the normal and the light source vectors when we

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.911
computed the effect of a single light on the surface, using Lambert's Law. Now

00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:33.689
think big. For a particular point on a surface, consider every texel in our

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:37.980
environment map as a source of light, emitted or reflected. Take the dot

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.710
product of the direction vector to each texel from the surface and compute the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.861
dot product with the surface normal. Add these all up. You now have the

00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:49.730
contribution of the entire environment map on a single location. You might

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.160
think doing this is a bit expensive to do for every pixel we want to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.210
illuminate, and you'd be right. Doing this properly is a good task for path

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.590
tracing. However, there are a few things working in our favor. First, once

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.640
you've computed the sum of all the contributions of all the texels for one

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.890
point on one surface, you've actually computed it for all points with the same

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.533
normal direction. Remember that the environment map is infinitely far away, so

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:15.580
what's true for one surface normal is true for them all. The other element

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.060
working in our favor is that a cube map can be used to store the results of our

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.970
computations. After we compute the sum of all the contributions for a given

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.220
normal, we then simply store this value directly at that location, in the cube

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.788
map texture. This texture is called the diffuse environment map, or irradiance

00:01:30.788 --> 00:01:35.172
map. Now when we want to sum total lighting for the surrounding environment for

00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:39.214
a given normal, we can just look it up on the cube map. One other advantage

00:01:39.214 --> 00:01:42.386
that we have is that the diffuse map can be quite low resolution while this

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:45.714
original sharp environment map had cube faces that were 512 by 512 texels and

00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:51.425
our gloss map was 128 squared. The diffuse map is only usable at only 32 by 32

00:01:51.425 --> 00:01:55.773
texels. Nonetheless, it can be expensive to compute the diffuse map, so what we

00:01:55.773 --> 00:01:59.738
do is the same as for the glossy map. We compute the texture in advance with

00:01:59.738 --> 00:02:03.130
some image processing software. This gives us the texture we need to light the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.457
scene. During rendering, we just use the shading normal to find the overall

00:02:06.457 --> 00:02:09.800
contribution of the environment's lighting to the surface fragment.
