00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.867
Here, the correct solutions are positive 3 and positive 6. That's amazing

00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:08.527
effort if you got these two solutions. Now, don't worry if you got stuck or

00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:13.490
don't quite understand this at all, this is only our first practice problem.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.838
Maybe you were able to get the substitution of X minus 2, or maybe even found

00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:21.392
the values of U. Let's go through the solution together, pause it where you

00:00:21.392 --> 00:00:24.272
think you made your first mistake, and then see if you can solve for these

00:00:24.272 --> 00:00:29.695
answers. To perform the U-substitution here, we're going to substitute this

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:37.179
repeated expression, x minus 2, with the variable u. So we'll have u squared

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:43.950
minus 5 times u plus 4. This is the critical step that turns this equation into

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.600
a much easier quadratic equation to factor and solve. We factored this using u

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.626
minus 4 times u minus 1, and then we solve for u. U can equal 4, or u can equal

00:00:55.626 --> 00:01:01.990
1. Nice effort if you found these two variables. But remember we're not done.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.504
We use the substitution u equals x minus 2 so we need to plug in x minus 2 back

00:01:06.504 --> 00:01:13.119
in for u to find the original values of x. So if u equals 4 and u equals 1 then

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:19.775
we know x minus 2 must equal 4... And we know x minus 2 must also equal 1. Now

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:23.984
we just add 2 to both sides for each equation to get x equals 6 and x equals 3,

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:27.000
our final solution set.
