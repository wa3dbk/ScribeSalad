00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.040
This gets done sometimes,
in medical imaging.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.490
So here is a, an old scan.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.610
Probably a, I'm going to guess CT.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.870
And the image on the left
is the grayscale,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.540
and then they've thresholded
the image on the right.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.080
And what you'd like to do is,
you'd like to say, you know,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.030
there's this chunk here, and
there's this chunk there, and

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.790
maybe this chunk, and this chunk,
and some things there, and that.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.600
And maybe I'm going to ignore
some of that other stuff.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.630
The first thing that we're going to
look at is what's referred to as

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.800
a connected component analysis,
all right?

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.840
So some of these
are a little hard to see.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.330
But we'll just focus on
this one right here.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.820
The idea is I'd like to pull out this
thing as being distinct say from this

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.400
thing, okay?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.145
These are not connected so, I would
like to label this maybe as a 2 and

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:53.230
this as a 3, all right because I want to
find all of the connected components.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.460
Or connected set of pixels.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.780
The connected components algorithm or
operation takes a binary image and

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.900
it generates what's referred
to as labelled image.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.350
So every pixel now it used to be a 0 1,
it's now giving it a label

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.880
that is the number of
the object to which it belongs.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.951
So right, if there is just one object,
everything will be a 0 or 1 and

00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:13.922
the 1, right?

00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:16.752
But if there are two objects,
there'll be 0s, 1s and 2s.

00:01:16.752 --> 00:01:19.940
All right, by the way, one of the things
that we're not going to talk about is

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.020
when we talk about a pixel being
connected to another pixel,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.816
there's what's known as 4-way
connected and 8-way connected.

00:01:25.816 --> 00:01:29.110
4-way means that you're connected
to north, south, east, and west.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.100
Did I get those right?

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.765
Well, it depends upon
which way you're looking.

00:01:31.765 --> 00:01:35.167
8-way connected, says I'm connected
to the north, south, east, west, and

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:38.665
I'm connected to northeast, northwest,
southeast, southwest, all right?

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:42.933
For what I'm going to show you here,
we're going to assume a 4-way connected

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:45.722
the, the algorithm is pretty
much the same if it's 8-way.
