00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, wow, you now understand a lot.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You understand the variance which is the spread of the data squared.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You understand standard deviation which is the same without the square,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and the other way to compute all of those in a single pass to the data

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
using only these running counters.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let's try it profound. You're really deep into statistics now.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, let me ask you two tricky questions.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is a secret, please don't tell anybody, but I'm actually considering, at least hypothetically,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to give everybody a raise, and we're lucky to ask is what the effect of the raise is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
on the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of salaries in the company.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm considering two types of raises, a fixed amount of $1000

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and what's called of relative raise of 20%.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now, that changes the mean and/or the standard deviation to potentially different values

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
they call µ’ and σ’ and the changes either multiplicative,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which would be the factor over here, or additive.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If there is no multiplicative change, just put one over here.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Can you guess what the effect is of adding $1000 to your salary

00:01:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
on the mean and the standard deviation?
