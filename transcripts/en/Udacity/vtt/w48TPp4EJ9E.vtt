00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.100
Now what I'd like to do is show you a bunch of examples on how the change of

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.720
just the aperture itself can change the look and feel of an image.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.700
We saw that for changes of shutter speed, where we show motion blur and

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.490
streaks of light.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.220
Let's start off with, completely of course, a closed aperture.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.430
Of course, I'm showing a white.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.910
Doesn't mean it should be completely black.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.190
There's no light entered.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.390
But let's look at, as soon I open the aperture, what kind of images I get.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.392
So this is an opening of f over 3.5, so the end number is 3.5.

00:00:31.392 --> 00:00:35.800
These are my three friends again, and actually hopefully you can see this, and

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.040
we'll be putting these images up for you to look at more carefully, also online.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.040
Much more crisper.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.690
You can actually see the beard and stuff.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.500
But here things start getting blurry.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.650
In fact, my dear friend Einstein is almost out of focus here.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.540
This effect is also sometimes known as shallow depth of field.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.860
And sometimes it's intentionally done by photographers because they want to

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.950
focus more on the front person, and

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.180
not actually pay attention to the people behind.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.020
So look at this, was here, of course, you can't tell much detail of this one.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.560
Let's now start changing the aperture values.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.460
I've closed the aperture a little bit.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.720
Now we are at a 4.0.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.790
Might be hard to tell but

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.390
things have gotten a little bit more in focus at the back.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.020
Now you should be able to tell a little bit more difference here.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.440
again, now we are 5.6, smaller aperture.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.240
Here actually you should be able to see a little bit more detail.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.000
We are at f/8.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.780
Much smaller aperture.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.990
You can actually start seeing his hair.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.241
And Mr. Einstein has gotten a little bit more in focus.

00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:42.600
And you can actually start seeing the vase and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.970
all the intricacies of this vase right here.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.500
The trees are also getting a little bit more in focus back there.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.225
Moving to f/11, increased focus again, smaller aperture.

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:57.536
F/14, now here, you should be able to see a lot more detail.

00:01:57.536 --> 00:02:00.403
Getting much and much crisper, and in fact, this is and

00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:03.636
this is pretty much the same kinds of crispness and sharpness.

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:07.055
There's a little bit more blur, but let's see what we can do with that next.

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:10.860
But f/18, very small aperture, much more crisper,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.590
here you actually can see the vase in more detail.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.330
The tree, the leaves are much clearer.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.460
And the whole thing seems to be a little bit more full and focused.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.500
And there seems to be no, you know,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.870
shallow depth of field kind of stuff back there.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.320
Gone, taking it to f/22, much more crisper.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.837
Just to help to visualize this,

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:32.542
I'm going to just show you three different ones here.

00:02:32.542 --> 00:02:33.863
3.5.

00:02:33.863 --> 00:02:35.530
Very blurry.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.400
F/11, less blurry.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.070
Tree is in focus.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.230
Just switching back for you to see what it was before.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.770
Forward, let's go one more.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.630
F/22.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.290
Twice.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.022
And of course, less light is coming in, for various reasons.

00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:54.770
Yes, we're keeping the shutter open longer, but that's not the point here.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.480
The point is, I'm showing the effects just of this kind of stuff.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.920
You see that this is much more in focus.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.880
Just looking at it closely again,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.690
next to each other, these are the two differences, wider, smaller.
