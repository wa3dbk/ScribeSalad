00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.536
There are whole books written about this algorithm. Though at its simplest, it

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.814
can fit on the back of a business card, such as this old one of Paul

00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:10.355
Heckbert's. There are even ray tracers with amazing animated effects that are

00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:14.915
written in 256 bytes, such as this demo scene program called Tube. Well,

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:18.982
actually, this program is only 252 bytes. The last four bytes spell out the

00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:23.150
author's name, Baze. This is one of the most amazing programs I've ever seen.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.712
This is as far as I'm going to go with ray tracing, but you now have a taste of

00:00:25.712 --> 00:00:30.600
its power. Shadows, sharp reflections and refraction can all be added easily.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.682
There's been much work to make ray tracers generate images at interactive rates

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:37.101
for complex scenes. We're not quite there yet for some applications, and there

00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:40.491
are headaches with keeping a constant frame rate in reasonable quality. But

00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:43.330
we'll clearly see more progress in this area in the future.
