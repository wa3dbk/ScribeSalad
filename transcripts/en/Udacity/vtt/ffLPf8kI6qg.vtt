00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.703
One way to solve this is to define a variable called change and set it equal to tolerance,

00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:08.967
where tolerance is a parameter in our function, and you can see its default value is very, very small.

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:12.010
And, as long as this change is greater than or equal to tolerance,

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.931
we're going to initialize change to zero,

00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:17.621
and iterate over not quite every entry in the path.

00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:22.364
You can see here that we want to exclude the first and last entries.

00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:24.561
And so, for each entry, we're going to

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:29.452
set an aux variable equal to the new path value at that entry,

00:00:29.452 --> 00:00:34.791
we're going to increment newpath, where these are the equations from gradient descent,

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:40.317
we're going to increment change by however much this newpath has changed in this step,

00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:42.547
and we're going to keep doing this and doing this

00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:46.936
until change becomes less than tolerance, at which point

00:00:46.936 --> 00:00:48.568
we can return our new path.

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:54.280
And we see if we run this, we go from this right-angle, jerky path

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.199
to this nice, smooth path taking us from [0,0] to [4,4].
