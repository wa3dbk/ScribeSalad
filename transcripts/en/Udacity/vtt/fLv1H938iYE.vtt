00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.990
Now let's talk through the choices I've given you. yes, the operating system is a

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.710
resource manager. It is the boss in control of the hardware resources. So that's

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.610
a functionality that you do expect from

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.830
the operating system. Yes, the operating system -

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.190
Is the entity that provides a consistent

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.180
interface to the hardware resource. Remember earlier lecture

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.740
on obstructions, I mentioned that operating system is

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.210
a level in the obstruction hierarchy sitting between the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.144
application and the processor and the other resources

00:00:37.144 --> 00:00:40.310
and so in this sense, the operating system should

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.910
be the entity that provides a consistent interface

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.040
to the hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.910
io devices. So yes, the second choice is

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.220
a good one in terms of functionality, that you

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.290
would expect from an operating system. The

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.540
third choice says the operating systems schedules applications

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.720
on the CPU. This also seems like a

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.270
think that the operating system should do because

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.020
there could be multiple applications that require

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.790
these resources and therefore their has to be

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.700
an arbitor that is going to provide a

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.340
way of scheduling. Those requests on the hardware

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.830
devices and therefore yes. The operating system

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.920
is an entity that schedules applications on

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.130
top of the CPU. The last choice

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.800
says the operating system stores personal information

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.940
such as credit card numbers, social security

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.400
number and email addresses. Now this looks

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.600
like something that you wouldn't have want

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.290
the operating system to do. And these are,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.570
these are personal information and you would

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.020
not want the operating system to store such

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.970
information, and therefore this is not a

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.680
functionality that you expect of the operating system.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.780
So the first three choices are the right choices. The operating system is not an

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.020
entity that should be storing your personal information

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.590
such as credit card numbers and so on.
