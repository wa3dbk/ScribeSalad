00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.392
Remember in lesson three how we stored the friends of a person? We had an

00:00:03.392 --> 00:00:07.682
instance variable friends, and when we added friends, we added their names to

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:13.539
the friends instance variable. To remove friends, we replaced their names, with

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.994
an empty string. What if I decided to add some methods that comment on the

00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:22.504
number of friends a person has? And try to use these conditions. Match each

00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:27.208
condition to a description of its error. The errors are; strings are objects

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:31.670
and should be compared using equals. The strings friends will never be null.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.970
Loss of precision may prevent this condition from being true even when a person

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.398
would see that it should be true. And this if statement tries to change the

00:00:40.398 --> 00:00:43.783
value of the variable instead of comparing it.
