00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, here's one way to do it.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In state 2, I could put another edge for a - z,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and now if there's a new input, like abc1, we would start here, a, b, c, 1, and accept.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
However, there's an alternative answer where we add this edge to state 1,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
still labeled a - z.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now if we see the abc1, it's a, b, c, 1.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Both of these approaches work, and you'll just have to decide which one you like more.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This is an instance of creativity.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Typically in computer science, we prefer the green solution

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
because the red solution is a little ambiguous.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Here in state 1, we have 2 edges going out of state 1, both labeled a - z.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That could get a bit confusing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
By contrast in the green solution--solution going off of state 2,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we don't see as much.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We can either transition here on 0 - 9 or transition on a - z,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.327
but we have to always know just what to do.
