00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.500
So, let's think about what we want lookup to do. It's going

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.260
to take a hash table and a word, its output is going to

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.750
be the value associated with that keyword. What we want lookup to

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.900
do is, like add, first thing it has to do is find the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.440
right bucket, and we've defined this

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.520
procedure hashtable_get_bucket to make it easy

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.780
to do that. Once we've found the bucket, what we want to do

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.750
for lookup is go through all the entries in that bucket. See

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.430
if there's one where the key of that entry matches the word that

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.549
we're passing in. So, your goals to define a procedure,

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:32.210
we call it hashtable_lookup. It takes two inputs, a hashtable,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.950
and a key, which is the string, and it outputs the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.440
value associated with that key. Whenever you're asked to define a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.260
procedure, you should think carefully whether the description is clear enough.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.470
In this case it's not. There's a situation that this description

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.320
doesn't cover. We need to think about the case where the

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.950
key is not actually in the table. What should we do

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.400
then? There's a lot of different things we could do. We

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.430
could produce an error. The problem with producing an error is then

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.210
we've got to deal with it when we call it. We'd like to, instead, produce the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.120
value that we can use to represent the

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.150
case where there's no entry associated with that key.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.360
And we'll use the None value for that. So, if the key is not in the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.740
table, the result of lookup should be None,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.020
which means there's no value associated with that key.
