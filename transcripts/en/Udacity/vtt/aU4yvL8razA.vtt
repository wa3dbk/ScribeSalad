00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.000
Here, the only solution is positive 5. Nice work if you got this answer. We'll

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.618
start solving this problem like before. We'll change our equation into

00:00:10.618 --> 00:00:15.595
exponential form, having the x as our base, 2 as the exponent and set equal to

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:20.876
25. We need to solve for x, so I must take the square root of both sides of the

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:26.245
equation. When we take the square root of both sides, we must include the plus

00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:31.725
or minus symbol for the positive and negative root of 25. We know the square

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:38.314
root of 25 equals 5, so x can equal positive 5 or negative 5. But remember for

00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:43.502
logarithms, the base of a logarithm must be great than zero. So, we know that

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:49.683
this value x cannot equal negative 5. So the only value that would make this

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:52.753
equation true would be positive 5.
