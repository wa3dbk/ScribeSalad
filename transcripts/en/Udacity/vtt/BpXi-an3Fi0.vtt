00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.490
So just to keep recap, we basically came up with the whole definition of how

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.160
the exposure triangle works, reminding that basically we are interested in

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.080
this simple math, where we want to be able to get the irradiance times the time,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.370
and use that to generate the exposure.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.110
Irradiance is controlled by the aperture opening, and by lowering the f

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.210
stop doubles the exposure as the aperture is open more.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.740
And by lowering two f stop doubles depth of field.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.130
So this is basically kind of the impact we're looking at throughout.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.450
That by playing around with how the f stops change we can actually impact

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.880
the size of the aperture opening that impacts what the image would look like.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.000
And sometimes by playing around with this, we can actually see impacts on

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.170
things like depth of field and similarly for shutters and stuff like that.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.690
I've showed you many examples in this lecture for

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.560
you to kind of now take it in and play around with your own cameras.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.160
Of course, not all cameras allow you to have this kind of control.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.239
These days even mobile cell phone cameras do have some code available for you

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.600
to play around and change the aperture and shutter speeds and stuff like that.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.570
And we'll try to make them available, but feel free to discuss them

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.440
amongst yourselves and find other examples of this kind of stuff.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.990
Of course, most of

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.060
the examples I showed you were generated using high-end SLR cameras.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.080
In the previous slide I talked about the change of aperture and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.780
now of course exposure time controlled by shutter speed.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.330
When you double this the time, the shutters open,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.930
well your exposure is doubled also.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.890
When you double T well it might actually also double motion blur.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.660
And of course, when you're take ISO, you're doubling ISO basically needs

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.560
half the light to be able to generate a similar type of an image.
