00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.656
Our long division here works here just the same as it always has. When we go

00:00:03.656 --> 00:00:09.870
through all the steps, we end up with x squared minus 6x plus 13. And luckily,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.820
we have a remainder of 0. Which as always, shows that 2x minus 1, really is a

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.505
factor of the expression we started out with. Since the remainder is 0, that

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:20.616
means if we plug in the root associated with this, the function will have a

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:22.249
value of 0.
