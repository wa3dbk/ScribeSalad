00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.320
And the last bit of context that I want to add at

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.570
this point is to display the year being shown so

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.400
that as it animates through, we know what World Cup we're actually looking at.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.240
Let's use the same code we used in our chart example and

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.460
append an h2 tag to the top of our chart and use some CSS to center it.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.300
And if we refresh the page here,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.040
we can see we now have a static title, World Cup, and the animation still works.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.150
But let's go back and make this title dynamic.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.920
And now in our update function that's going to get run for every year.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.180
We can select our h2 tag and change it's text to represent the World Cup and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.840
the year variable that we're updating.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.930
Going back to our browser, we can see here the year properly animates and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.420
we have much more context as to what we're looking at as the map changes.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.550
And now we have a link between what year we're actually visualizing,

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.190
the attendance, how it's changed from one year to the next

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.960
through the animation, but

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.440
also how it's changed depending on which country's hosting the game.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.340
And how the geographic spread of participating countries changes from

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.140
one year to the next, and one host country to the next.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.330
And we're just about done with our animation, and have

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.550
a great author driven narrative that represents the stem of our martini glass.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.760
Before we leave this animation, I just want to touch on D3 transitions, which

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.910
would make any changes to our graphic much smoother and aesthetically pleasing.
