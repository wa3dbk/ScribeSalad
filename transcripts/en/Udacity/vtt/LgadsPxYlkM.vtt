&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, Greg, I was looking at neuroplasticity, and how learning physical changes

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.464
our brain. And I was trying to find a really good example of that, and then I

00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:11.360
came across the example you used in your book about London cab drivers. Can you

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.661
give us a little bit about that setting?

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:16.634
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure. Sure. I'd be glad to. So, yeah, neuroscientists decided to study this one

00:00:16.634 --> 00:00:21.570
group that really is intensively involved in learning. They can't use any other

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.656
map. They can't use a physical map, they can't use GPS so, you really, truly

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:31.260
have to learn this very complicated network of streets. And, it takes months

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.398
and months. And they have to pass a very difficult exam. And then, for a

00:00:35.398 --> 00:00:39.308
comparison group, they chose another group that did a lot of driving. So, they

00:00:39.308 --> 00:00:42.906
didn't want to explain any differences by driving alone. So they pick bus

00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:45.299
drivers. Now, the thing about bus driver is that they don't really have to

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:50.038
learn a whole lot. They take the same route every day and so on. So, when they

00:00:50.038 --> 00:00:53.206
look at the hippocampus of these two groups, brain region involved in learning

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:58.190
and memory. The hippocampus of the cab drivers was a lot more complex and rich,

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.295
and bigger actually, then the bus drivers. So, this is just another great

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:08.020
example then, of how learning really does change the brain.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.376
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm really glad that you mentioned the hippocampus and learning because we're

00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:13.659
actually going to go into talking about the brain structures now. So, thank you

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.080
a lot for giving us that example.
