00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.110
let's revisit specificity and sensitivity, and see how it is calculated.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:12.155
In the language of hypothesis testing we can have the classification problem

00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:18.470
expressed as a hypothesis I or class 1, and a hypothesis II as class 2.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.270
Often one of the hypothesis is called the null hypothesis and

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.620
the other the alternate hypothesis.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.148
In our example, we can say hypothesis I as the person is B,

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:34.600
and hypothesis II as the person is F.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.830
This is the case of a binary classifier.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.980
Now recall, we had two kinds of errors defined.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.680
The type 1 error and the type 2 error.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.550
The type 2 error is the one minus the the specificity.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.630
The model inherently classifies between the two classes or hypothesis.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.760
By making a cut or a threshold.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.890
In this case, let's put the threshold as 1.5.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.710
With this cut, we can

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.900
calculate the area under the probability distribution of both the hypothesis.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.540
If the Type 1 error for given cut or test disket.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.930
For a given hypothesis, is less than a pre-determined value called significance,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.220
which is expressed as a probability of the classifier,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.700
we fail to reject that class.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.110
We also claim that as failing to reject the null hypothesis.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.670
We also define the power of the test as 1

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.650
minus the sensitivity of the type 2 error.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.480
Now notice the sensitivity and

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.420
the specificity is dependent on the threshold or the cut determined here.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.330
If we move this around, the values for sensitivity and specificity.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.320
With change.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.360
You can guess now, that we can draw a curve that

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.840
plots the specificity versus sensitivity for different values of this cut.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.030
Such a curve is called a receiver operator characteristic curve.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.800
In the following video, we will look at an ROC curve for our classifiers.
