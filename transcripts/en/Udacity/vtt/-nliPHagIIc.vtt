00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.484
Now that you understand AVAudioRecorder,

00:00:02.484 --> 00:00:05.300
it's time to get that
code into PitchPerfect.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.373
In Xcode, open up the
RecordSoundsViewController.swift file.

00:00:09.373 --> 00:00:13.349
Let's start by adding in the import
statement for AVFoundation right here,

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.149
underneath where it says import UIKit.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.917
Inside the RecordSoundsViewController
class,

00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:21.626
let's add our variable
to BD AVAudioRecorder.

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:26.240
I'm going to add it hear underneath
IBOutlet and call it AudioRecorder.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.663
Scroll down to the recordAudio function.

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:31.835
In here we're going to add the lines for
creating the audio session, and

00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:35.030
telling AVAudioRecorder
to start recording audio.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.294
You can find all the code I've typed
here directly under this video.

00:00:39.294 --> 00:00:42.488
At this point our code is
able to record the audio and

00:00:42.488 --> 00:00:45.104
save it to the recorded voice .wav file.

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:47.620
What about when we
want to stop recording?

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.620
That is handled when the stop
recording button is pressed.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.190
And you wired up that button to fire
up the function stopRecording in

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.470
the previous lesson.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.970
Let's go there.

00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:01.310
In the stopRecording function, let's add
these three lines to stop the recording.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.540
We'll tell the audio recorder to stop,
and then we'll close out the session.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.615
That's all it takes.

00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:08.590
PitchPerfect is now able
to record your voice.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.440
If you run it and press record,
you'll see the file name and

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.810
path in the debug console.
