The answer might look like public String getFriends. Maybe you came up with a

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.470
different names for this, that's totally cool. The method should return the

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.990
friends in a string. And it's public, because it's part of the public interface

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.270
of the person class. It doesn't take any arguments. GetFriends is an accessor.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.960
Asking about the friends of an object doesn't mutate the object. We're just

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.140
getting access to the information it can provide. Good work helping me to build

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.760
the public interface for the person class. We'll come back and figure out how

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.240
to implement each of these methods later. But for now, back to the professor,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.311
who will talk about implementing the car methods.
