00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.719
Now there are a few other features we'd like to enable for our sound effects.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.943
For example, what if a player enters a menu or switches to another tab? We

00:00:07.943 --> 00:00:11.249
might want to be able to cut out all sound effects immediately in those

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:16.715
circumstances. The way we do that, is by simply disconnecting our main node

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:20.810
from the node graph, creating a new one in its place, and connecting it to our

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.369
output. The new node won't be connected to any of the sound effects the old one

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.686
was, so we can start from a clean slate. For the next assignment, we've

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:36.165
provided this stop all method, for you to implement this functionality. You

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:38.950
should be able to do this in just a couple of lines of code.
