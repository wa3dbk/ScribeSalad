00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.590
Now that we have the corrects substitution to use, we can replace 4m minus 3

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:11.750
with the variable u. So, this part becomes u, and this part becomes u. So,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.004
we'll have 2u squared plus 7u plus 5 equals 0. Now that we have a quadratic

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:22.124
equation to solve, I want you to find the factored expression for the left hand

00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:28.270
side of the equation. And then I want you to solve this equation for u. Be sure

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.320
when you enter your answers here, you enter them as a set.
