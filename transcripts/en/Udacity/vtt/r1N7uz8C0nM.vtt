00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.420
We can also can cross configuration with case based reasoning.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.830
Both configuration and case based reasoning are typically applied to routine

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.690
design problems, problems of the kind that we've often encountered in the past.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.920
Gives a configuration, we start with a prototypical concept,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.110
then assign values to all the variables as we saw in this chair example.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.790
In case of case-based reasoning we start with the design of

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.590
a specific chair that we had designed earlier. Look at its variables and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.505
tweak it as needed to satisfy this constraint so the current problem.

00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:32.590
Case-based reasoning assumes that we already designed our other chairs, and

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.920
we have stored examples of the chairs for designing the memory.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.620
Configuration assumes, that we already designed enough chairs so

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.770
that we can in fact extract the plan. When a specific problem is presented to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.560
an IA agent, the IA agent, if it is going to use the method of configuration,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.450
is going to call upon the plan obstruction hierarchy and then

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.410
start defining plans. If the AI agent uses the method of case based reasoning,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.160
then it'll go into the case memory, retrieve the closest matching case, and

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.540
then start tweaking the case. Little bit later we will see how an AI agent

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.240
select between different methods that were able to address the task. As we

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.320
have mentioned earlier in the course, the chemical periodic table was one of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.060
the really important scientific discoveries. Similar to chemical periodic table,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.480
we are trying to build a periodic table of intelligence.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.080
Unlike the chemical periodic table which deals with balance electrons.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.560
Our periodic table of intelligence, deals with tasks and methods.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.540
In this particular course, we have considered both a large number of tasks,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.716
configuration being one of them, as well as a large number of methods,

00:01:34.716 --> 00:01:37.180
[UNKNOWN] instantiation and case-based reasoning being two of them.
