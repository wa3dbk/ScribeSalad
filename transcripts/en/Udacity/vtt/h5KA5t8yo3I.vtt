00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This question asks us to see whether new code that modifies our web crawler

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
changes the way it behaves, and if so, how does it affect the run time?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
First let's figure out if the new code acts the same way

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or produces the same results as the old code.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Looking just at add<u>to</u>index, we can see that it changes the structure of the index.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In the end we're going to get an index that looks like this.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This means that we might have the same keyword appear multiple times,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but each time it'll appear it'll be with perhaps a different URL.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Looking at the lookup procedure,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
it'll go through the entire index and every time it finds a keyword

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that matches the one it's looking for, it'll pin the URL to a result list.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
In the end, you'll get a list of all the URLs.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In fact, it'll be the same list you would if you used the original add<u>to</u>index

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and lookup procedures.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But now we must ask ourselves, how does this new code affect the run time,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the speed at which add<u>to</u>index and lookup run?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Before, add<u>to</u>index had to go through perhaps the entire index

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
looking for the entry that corresponded to the keyword.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But in this code all it has to do is append the new keyword and URL to the end.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This is faster than searching through the index.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Before, lookup would just go through the index

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
until it found the keyword corresponding to this lookup.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
In the previous case, the lookup would stop as soon as it found the keyword.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But now lookup has to go through the entire index no matter what

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
because it doesn't know how many times the keyword appears,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
whereas before, all it had to do was find the one occurrence of the keyword.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So in the end, all things considered,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the behavior is the same, but add to index runs faster and lookup will run slower.
