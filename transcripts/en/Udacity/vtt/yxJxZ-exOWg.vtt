00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.930
What if I want to rearrange my friends list, based on who I talked to last.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.395
I'll add a method, talkTo, which takes a friend, which, wherever they are on

00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:14.222
the list, will take them, and move them up to the front of the list. There's

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:17.556
one odd situation we would need to think about. What should happen if the given

00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:20.800
person isn't a friend? To decide this, we would need to think about this

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.330
situation we're modeling. Do you add every person you talk to, as a friend?

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.410
That would be pretty cool. We'd all have a lot of friends, but I think that's

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.046
not realistic. So in this case, let's say if you talked to somebody who isn't a

00:00:32.046 --> 00:00:37.014
friend at all yet, nothing changes. How would you implement the talkTo method?
