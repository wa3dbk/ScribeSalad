00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.791
You've seen how many bacteria are left after one hour and after two hours but

00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:07.154
now I would like you to work out how many hours it will be before there are

00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:12.360
fewer than 5 bacteria left. Now, we haven't directly covered this but think

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.810
about different things you could do to get an approximate answer. This zoomed

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.160
in version of our graph might help you or maybe you could try another method.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.849
Also, please round your answer to the nearest hour.
