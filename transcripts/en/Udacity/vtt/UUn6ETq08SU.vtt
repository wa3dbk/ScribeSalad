00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.212
If our sample size is 100, that means we now have 99 degrees of freedom instead

00:00:05.212 --> 00:00:10.387
of 24. And if we look at our T table, we see that the closest degrees of

00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:16.630
freedom to 99 is 100. So we'll just use that one. And again we want .025 in

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.171
each tail. Notice that it also says at the bottom Confidence level C. And here

00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:28.820
we have 95%. This is the same as how at the top of the column, it has .025% in

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.152
either tail. That's equivalent to a 95% confidence interval, pretty cool. And

00:00:35.152 --> 00:00:42.592
we see that the t critical value is 1.984 and negative 1.984. Therefore, the

00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:51.708
margin of error is 1.984 times s, divided by root n. And this is 39.68. Notice

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:55.677
that now the margin of error got a lot smaller than it was before with a sample

00:00:55.677 --> 00:01:03.430
size of 25. Before the margin of error was 2.064 times 200 divided by the

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.410
square root of 25, which was 82.56. So when we increase the sample size, we

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.256
decrease our margin of error, and we're more precise. And remember, when we

00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:21.261
increase the sample size, we also have more degrees of freedom and therefore,

00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:28.323
our t distribution goes from wider to skinnier as it approaches normality.
