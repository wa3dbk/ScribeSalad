00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.920
Hm. You know,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.550
I bet you're curious what the stuff you're learning has to do with real design.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.340
We've talked about affordances and signifiers and a little bit about conceptual

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.750
models. Well, here's some real design. Let's, let's talk about it. See

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.360
this? It's a tape dispenser. And we have the tape [SOUND] something designed

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.200
at the end so it doesn't stick. And the holder, the dispenser and look at

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.400
this. The packaging. The designer has to think

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.410
it all through. It isn't enough to design

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.266
the product. You have to design how

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:41.820
it's mounted, the packaging, instruction manuals, even the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.990
box in which it shipped. That's kind of

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.590
what's exciting about design, it's the whole system.
