00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
Hurray, you're done implementing
wire frames for the app.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.060
Now comes the visual polish part, 
where we tweak the styles

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.430
and the views to make
the app look awesome.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.620
Here's the visual mocks, 
for what the app should look like

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.040
when we're done.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.900
If you work with a designer,
they should also give you redlines.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.360
Redlines specify everything from sizes,
font styles, colors, spacing, etc.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.320
This should help you achieve
pixel perfect layouts

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.450
that match the visual mocks.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.480
How did we come up with these values?

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.150
Well we used the Android design guide

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.119
which has information
on metrics and grids,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.275
and we adapted them
to fit our app's needs.

00:00:35.275 --> 00:00:38.000
