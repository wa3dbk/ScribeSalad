00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The highest derivative here is the first one.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The highest derivative here is the second one.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And here it's the first one again.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So that's the order -- 1, 2 and 1.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The first one isn't a system. It's just a single equation.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The second one either.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The third one is a system -- two equations.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The first one is explicit.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The highest derivative appears on one side alone and nowhere else.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This one is not explicit.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The highest derivative is hidden inside the sine.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Same here. The highest derivative --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
one of the two highest derivatives, I should be saying --

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is hidden, so this one is not explicit either.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This one is linear.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In this case, we have the sine of the function we're looking for.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This is not linear.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And in this case we have the square of the function we're looking for,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which, again, is not linear.
