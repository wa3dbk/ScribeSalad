00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.370
This kind of reflection model is called Toon Shading, or Cel Shading, or

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.770
sometimes Posterization. Toon is short for cartoon. Cel is short for celuloid,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.020
the material for the transparent sheets that are used when animation is drawn

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.178
by hand. There are all sorts of variations for this type of rendering. For

00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:18.673
example, you can change colors based on the shading level and get more

00:00:18.673 --> 00:00:22.164
elaborate effects. In this rendering, a separate image processing shader is

00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:25.790
used to detect the edges of the object, and outline them. This type of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.790
illumination model is one example of what's called Non Photorealistic

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.622
Rendering, or NPR for short. Photorealistic means "looks like a photo." If you

00:00:31.622 --> 00:00:32.630
think about it, there is a nearly infinite number of ways to draw things that

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.634
do not look realistic. The running joke is that we've been doing

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:37.118
non-photorealistic rendering on computers for decades, since realism is hard to

00:00:37.118 --> 00:00:45.806
achieve. The way I see it is that non-photorealistic rendering has an intent

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:51.574
behind it. Just as we assign different fonts to text to convey a different

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:56.785
impression, NPR is a choice we can make about 3D rendering. Scott McCloud and

00:00:56.785 --> 00:00:59.975
his book, Understanding Comics, talks about amplification through

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:03.862
simplification. The idea is that by displaying only the relevant pieces of

00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:07.904
information, you strengthen your message. For example, an automobile owner

00:01:07.904 --> 00:01:12.253
manual usually has simplified drawings instead of photos. Non-photorealistic

00:01:12.253 --> 00:01:17.010
techniques often try to convey information in a more sketchy or artistic way.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.986
For example, a sketchy look can let the viewer know that the result they're

00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:22.930
looking at is in just an early stage of design.
