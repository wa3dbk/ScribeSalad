00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.450
So now, let's talk about how big
the two-level page-table gets.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.400
Say we have a 32-bit address space and
a 4 kilobyte page.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.850
Let's say we're using
a 1024-entry outer page table and

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.860
a 1024 entry inner tables.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.880
There can be many of them,
up to 1024 of them.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.040
And let's say that the page
table entry's 8 bytes.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.900
Assuming that our page table entry is 8
bytes and that we have a program that

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.870
uses virtual memory at the beginning of
memory from addresses 0 through this,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.290
and that the top of the memory
from address this to the end,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.441
let's look at what the flat page table
size will be and what our two-level

00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:45.770
page-table size will be, with this split
between the inner and outer page-tables.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.990
The flat page table size will have
one entry for each possible page.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:58.470
So we have 2 to the 32nd pages,
2 to the 12 bytes in each page.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.600
So we have 2 to the 20th entries.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.350
And the total size will be 8 times this,
which ends up being 8 megabytes.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.950
For the 2-level page table,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.530
we need to figure out how many inner
page tables do we have here and here.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.443
Our address is now composed
of a 12 bit offset,

00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:23.307
to index into the 4 kilobyte page,

00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:28.570
a 10-bit outer page number and
a 10-bit inner page number.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.340
They need to add up to 32,
which they do.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.500
So we know that we need to
have the outer page table, and

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.260
it's size will be 2 to
the 10th entries times 8 bytes

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.950
per entry here, which ends up being
8 kilobytes for the outer page table.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.970
Now the question is, which of these
entries need to point to actual inner

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.560
page tables and which ones can simply
say that there is no inner page table?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.590
To figure that out, we need to see which
of the inner page entries do we need

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.590
to actually point of pages of memory and
which ones can simply be empty.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.550
Thus we will decompose these addresses.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.100
This part of the address
is the page offset.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.670
The upper part is the page number and

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.310
we need to split this 20 bit
page number into 10-bit groups.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.160
So let's just write it out.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.713
We have 0000, these are the two zeros.

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:32.381
Another hex digit for
0, the 1, and the 0.

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:37.460
This is the outer page number,
this is the inner page number.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.880
As you can see,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.050
all of the addresses in this range
have the same outer page number.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.240
We start at 0, we end at 0.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.620
So only the entry number 0 here needs
to point to an actual inner page table.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.170
For this address range, the page
number goes from FFFF0 to FFFFF.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.330
These page numbers also have
the same outer page number.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.890
It's all 1s.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.460
So only the last outer page table entry

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.230
needs to point to
an actual inner page table.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.990
Note that there
are a 1,024 entries here,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.880
only 2 of which point
to inner page tables.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.310
So, there is a 1,022 entries
that simply say nothing.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.530
So we have 2 inner page table times,
what's the size of one of them?

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.810
Well the size is 1024 entries
times 8 bytes per entry,

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.740
which gives us a total of 16 kilobytes.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.310
Adding the size of the outer page table,
we get only 24 kilobytes.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.970
So the size of a 2-level page table for
this application is

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.340
only 24 kilobytes compared to 8
megabytes for the flat page table.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.320
And this is why multilevel page-tables
are almost exclusively using today's

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.740
processors especially when we have a 64
bit address space, because for a 64

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.755
address space, the flat page table size
would be too large to fit in memory.

00:04:08.775 --> 00:04:12.985
But the multi level table will
fit mostly because the outer

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:16.144
most page table will
have many empty entries.

00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:19.084
So we will need very few
of these inner page tables.
