00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.302
So this question's a little trickier than it seems, because we need to make it

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:08.082
so if the two dates are the same, we should really get the result 0, not the

00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:12.618
exception. So the solution is to use a not and switch the order of the dates, so

00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:17.415
we're going to assert that the second date is not before the first date, which

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:20.986
is exactly what the requirement is here. So, now we've added the assertion. When

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:25.195
we run this, instead of getting the value 0, we get an assertion error like

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:29.178
this. Not a really friendly error message, for a regular user, but for a

00:00:29.178 --> 00:00:33.036
programmer this should help us a lot. It points us to the line in the code where

00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:36.273
the assertion failed and can look at that and understand what went wrong.
