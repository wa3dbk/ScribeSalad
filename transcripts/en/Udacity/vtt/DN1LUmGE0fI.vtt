00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
To show that equivalence is undecidable, we should first start out with a program

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.140
for which we want to decide the halting problem, and that should be P.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.660
We start out with the step here, and then we add a second program and that program is called P‘

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.710
and it goes into an infinite loop.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.060
No matter what input, this program is just programmed to always go into an infinite loop.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.310
Once we have those two programs P and P‘, we run them through the algorithm

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.000
that decides equivalence and what that will do is it will basically ask--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.090
does the program P for which we want to decide the halting problem do the same thing

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.630
as the program that always goes into an infinite loop.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.860
And then, of course, that means if the two programs are indeed equivalent,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.770
then P will also go into an infinite loop because all that P‘ is doing is it always goes into an infinite loop

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.080
and we don't even need the other two building blocks because we have now shown

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.120
that you can use equivalence to solve the halting problem.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.080
You just compare any program for which you want to decide the halting problem to a program

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.990
that always goes into an infinite loop and if they do the same thing, then they are equivalent.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.280
So you know that P will not halt, and if they are equivalent, well then P halts.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.250
Now, this was certainly one of the tougher quizzes in this course so congratulations for figuring it out,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.490
but of course I also trust that by now you have learned the ropes of theoretical computer science.

00:01:16.490 --> 99:59:59.000
You revert here is that I will give you a third proof of undecidability for free.
