00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.822
The result is the additive increase multiplicative

00:00:03.822 --> 00:00:08.340
decrease congestion control algorithm. The algorithm is

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.280
distributed, meaning that all the senders can

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.340
act independently, and we've just shown using

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.000
the phase plots that it's both fair

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.310
and efficient. To visualize this sending rate

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.641
over time, the sender's sending rate looks roughly as shown. We call this the

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:28.251
TCP sawtooth behavior or simply the

00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:33.180
TCP sawtooth. TCP periodically probes for available

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.280
bandwidth by increasing its rate using additive

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.360
increase. When the sender reaches a saturation

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.540
point by filling up a buffer in a router somewhere along the path, it will see

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.720
a packet loss, at which point it will decrease its sending rate

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.380
by half. You can thus see that a TCP sender sends, a sending rate shown by the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.410
dotted green line that is halfway between the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.270
maximum window size at which the sender sends, and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.158
half that rate, which it backs off to when it sees a loss. You can see that

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:13.798
between the lowest sending rate and the highest

00:01:13.798 --> 00:01:17.450
is w m over 2 plus 1 round trips.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.120
Now given that rate we can compute the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.720
number of packets between periods of packet loss,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.100
and compute the loss rate from this. The

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.270
number of packets sent for every packet lost is

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.080
the area of this triangle. So the lost rate is on the order of the square

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.920
of the maximum window divided by some constant.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.570
Now, the throughput is the average rate, 3 4ths

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.120
w max divided by the RTT. Now if we want to relate the throughput to the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.430
loss rate, where we call the loss rate

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.700
p, and the throughput lambda, we simply need to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.200
solve for w m. And I'm just going to get rid of the constant. So a loss

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.700
occurs once for this number of packets, so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.580
the loss rate is simply 1 over that quantity.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.890
And then when we solve for w m and plug in for throughput, we see that the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.080
throughput is inversely proportional to both the round trip

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.700
time and the square root of the loss rate.
