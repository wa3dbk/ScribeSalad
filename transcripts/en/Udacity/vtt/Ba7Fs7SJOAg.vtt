00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.134
When you look at the code of the tester, there's something that's a little bit

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:09.490
subtle. The largest method takes an array of measurable. Over here it returns a

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.294
measurable, and I'm printing it here by adding it to the print statement. That

00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:20.430
only works because the Car class has a two-string method. That can convert a

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.386
Car to a string. And it's a bit of a trick, the same thing won't work, for,

00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:30.628
computing the largest Country in a set of countries. Let's try that. Here, I'm

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:35.946
computing, the largest Country of a set of countries. And now, let's run the

00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:42.556
program. and it prints the largest Country as some gibberish that's just what a

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:47.125
string does by default on an object. And really what we want is we want the

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:51.473
result of this call as a Country. We know it has to be a Country its one of the

00:00:51.473 --> 00:00:55.064
countries that came in so we want this to be a Country and not a measurable and

00:00:55.064 --> 00:01:01.492
here we want to be able to call The getName method on it. Now when you compile

00:01:01.492 --> 00:01:06.118
this, of course it doesn't work. We are told the types are incompatible. As a

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:10.060
simple fix, go ahead and make that fit, and get this program to run.
