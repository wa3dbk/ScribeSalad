Here's a challenge question. Divide a number by 6 and then increase the amount

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:08.597
by 1 8th. The result is 1 4th. Do you think you can find the original number?

00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:12.646
Try your best. And I'm not going to post the solution for this one. So, work

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:14.884
with others in the forum or with a friend.
