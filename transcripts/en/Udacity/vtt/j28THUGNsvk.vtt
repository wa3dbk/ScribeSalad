00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.399
The constant term is going to be 48. And we can actually get this really

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.310
quickly. Let's think about how. We can start to simplify this by multiplying

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.588
out the first two sets of parentheses. If we do this, then the first expression

00:00:11.588 --> 00:00:16.370
we have is going to be x squared minus 4 x minus 12. And then this, of course,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.515
is still multiplied by x minus 4. Now to further simplify this, we know that we

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:22.260
have to multiply every term in this first set of parentheses by each of the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.744
terms over here. So let's think carefully about this for a moment. If we

00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:29.804
multiply anything over here by x squared, it's going to have a factor of x

00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:33.856
squared in it. So that's not going to give us a constant. The same is true if

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:37.600
we multiply anything by negative 4x, since there are no terms over here that

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.528
would cancel out that x. Now if instead, we multiply something over here by

00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:46.300
negative 12, we do have the potential to come up with a constant term. If we

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.977
multiply negative 12 times x, well, that's going to give us negative 12x. That

00:00:49.977 --> 00:00:53.300
won't work. It has an x in it. So the last combination of terms is what's going

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.174
to give us the answer we're looking for, a constant. Negative 12 times negative

00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:02.640
4 gives us 48. And remember, this negative 12 came from multiplying the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.215
constants in the first 2 expressions that we multiplied together. So the real

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:09.350
way we get 48 is by multiplying all of the constants involved in these

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.875
expressions in the original factored form. Negative 6 times 2 times negative 4

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:16.918
is what gives us 48.
