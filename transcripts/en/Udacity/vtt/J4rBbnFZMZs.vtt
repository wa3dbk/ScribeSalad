00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.043
Now that we've factored, I'm interested in, how this factoring splits up our

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:08.260
number line. So were going to work toward completing this table. And I'ld like

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.484
you to start off by telling me what intervals, this splits our number line into,

00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:17.022
and then also write in the critical values of x right here. At which the splits

00:00:17.022 --> 00:00:21.939
happen. For the purposes of defining these intervals in values of x, don't

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.507
include these two endpoints inside these intervals.
