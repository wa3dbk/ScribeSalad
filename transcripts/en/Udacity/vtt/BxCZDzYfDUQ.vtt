00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.180
Next, we're going to speak with Dr.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.160
Josh Mandel who earned a B.S.
in Computer Science at MIT and an M.D.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.100
degree at Tufts University School
of Medicine.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.320
Currently, he's Chief Architect for
the Smart Platform Project

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.110
at the Boston Children's Hospital and
Harvard Medical School.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.330
So Josh, I really appreciate you taking
the time to be with the students today.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.840
I sometimes think of you
as a younger version of me.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.950
So could you tell the students
a little bit about your background?

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.610
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.640
Well these days the main hat that
I'm wearing is I'm the architect for

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.970
a project called Smart Platforms
at Boston Children's Hospital,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.130
Harvard Medical School.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.410
But I have a background
in computer science and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.750
did undergrad in
computer science at MIT.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.800
I spent a little bit of time working
at a biotech startup in Cambridge,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.710
Mass doing gene synthesis and
laboratory automation.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.830
And I want to medical school at Tufts.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.670
I graduated in 2010 and
realized I was having

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.620
a lot of fun trying to fix
thecomputer systems in hospitals and

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.039
clinics and I've been working hard since
then in the health informatics space.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.180
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.040
You've been involved I guess since
the beginning with the SHARP Project at

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.280
Harvard Children's Hospital.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.560
Could you tell us
a little bit about that?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.710
Sure.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.520
So back in 2009, early 2010, the Office
of the National Coordinator for

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.860
Health IT Sponsored four research
projects or put out proposals for

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.910
four research projects.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.820
One in the area of security,
one in the area of data normalization,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.810
one in the area of cognitive aspects
of using EHRs and one in the area of

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.260
building app platforms on top of
electronic health record systems.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.910
And that last one is a project called
SMART that I've been working on

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.690
at Harvard since 2010.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.930
And it's all about trying to build
app platforms so that doctors and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.000
patients and healthcare practitioners
can use the applications that they want

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.260
to to interact with health data.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.420
The idea was, we've got iPhones
in our civilian lives and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.170
Android phones that let us use
whatever apps that we want.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.330
And wouldn't it be nice in health care
if we could bring the app that we wanted

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.690
to the table to work
with patient record data.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.280
&gt;&gt; This idea of app platforms
is something that a number of

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.090
people are interested in.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.780
Tell us why you feel it's important and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.870
what approach did Harvard
take to developing one.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we have a lot of health care
data, some of which patients bring to

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.890
the table, some of which are measured
in a traditional clinical setting.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.890
And those data live inside of a variety
of different databases inside of

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.590
hospital and clinics.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.180
And, when it comes to making sense of
an entire patient, to make a decision,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.010
to figure out a diagnosis, to decide
on a kind of treatment, it's extremely

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.980
helpful to be able to bring those
data together in one place and

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.150
to use specific tools that
help to do a specific job.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.940
So, this is something that we're pretty
used to in terms of an app platform on

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.520
the phone, or you might use a specific
tool just to manage your calendar and

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.690
a different tool to
manage your to do list.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.220
And if there's a better calendar
application that comes along, or

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.340
a better to do list that comes along,
you can trade information with

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.690
your friends and
find the best one that works for you.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.330
And we'd like to be able to do the same
thing with the way that we make

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.520
a diagnosis, or make a treatment for
a diabetic patient,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.270
or engage in communicating with
patients in a clinical setting.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.120
We'd like to be able to encourage
app developers to build

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.060
the best tools to do these
small kinds of jobs and

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.448
give end users the freedom to pick
the tools that really work for them.

00:03:22.448 --> 00:03:24.630
So there have been a number of
approaches to these kinds of

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.110
app platform development and what
we're doing at Harvard and with smart

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.500
platforms is to build an open set of
specifications built on open standards

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.520
that anyone can implement without any
proprietary technology in the stacks.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.134
So we want to make sure that all the
specifications we build are out there on

00:03:40.134 --> 00:03:41.960
the web for people to build on top of.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.840
&gt;&gt; Well along came HIMSS 2014.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.270
And I ran into you there.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.660
And to my surprise and delight you
were showing a new version of SMART.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.340
Can you tell us about that?

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.970
&gt;&gt; Sure.
So

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.570
we were very excited coming into
the HIMSS conference which is

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.280
the Health Information Management
Systems Society conference in Orlando

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.200
this past February where we were able to
get three or four different EHR vendors

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.170
that come together and implement
support for the same set of apps.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.740
So we had some apps that we had built
ourselves on the SMART platforms team

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.430
and other apps that had been built by
independent application developers.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.120
And we were able to get this same
package of apps running on top of

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.180
a commercial EHR system from a company
called Cerner on top of an open source

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.170
electronic health record called Vista,
which this instance of Vista

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.360
was maintained by Hewlett-Packard
in their government innovation lab.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.144
We were also able to show these same
apps running on top of a system called

00:04:40.144 --> 00:04:43.630
Help2 that runs at Intermountain
Healthcare in Salt Lake City.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.343
So it was a really exciting time
because we were able to take some new,

00:04:47.343 --> 00:04:50.226
emerging standards from HL7
which is the healthcare

00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:53.237
standards development organization and
build this app

00:04:53.237 --> 00:04:56.567
platform on top of an open set of
standards that EHR vendors and

00:04:56.567 --> 00:05:00.476
large healthcare providers
organizations, and Hewlett-Packard and

00:05:00.476 --> 00:05:04.410
government innovation lab,
were all able to integrate consistently.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.790
&gt;&gt; And more specifically,
that new standard was FHIR.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.100
&gt;&gt; So yes, we've been doing a lot
of work recently with FHIR,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.840
Fast Healthcare Interoperability
Resources which provide a couple of

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.580
key building blocks when you're thinking
about building a health app platform.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.330
And so the first important
building block that FHIR

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.650
provides is a set of
clinical data models.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.970
So how do you write down a medication or
an allergy or a problem or

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.620
a lab result or
a set of patient demographics?

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.420
And FHIR provides detailed data models,
which are called resources for

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.900
each of those things.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.120
And the second building block
that FHIR provides is an API,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.120
an application programming interface.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.270
And this is one that's built on ADTP and
REST, that let's you query for

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.480
the specific kinds of discrete data
elements that you're interested in.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.240
So if you're trying to build
a lab Data viewing app

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.055
you can write a restful query or
pull back the lab results that

00:05:55.055 --> 00:05:58.455
you're interested in from a system
that implements this FHIR API.

00:05:58.455 --> 00:06:01.470
So FHIR has been a really
important building block for

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.040
the current version of SMART which
is entirely based on open standards.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.880
&gt;&gt; Well can you show us a little bit?

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.235
&gt;&gt; Yeah I would be delighted
to show you what the SMART and

00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:11.910
FHIR platform looks like.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.560
So, I mentioned that Smart is a platform
where third party app developer's

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.860
can build apps that hook into EHR's.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.572
And I'm going to start off by
showing you, not a real EHR, but

00:06:20.572 --> 00:06:23.410
kind of the demo sandbox system
that we host at Harvard.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.108
So, we won't be looking at
any real patient data, but

00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:29.135
you'll see a set of synthetic and
anonymized patient data.

00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:33.500
And anybody who wants to try this at
home can go to fhir.smartplatforms.org

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.900
and create an account and

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.300
go through the same app and the same
demo that I'll be showing you here.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.940
But this fake EHR that I'll start out
with just does two very simple jobs.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.560
It let's you find a patient.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.640
And then it let's you run another app.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.130
So I'll show you an example
of a growth charts app

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.540
that we built at
Boston Children's Hospital.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.410
And I'm going to pick
a pediatric record here.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.120
I'm going to search for
a patient called Amy Lee.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.330
And I'm going to open this
record in the Growth Charts App.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.534
And what we'll see when this
launches is two different views of

00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:05.490
a patient's growth history.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.720
We decided it was really important to
build apps that made sense not just for

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.840
clinicians but for patients as well.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.122
So we won't get deep into
the features of this app.

00:07:13.122 --> 00:07:15.870
But I'll point out at a really high
level this app is able to fetch the data

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.260
that it needs from the SMART EHR
that's running on the other end.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.800
And when it gets those data, it's able
to plot the traditional kinds of growth

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.880
curves that you see on
a paper growth chart.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.480
So the initial view that we'll see here
will show me the child's length or

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.170
height, as well as their weight.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.590
And we can see how it's
been tracking over time.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.420
And this is an app that built
entirely using HTML and JavaScript.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.340
It runs entirely client side in the web
browser, so the only server side

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.330
component of this app is just a static
web server that hosts this HTML and

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.650
JavaScript, and the app itself is
all just running in the browser.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.700
So this is a traditional kind of
clinician-facing view that let's me see

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.190
how growth has been tracking in
terms of percentiles over time.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.300
But also built into this app
is a communication tool,

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.740
so we can have a conversation
with parents as well

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.860
that highlights a few of the key
aspects of a child's growth.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.350
So in this example we see this is
a patient with a healthy weight, and so

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.510
rather than getting bogged down in a lot
of curves and numbers that are changing

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:16.330
over time, the real essential message
for a conversation with Amy's parents

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.820
here might be that Amy has a healthy
weight for her height and for her age.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.880
And we can see that her weight has
been trending in a healthy fashion

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.530
since her last visit.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.390
So this an app that we built.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.890
It's available open source, so
anybody can take the code for

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.980
this application and run it, or
extend it to fit their needs.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.730
And it's an application that you're
seeing here running against what

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:43.159
we call our sandbox server with 50 or
60 sample patients of data.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.710
&gt;&gt; And I believe the app is
called Growth-Tastic!, just so

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.150
the students have the name.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, the official name is it's
the SMART Pediatric Growth Chart App,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.480
but when we want to sound jazzy about
it, we'll call it Growth-Tastic!

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.160
And if it's interesting, Mark,
I could show you a little bit about what

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.730
the data looked like under
the hood when this app runs.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.210
&gt;&gt; I think it'd be great.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:06.070
&gt;&gt; Okay, so let me actually open up
the Chrome developer tools here and

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.880
show you what happens when
we load this app again.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.660
So what I want to show you is,
as this app loads,

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.160
the set of API calls that it makes in
order to get data from the smart EHR.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.633
We won't talk about the details of
authorization on authentication right

00:09:20.633 --> 00:09:24.964
now but I'll just say that under the
hood the app is getting access tokens

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:28.090
that it needs to fetch
clinical data using oloft2.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.520
But once it's got those access tokens
it's able to make a couple of very

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.560
simple API calls in order
to fetch clinical data.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.330
The first one here is a call
to get patient demographics.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:44.340
And so the call itself is just
/patient/880378, which the patient

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.980
ID in this case, and what we get back
is a FHIR response which is a JSON

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.965
representation of patient demographics
which has the patient's name,

00:09:52.965 --> 00:09:57.185
the patient's birthdate, medical
record numbers, other identifiers.

00:09:57.185 --> 00:10:00.485
And we can see just at a glance, this
is the kind of payload that a developer

00:10:00.485 --> 00:10:03.215
could look at, inspect and
make sense of pretty quickly.

00:10:03.215 --> 00:10:07.182
And if there are any fields that you
didn't understand the FHIR specification

00:10:07.182 --> 00:10:11.542
which is hosted on the web defines each
one of these fields in great detail.

00:10:11.542 --> 00:10:13.432
So that's what the patient
demographics look like.

00:10:13.432 --> 00:10:14.860
And I'll show you just one more example.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.842
This app only needs to make one other
API call which is to fetch vital signs.

00:10:19.842 --> 00:10:22.990
So heights and weights and
body mass indexes.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.340
And in fHIR all those things
are called observations.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.290
So the app is able to fetch just
the observations that it needs

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.290
about a patient's growth over time.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.620
And I'll give you just a really quick
look at what those observations look

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.540
like when they come over the wire.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.930
So we're looking right now at the FHIR
JSON representation of an observation.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.870
And in this case it's a body
mass index observation.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.660
And we can see that this is a quantity
of 16.9 kilograms per meter squared.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.800
And it was taken in 2008.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.560
So again, this is the JSON
representation of a set of FHIR data.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.400
And this is over the wire the kind of
raw information that's fueling this app.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.590
Once the app fetches
patient demographics and

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:03.090
a set of these observations
from the EHR, it's able to draw

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.500
the visualization that you see here on
this screen based just on those data.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.210
&gt;&gt; Josh, I know in addition
to what you've shown us,

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.940
you're interested in the idea that
many people refer to as Pull.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:20.404
Can you talk a bit about how
you're using other technologies to

00:11:20.404 --> 00:11:24.450
enable patients to effectively
subscribe to receive their own data.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.160
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.390
So the work that I've been doing with
my SMART platform architect hat on

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.520
has been really focused on
building tools that let

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.960
clinicians launch an app from
an electronic health record system or

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.980
that let patients launch an app from
inside of a patient portal online.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.480
But I've also been
very involved with some

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.460
efforts at the level of federal
work groups to define standards and

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.080
specifications that let patients
access their own data online.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.970
So right now in 2014 as part
of meaningful use stage two

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.390
patients have the ability to view their
data online through a patient portal,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:03.820
and to download it and to transmit it
to a third party app that they choose.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.250
And typically the way that transmission
happens is through something called

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:13.210
Push Messaging or the Direct Project,
which works like secure email.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.200
I've been very interested in
trying to define standards for

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.830
a different kind of mechanism for
apps to access data.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.880
So instead of basically emailing your
data to the app, we can have a web API

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.750
where apps ask for data and patients can
authorize access to those data or not.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.350
And so we've defined a set
of specifications called

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:35.740
the Blue Button REST API that have
enabled anyone with health data, so

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:41.470
an EHR vendor or a healthcare provider
organization, to expose patient data for

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.440
patients who want to authorize
access to third party applications.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.890
It's a very similar set of technology
to what we've been doing with SMART.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.990
But a different set of use cases and
a different set of end users.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.940
&gt;&gt; This is great.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.940
I want the students to reflect back on
the interview with Doug Fridsma much

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.980
earlier in the course,
when he talked about the idea of using

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:08.150
Internet to move health IT into
a new era of interoperability.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.170
And I think that, Josh,

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:15.090
you've just shown us a real live
example of doing just that.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.750
And I really appreciate your
taking the time to do it.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:21.630
I hope this is something the students
find exciting and maybe some of them

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:26.260
will decide to do what you and
I did and actually go into this field.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.270
Thank you again.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.280
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much, Mark.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.030
It's been my pleasure.
