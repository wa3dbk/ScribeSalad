00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.310
Great, we understand the data model or
managed object model.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.380
Now on to the rest of these.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.160
It's important to remember
that these seven classes

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.140
always work together as a team
called the CoreDataStack.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.630
As such, it's very useful to treat them
as a team as opposed to individuals.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.040
We can therefore keep
the whole team in one class,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.690
oddly enough called CoreDataStack.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.610
Even though in our day to day,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.170
we will use this class without
thinking too much about what's inside,

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.530
it's worth taking a look at
the code to see what makes it tick.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.660
Note that this class is pretty much
what Apple provides you with, so

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.010
don't feel bad for using it as is.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.280
It's the boilerplate class from
the Apple developers' site on CoreData.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.970
Let's start with the initializer,
it's job is as follows.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.000
It reads a model file, and
this is the extension of the model

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.840
file once it has been
compiled by X code, momd.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.120
Then it creates a sqlite store for
it inside the documents folder.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.420
And it will call it model.sqlite.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.370
Once it's done,
it initializes a context and

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.530
connects all these necessary parts
into a persistent store coordinator.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.860
The coordinator will
also perform migrations.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.760
That's something that
we'll deal with later.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.240
And if everything goes okay,
we get no errors.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.440
We exit, and we have all the core
data stack ready to work.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.090
There are several utility
methods that are available here,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.330
so just drop all data.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.310
This will delete all the objects
inside of your sqlite store.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.450
But it won't delete the files,
so it just empties the tables.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.780
This is useful while you're developing.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.900
And we also have
the save context method,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.320
which builds on top of the method save
from the context in the following way.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.420
Whenever you call save context,
it will first check if there is any

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.960
changes that have to be
saved,and then will save.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.890
So this will make our stack
a little bit more performing.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.830
There are other features that we will
need such as migrating data models or

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.640
implementing an auto save.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.090
We'll add them along the way
when they become necessary.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.800
Let's get started.
