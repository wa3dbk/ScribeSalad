00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And the answer here is no, we cannot.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And the reason is as follows; so when we simulate nondeterminism

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
on a deterministic RAM, what we have is here--a polynomial--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and here we have 2 to the power of that polynomial,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.500
which essentially was needed for trying all possibilities for using the "if better" function

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
or nondeterminism, if you will.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now if we tried the same thing over here, what we would have--we would have

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.500
a nondeterministic machine that runs in     2^p(n) time.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
Now if you wanted to simulate this on a deterministic RAM,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
what you could have in the worst case is a running time of 2 ^2^p(n),

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
which does not fall into this category here anymore because we said that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
exponential time was 2^p(n) and not 2 to the power of some exponential function of n.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So you must not make the mistake that simply because we can simulate NP

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in exponential time, we can also simulate

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
nondeterministic exponential time in exponential time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But given how bad these running times here are, you will, of course,

00:01:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
not come across them very often in practice.
