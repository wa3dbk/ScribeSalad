00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.620
Welcome to this practice session.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.960
In the session we're going to
apply what we've learned so

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.880
far by modifying a battleship
style game called Pirate Fleet.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.540
By the end of this session, we'll create
code that will make custom pirate ships,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.270
launch cannonballs, and
ultimately make a playable game.
