00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.480
Now I know we're in
the technology age but

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.885
I don't want you to forget about
offline groups and events.

00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:10.220
They're great ways to expand your user
base and to improve your branding or

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.810
if you do it right, generate some PR.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.560
As for industry events, you can have
a booth at a relevant conference.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.380
You could be active in meetups.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.240
You could even host relevant events.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.980
Now, if you have the resources,
hosting events is a great thing for

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.410
a few different reasons.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.140
One, it can help you attract
talent to join your team.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.300
Or it can help you find writers
to feature you in an article.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.390
If you're a business to business or
B2B company, hosting events in a topic

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.370
that attracts your potential customers
is also a great way to gain users.
