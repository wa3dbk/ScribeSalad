00:00:00.851 --> 00:00:10.851
[SOUND].

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:30.258
Hey there, I'm Matt. One of the instructors from the

00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:33.226
course Tales from the Genome. I'm really excited that you

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:35.445
logged on to learn with us. What do you say

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:39.143
we get this genetics party started? You mind loading the course?

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:45.152
[SOUND].

00:00:45.152 --> 00:00:47.279
Welcome to Tales from the Genome. And

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:50.503
adventure in DNA, identity, and health. I'm Matt.

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:51.668
&gt;&gt; And I'm Lauren.

00:00:51.668 --> 00:00:54.159
&gt;&gt; And together, we'll be your genome guides. Now, I have my PhD

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.037
in cell and molecular biology and I'll be your main instructor for this course.

00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:01.590
&gt;&gt; And I have my Masters degree in experimental psychology. Matt approached

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.860
me to help him teach this class because I know a little bit

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.980
about genetics through psychology, but I

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.510
always want to learn more, and I thought

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.590
this was a great opportunity for me to learn about my own genome.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.900
And help you learn about yours.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.240
&gt;&gt; This course should be accessible to anyone of almost

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.090
any age or any knowledge base. If you're still in high

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.060
school, or even if you already have a graduate degree. If

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.570
you find yourself taken a lesson, and the information in it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.600
is a little too basic for you, feel free to

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.480
jump ahead or skip around. You can use the syllabus to

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.230
find out which portions are most relevant to you as a

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.110
good starting point. Together we'll discover the secrets of your genome.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.970
&gt;&gt; And,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.810
reveal a new perspective of what it means to be human.
