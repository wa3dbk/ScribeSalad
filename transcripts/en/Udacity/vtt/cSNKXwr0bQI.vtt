00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:08.495
For f of x equals 2. Our region is x is less than negative 2. The next part of

00:00:08.495 --> 00:00:12.330
the graph is our f of x equals x squared, and that is between the region of

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.360
negative 2 and 2. And it's inclusive of that region as you can see by the less

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.790
than or equal to signs. The third part is, f of x is equal to x plus 2 for all

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.003
values greater than 2.
