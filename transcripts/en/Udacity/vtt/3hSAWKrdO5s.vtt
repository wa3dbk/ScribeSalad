A researcher finds that students who listen to classical music in elementary

00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:09.651
school tend to have better grades in high school. There was no random assignment

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:14.557
to conditions or manipulation of an independent variable. In other words, they

00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:19.285
didn't just look at a bunch of random students. We might not even know which

00:00:19.297 --> 00:00:24.095
students they looked at. But then the researcher recommends that children should

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:28.515
listen to classical music, because that will cause them to perform better in

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:32.195
school. What's wrong with this logic? Select all that apply.
