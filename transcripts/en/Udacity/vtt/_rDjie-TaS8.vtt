00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.800
Okay, we're in the home stretch here. Let's figure out

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.630
how to build the HTTP request such that we can

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.090
pass all seven of these form elements. Now, the question

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.610
is where do these elements come from? In most cases

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.200
when you see form elements showing up that aren't obviously

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.930
part of the form itself, and by that I mean

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.260
aren't part of the user interface. Now what's gotta be

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.180
going on here is that we have hidden form elements.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.840
So, let's figure out where they're at. So, here's the start

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.020
of the form. If, we look down through, I don't obviously

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.830
see any other elements. So, I bet it's in some of

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.530
this stuff that's zipped up here. So, let's take a look.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.910
And, sure enough, right here we find three hidden form elements.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.480
So, now we've accounted for six of the seven elements we've

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.940
got to pass along, the Carrier, the Airport, the Submit button

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.370
and then these three. And we can see that right here,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.155
Viewstate okay, is one of those with a very long value. If I open this up, I see

00:00:58.155 --> 00:01:01.349
that here we have one of those other values.

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:04.169
The other one in fact, that makes scrolling through all

00:01:04.169 --> 00:01:06.029
the form data in the network tab such a

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:09.820
long and tedious process. Okay, so now we've identified

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.940
where all seven of the form fields are. The

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.000
question then becomes, how do we build our HTTP requests,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.570
such that this data is included? Because that's really

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.070
what we have to do here. In addition to the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.490
Carrier, the Airport, and the Submit button, we've gotta

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.550
send these along as well. So in this exercise what

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.350
I'd like you to do is write some code

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.660
here that uses the Beautiful Soup Module, and assigns values

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.160
to Event Validation and View State such that they

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.182
have the correct values. The values that this data source

00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:46.320
is expecting to see come across. In a little bit, we'll talk about why

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.560
these values are necessary. For right now,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.820
let's just focus on building the request properly.
