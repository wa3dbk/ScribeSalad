Now if you struggled with this problem, you probably had a problem with your

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:06.810
fixation. You couldn't break out of the mindset and look at it from a new

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.323
perspective, so thinking outside of the box. And for this one, it'd be

00:00:10.323 --> 00:00:13.805
functional fixedness. For this one you probably didn't think pliers could be

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:16.550
used as a weight for the rope to swing it over so you could grab it and tie the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.358
two ropes together. So this concludes my portion of the lesson. I'm going to

00:00:21.358 --> 00:00:23.900
send you back to Greg so he can give you the wrap up on the whole intelligence

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.060
lesson.
