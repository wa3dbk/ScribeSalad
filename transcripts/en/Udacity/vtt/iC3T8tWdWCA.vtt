00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.040
So let's step back a moment and look at
these results for these two extremes.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.920
So we have this one extreme where we bet
all 1,000 chips on a single coin flip

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.290
and another where we bet 1 chip
on each of a 1,000 coin flips.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.930
Now the risk adjusted reward or
the sharp ratio for

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.050
the single that was 0.63,
in other words if we bet

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.830
all 1000 chips on a single flip of
the coin our sharp ratio is 0.63.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.650
So let's call this SRsingle,
now the sharp ratio if we bet

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.200
1000 times in other words 1 chip on
each of 1000 tables turns out to be 20.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.590
So what's the relationship
between the two?

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.520
Of course, 20 is about 40
times bigger than 0.63, but

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.590
there's something more
interesting there.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.960
And it turns out that it's this.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.700
So if we take the single bet case and
multiply it by the square root of 1,000,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.320
we get the sharp ratio of our multi-bet
scenario where we bet 1000 at once.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.230
So isn't that curious?

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.100
So it turns out that in general,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.760
if you carry that scenario out
to more examples, that if you

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.560
split your bets evenly across multiple
tables, this relationship will hold.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.900
In other words, the sharp ratio for
the single bet,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.420
1000 chips on one table,
is our base case.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.170
And as we spread it out over more and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.770
more tables, the sharp ratio improves by
the square root of that number of bets.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.600
And this relation is exactly

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.260
like the fundamental law of
active portfolio management.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.540
Namely, our overall performance
is related to the skill,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.950
in the case of making a single pick,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.010
times the square root of the number
of picks that we're able to make.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.070
So our coin flip casino
has helped to show us

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.210
How we can derive an equation
like this for betting,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.760
which is what buying [LAUGH]
stocks really is, and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.200
to show that you can improve things
either by having more skill,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.990
In case of coin flips,
skill is how biased is the coin.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.690
In the case of investing,

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.020
it's how good are you at predicting
the future return of the stock.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.560
Or you can improve your performance
by increasing your breadth, but

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.270
you only get to improve it by
the square root of your breadth.
