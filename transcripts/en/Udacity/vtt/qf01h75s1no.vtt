00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.570
One solution to this problem of the scarcity of IP

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.510
addresses is Network Address Translation. This also helps mobile devices quickly

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.170
join and exit Local Area Networks, or LANs, as would happen

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.450
as you walk by a row of restaurants and coffee shops

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.140
with your phone. To be concrete and simple, let's suppose

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.390
that you have a combined modem/router connected to the internet in

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.450
your home. Now within your home, you can create a private

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.690
IP network using the network ID reserved for such a situation.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.556
Specifically anything that starts with

00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:33.909
192.168. Typically, the modem/router will allocate

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:39.840
IPs through a protocol called, Dynamic Host Configuration or DHCP. Let's

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.690
say that your computer gets the address 192.168.1.100, and your printer

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.760
gets 192.168.1.101. Your neighbor might also have a local area network with

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.090
a private IP address space, and maybe his printer and

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.990
computer get the same addresses. This turns out to be

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.060
okay. Remember that the network layer is dependent on the

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.019
link layer and everything ultimately get sent through the link

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.050
layer protocol. So, let's say that your computer knows the

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.010
IP address of the printer but not it's MAC address.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.700
To find it the computer broadcasts an address resolution protocol

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.900
or ARP package to the whole linked network asking who

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.293
has the IP address 192.168.1.101. The printer will respond with

00:01:22.293 --> 00:01:25.290
its MAC address and then we're good to go. Because

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.600
the ARP is sent by broadcast over the link layer

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.270
network, it never exits your private network in your home.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.830
So there's no possibility of your pictures ending up on

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.770
your neighbor's printer or some such embarrassing circumstance. Of course,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.290
you want to be able to do more than just

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.940
connect to other things around the house. You want to

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.600
be able to connect to cool web sites like Udacity.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.090
let's connect your modem to your internet and give it the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.740
IP 98.251.119.249. When you ask your computer to send a packet

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.000
to Udacity's IP, your computer will not find the matching IP

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.260
in it's routing table. So, it will send the packet to

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.250
the default gateway, in this case your router. The router will

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.230
also not find the IP in its table. It will really

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.960
only know about the private IPs. And so it will forward

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.240
the packet onto its default gateway on the wide area

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.070
network, the internet. As a parenthetical note here I should say

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.740
that packet is a term we use, the network layer, for

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.390
discrete chunks of data that get passed around. Eventually the packet

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.930
will reach the Udacity site. But it's not clear how

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.260
Udacity should send the information back. It can't use the local

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.940
IP address because there's no way to tell whether it should

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.350
send information to your computer or to your neighbor's. So instead,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.220
your router actually swaps out your IP address for

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.970
its own. This way, Udacity can just swap the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.850
source and IP addresses and then send that packet

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.860
back along with the data. The modem then just needs

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.810
to change the destination IP back to your computer,

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.190
and then route it along the private network in

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.980
your home. This is a little trickier, and involves

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.560
changing parts of the transport layer which we'll discuss later.
