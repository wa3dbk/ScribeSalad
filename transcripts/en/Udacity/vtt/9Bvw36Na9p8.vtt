00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.815
Since these functions aren't inverses of each other, let's find their actual

00:00:03.815 --> 00:00:08.982
inverses. What is the inverse of f? And what is the inverse of g? Once you

00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:12.454
think you've found them, make sure that you check your work by finding f of f

00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:17.890
inverse of x, and all these other compositions down here. Remember what they

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.545
all need to equal in order to verify that these actually are the inverse

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:22.679
functions we're looking for.
