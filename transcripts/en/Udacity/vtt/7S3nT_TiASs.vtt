00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.936
The second component is the behavioral component. And this refers to the ways

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:08.234
in which I behave towards the Red Wings. Well obviously I buy a lot of Red

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:12.744
Wings material. If the Red Wings are on TV, I'll watch a game. If I don't have

00:00:12.744 --> 00:00:17.073
access to a TV, I'll listen to them on the radio. When the Red Wings come to

00:00:17.073 --> 00:00:20.578
town, I'll buy a ticket and go see them. And this year, I even went to the

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:24.240
hotel where they stayed so I could to try to meet some of my Red Wings.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.210
Obviously, I have a strong behavioral component in my attitude towards the Red

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.077
Wings. And the third component is the cognitive component. And this refers to

00:00:32.077 --> 00:00:34.929
the rational thoughts and beliefs that make up my attitude towards the Red

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:39.832
Wings. So here, I know things such as how many Stanley Cup championships we

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:45.343
won, 11. When we first started the league in 1926. I know the famous Red Wing

00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:49.243
players, such as Gordie Howe, Ted Lindsay, Steve Yzerman, Brendan Shanahan,

00:00:49.243 --> 00:00:54.900
Nick Lindstrom. I know all the players' names and numbers. I know the rules of

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.608
the game, I know the coaches, and I even know the hometown announcers. All

00:00:59.608 --> 00:01:03.871
those are cognitive components of my attitude towards the Red Wings. Let's go

00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:05.790
back and finish up this part on attitudes.
