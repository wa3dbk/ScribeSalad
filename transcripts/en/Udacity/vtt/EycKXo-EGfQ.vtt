00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here comes a tricky question.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Given that we have a pie chart with distribution 80% and 20%,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm now changing the total number of voter.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm telling you there were 23,000 people voting for party B,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and I'm asking you how many voted for party A such that

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the pie chart over here is exactly the correct one with an 80 to 20 distribution.
