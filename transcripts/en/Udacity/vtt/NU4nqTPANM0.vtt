00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's what I'm going to do.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to start out by keeping track of the results in a list,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which is initially the empty list.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm keeping track of the max value.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Initially we don't have any.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now, the key function, I'm either going to use the key function

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
you provided me, or if you didn't,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm going to use the function that just maps

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
an argument to itself, and that's for this notation here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Lambda x maps to x means

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the function that maps the function to itself.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And then I'm going to go through the iterable.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
For each x, I come up with an x value, which I get

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
by applying the key, and if the x value

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is greater than the max value so far,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
or if I don't have a result yet at all,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and that would be the case if I'm at the first element of the iterable,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
then I want to create the result to be

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
this list of the single item x,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the value of the first one that I've looked at,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and I want to set the max value to be equal to that x value.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If it's a tie, then I just want to append x onto the list of results

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that I've been building up all along.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And then at the end, I want to return the result.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now, of course, I should write tests for this as well

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
just as I always did, and now that I have allmax

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and I have my new version of poker,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I've also got to write a new documentation string here.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I've written a new documentation string for poker

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to say that it's returning a list of the winning hands

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
rather than a single winning hand.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I have the definition terms of allmax.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I should write more tests for allmax.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I should go back and change the tests for poker

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
so that instead of returning a single hand,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
they return a list of the single hand for the tests I have so far.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And then I should also add some more tests where there are some ties

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and make sure that it handles that properly.

00:01:59.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Once I've done that, it looks like I'm done.
