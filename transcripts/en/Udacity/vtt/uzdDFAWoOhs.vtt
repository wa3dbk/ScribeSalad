Now we'd like you to write this flip book animation style in code. We've given

00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:09.419
you a list of image assets to use for "Evil Devices". What you need to do is load

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.777
all of these image assets and place them in the frame array. After your images

00:00:13.777 --> 00:00:16.643
are loaded, you should go through and fill out the rest of the animation

00:00:16.643 --> 00:00:20.538
function here, which will actually draw the flip book animation images to the

00:00:20.538 --> 00:00:23.909
screen as we described before. Make sure that when your animation is finished

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:27.216
you loop back to the beginning. Now before this you need to have some logic

00:00:27.228 --> 00:00:31.086
that checks for whether or not the images are loaded, and once all of the frames

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:34.931
have been loaded, actually does a call to setInterval. Now setInterval takes

00:00:34.943 --> 00:00:39.471
as input a pointer to a function you'd like to call as well as a millisecond

00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:42.984
count on how often you want it to be called. So, for instance, if I made a

00:00:42.984 --> 00:00:46.819
function and wanted it to be called once every 30 milliseconds, those would be

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:50.255
parameters that I pass into it. Make sure that your setInterval call, actually

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:53.159
calls the animate function, once every 30 milliseconds.
