00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.406
Now that you know a little bit about ArrayLists, it's time to revisit an old

00:00:03.406 --> 00:00:08.055
friend, the Person class. I removed some of the methods and added one new one.

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:13.810
GetFriend gets the ith friend, but as you can see it's a pretty ugly method.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.411
This is bad code. I wasn't careful when I wrote it and it's messy. It would

00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:21.739
work alright if my friends are named Madonna, Sting, and Cher. But most people

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:26.008
have spaces in their names. Maybe I could fix this by separating the names with

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:30.478
commas or semicolons. I could change the separator here. But that won't really

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:33.648
fix the underlying problem. The underlying problem is that reality has

00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:37.320
structure and we need to choose the right data types to model that structure.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.504
In our case we have multiple individual people. A string of names isn't the

00:00:41.504 --> 00:00:45.230
right way to save a bunch of individuals who all play a similar role. An

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.303
ArrayList would be much better for this. Saving an ArrayList of Person objects,

00:00:49.303 --> 00:00:53.980
instead of just a string of friends would allow us to do a lot of cool things.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.857
For example, we could add a string nationality to each person. And then you can

00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:01.665
get a list of all the countries your friends are from. But let's work our way

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:05.831
up to problems like that. First, let's store the friends in an ArrayList of

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:10.630
strings without changing the observable behavior. In software engineering this

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.001
would be called refactoring. Refactoring is when you reorganize code. The

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.769
implementation changes. The observable behavior does not change. Often we do

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:22.485
this to make it easier to add new features. Now I want you to refactor the

00:01:22.485 --> 00:01:26.200
person class. I'll give you some tests so you can make sure nothing breaks in

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.785
the process. You'll need to update the instance variables. Save the friend's

00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:34.731
names in an ArrayList of strings. You'll need to update addFriend, getFriend

00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:38.643
and getFriends. We'll skip unfriend for the moment, but we will come back to it

00:01:38.643 --> 00:01:42.680
later. And I'm going to give you a hint. Do you remember the toString method

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.145
from lesson two? ToString returns a representation of the object, and works

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:50.343
pretty well for ArrayList of strings. Let me show you what it does. If I create

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:53.820
an ArrayList, strs, and add a couple of strings to it, like this, and then I

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.150
call the toString method. The toString method returns, a string, that has the

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.602
values separated by commas and spaces and then surrounded by brackets. This is

00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:08.368
pretty close to what you want for the getFriends method. For the getFriends

00:02:08.368 --> 00:02:13.268
method, you just want the values separated by commas and spaces. And here's one

00:02:13.268 --> 00:02:17.520
last hint. If you get an error that Java doesn't know what an ArrayList is, you

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.699
might need to import it.
