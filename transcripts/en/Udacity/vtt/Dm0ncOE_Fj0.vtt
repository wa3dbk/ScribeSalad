00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.779
We can cancel an x minus 3 in the numerator and the denominator. We can also

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.176
cancel an x minus 2. Now we're left with these factors. We want to be careful

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:14.300
here. We can't simplify 3 x minus 2 and 3 x plus 2. They're not identical

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.187
rational expressions. And they're not opposite polynomials, since the 3 x have

00:00:18.187 --> 00:00:22.970
the same signs. The same is true of x minus 3 and x plus 3. The signs for the x

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.294
terms are the same. So these are not identical polynomials, and they're not

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:32.922
opposite polynomials. We can, however, simplify 2x and 6x. You know, x divided

00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:38.175
by x equals 1. And 2 divided by 6 reduces to 1 third. You want to make sure you

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:41.675
don't forget about monomial terms. Be sure to cancel common factors for the

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:47.038
numbers. And common powers for the variables. After we've done that we have our

00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:53.798
simplified rational expression, 3x minus 2 times x minus 3 and 3x plus 2 times 3

00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:55.066
times x plus 3.
