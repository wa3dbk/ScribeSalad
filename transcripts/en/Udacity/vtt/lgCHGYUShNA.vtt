00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.820
Let's look at the solution to our
write-update optimization quiz

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.360
where we have two cores with
write-update coherence and

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.560
we consider the case of no optimization,
dirty-bit only optimization,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.250
and both dirty-bit and
shared-bit optimization.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.890
And for this program, how many bus
uses and memory writes do we get?

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.500
So, let's consider the case
of no optimization first.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.890
Let us first consider
the no optimization case.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.320
This right here we'll use the bus and
we'll write to memory.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.230
This read here,
the first one we'll use the bus but

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.920
we'll not update the memory
because this is a read miss.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.500
&gt;From then on, each write on core 0
will use the bus to broadcast and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.180
update memory, so we get 999 more
accesses to each because of this,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.950
whereas reads are no longer going to
be misses, and they find what they

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.260
are looking for in the cache, so they're
no longer going to either bus or memory.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.588
Eventually this cache is replace this.

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:09.340
But nothing happens on
the replacement in this case

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.050
because everything is
already up to date.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.620
So overall here we got 1001 bus use.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.750
And 1000 memory writes.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.420
Now let us look at the dirty-bit
only optimization.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.440
In this optimization, the writes on
core 0 will all be happening to core

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.950
0s cache and the only write to memory
will be when the block is replaced.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.450
So we get only one memory write.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.480
How many bus uses do we need?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.060
While the first write and every
subsequent write will be broadcast.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.290
So we get 1000 bus accesses
because of these writes.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.730
We still have the one access because the
first read is a miss after that they're

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.720
all hits and don't go to the bus.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.320
And now we have an additional bus
access because the replacement

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.080
of A here needs to send the data to
memory for which we need a bus access.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.090
So overall, we reduce dramatically the
number of memory writes in exchange for

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.929
one more bus use.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.310
Now let's see what happens with
a dirty and shared optimization.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.834
We're right here and at this point we
are the only one who has this blocked so

00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:22.390
the shared bit is not set.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.680
This would normally allow us to write
to it without going to the bus anymore.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.060
But because the very next access
is a read of a on core 1.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.570
The sharing starts and
that means that really

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.820
we have exactly the same number
of bus uses and memory writes.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.430
Remember that the sharing optimization
only works when we are accessing

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.120
a block only on one core.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.920
This block is actually being read
on one core, written on another,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.790
so all the writes on this core need
to be propagated to the bus so

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.250
that this core's cache can be updated.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.450
So really here the shared
bit optimization

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.310
doesn't result in any savings.
