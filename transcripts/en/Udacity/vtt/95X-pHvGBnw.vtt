00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.360
So now that we've decided to go
with a restful architecture for

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.200
our development needs,
what about the structure of our data?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.857
XML and
JSON are two very viable options, so

00:00:09.857 --> 00:00:12.349
let's compare them side by side as well.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.182
XML was developed in 1997.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.681
It uses identifying tags
similar to HTML and

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:20.120
provides a rigid way
of structuring data.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.230
JSON was developed in 2001 and
is derived from the JavaScript language.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.200
Similar to HTML,
it is easily human readable, but

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.960
can be condensed with less
characters to be very lightweight.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.950
Once again, it seems like these specs
aren't really helping in making

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.380
a decision if one is
better than the other.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.390
But since our APIs are made
to best suit the developer,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.070
we should use a data structure that
is most friendly to our end user.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.730
Looking at this chart, we can see that
XML started as the data structure of

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.920
choice, but JSON has been quickly
gaining ground year over year and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.580
is now the more popular data
structure amongst new APIs.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.430
By piggy backing off
the popularity of JavaScript,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.410
JSON has been readily accepted
by the web development community

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.319
as the most common way to structure
data sent across restful APIs.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.650
So for this course,
it's JSON for the win.
