00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.016
To find the balance after two years, we need to first start out with the amount

00:00:03.016 --> 00:00:08.830
of money that's in the account at the beginning of the second year. We know

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.510
that's the amount that the account has at the end of the first year. 10,000

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.816
times 1 plus 0.03. Now, in fact, that's the same value that belongs in these

00:00:18.816 --> 00:00:23.770
other two green boxes. The reason it goes here is because this is the quantity

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.865
that we're going to use to calculate the new amount of interest that needs to

00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:34.070
be added. Now if we look at this entire expression, we can see that what can be

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.650
factored out, is what's already in the green boxes, 10,000 times 1 plus 0.03.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.130
If we factor that out of each term, then what we would end up with for the

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.790
first term here would just be 1, and for the second term it would be 0.03, as

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.633
we see in the parentheses here. Now looking right here, what we see is repeated

00:00:55.633 --> 00:01:02.443
multiplication of 1 plus 0.03. Using exponent notation, that gives us 10,000

00:01:02.443 --> 00:01:06.487
times the quantity 1 plus point oh 3 squared.
