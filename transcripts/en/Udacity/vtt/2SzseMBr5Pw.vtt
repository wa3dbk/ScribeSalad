00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, it seems there's definitely a relationship between these.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the massive point seems to move as page load time increases. I'd say--yes, they are related.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They don't really appear to be linear though.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If I draw a line to try and fit this,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I can do okay for one piece of this but then this piece over here

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
doesn't appear anywhere near that line, or I could possibly draw a line like this

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that's consistent of a lot of range of points, but this appears to be pretty far away.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Definitely not linear and not exact either. You can, say, pick this value.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We have a whole bunch of different click-through rates for the same page load time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, is the relationship positive or negative?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Well, we started off with a higher click-through rate over here.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It seems the only going downward as page load time increases, so we have a negative relationship.

00:01:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
When in fact, the relationship probably looks something like this.
