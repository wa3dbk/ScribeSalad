00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.477
Botnet is the most prevalent
modern-day malware, and

00:00:03.477 --> 00:00:08.050
most internet-based cyber attacks
frauds are due to botnets.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.030
When we talk about botnet, actually
we need to understand two aspects.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.010
One is bot, the other one is net.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.000
So let's first talk about bot.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.160
A bot is also called a zombie.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.820
It is essentially a compromised computer
under the control of an attacker.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.410
When a computer is compromised,
typically the bot code or

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.560
malware is loaded on a computer and
the bot code is responsible for

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.610
communicating with
the attacker's server.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.510
And carries out activities per
the attacker's instruction.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.650
Then a botnet is a network of bots
controlled by an attacker to perform

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.930
coordinated malicious activities.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.670
That is, with a network of bots,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.160
the aggregated combination
of power can be very large.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.830
In other words,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.960
the attacker now controls a very
powerful computing platform.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.310
And with such a powerful platform,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.160
the attacker can launch a wide
variety of malicious activities.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.590
And that's why botnets
are now the key platform for

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.870
most of the Internet-based attacks and
frauds.
