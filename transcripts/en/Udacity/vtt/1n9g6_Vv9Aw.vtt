00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.788
We treat this just as if we were solving an equation, except that of course, we

00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:07.872
have an inequality sign running throughout. We're dividing by a positive number,

00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:11.412
this positive 3, not a negative one, so we have no funny business with the

00:00:11.412 --> 00:00:15.320
signs. And our final answer is, x is less than or equal to 3. And of course, you

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.188
should check your answer. But by now, you know how to do that, so I'm not going

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:20.180
to take the time to.
