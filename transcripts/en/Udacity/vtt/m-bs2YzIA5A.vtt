00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.134
The answer is that the graph would shift down by 2 units. We can see that

00:00:05.134 --> 00:00:09.017
that's happened in the graph over here. This was the original function, f of x

00:00:09.017 --> 00:00:13.734
equals x squared. And this is the transformed one, f of x equals x squared

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:19.286
minus 2. So, subtracting 2 shifts us down 2. Interesting. You probably remember

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:20.694
this from the section on the section on

00:00:20.694 --> 00:00:21.090
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.349
earlier on in the course but it never hurts to do some review.
