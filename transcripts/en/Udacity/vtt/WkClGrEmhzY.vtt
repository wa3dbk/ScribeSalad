00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.719
So now, that you know how
individual UI elements are sized.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.730
Let's talk about how to start
arranging them together.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.680
Let's have a quick refresher on what you
learned in Android Fundamentals 1 about

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.740
the core layout managers.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.580
Like frame layout, linear layout,
and relative layout.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.870
Now, remember a frame layout
arranges the views inside it,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.410
one on top of each other and
each view can have a gravity or

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.490
stretch to fill the width or
height of the parent frame layout.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.840
So frame layouts are a great way
to display overlapping content.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.430
A linear layout arranges its
children in a single direction.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.160
For example,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.730
a vertical linear layout arranges
its children from top to bottom.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.070
Linear layout is one of the most useful
layouts to have in your toolbox.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.690
You can create pretty
much any layout with it.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.080
Be careful though not to over rely
on this as another layout might be

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.450
more efficient way to
create the desired effect.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.870
A relative layout arranges its chart
views relative to each other or

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.980
to its bounds.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.150
So for example,
a field can align to the top left or

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.840
top right or to the bottom
edge of the relative layout.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.740
While a relative layout can be powerful,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.240
it also has some
performance implications.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.440
So be weary of using this layout
especially near the root of your

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.790
hierarchy.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.070
A GridLayout arranges
children in a grid, shocker.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.420
When each child has a given row or

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.750
column within that grid, they can be
arranged automatically in any direction.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.555
And now, have a weight property
in order to fill a column or row.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:32.730
GridLayout is a great way if you want
to align content along multiple axes,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.030
such as vertically and
horizontally at the same time in a grid

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.322
which you would be hard to achieve with
a different nested layout manager.

00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:44.160
A ScrollView is a very simple view
which holds one single child.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.480
It allows you to scroll its contents,
either up or down.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.100
In under fundamentals,
we also touched on ListView and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.910
its newer cousins RecyclerView and
ViewPager and how it dynamically uses

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.900
a small number of child views to present
a small window into a larger collection.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.120
ListView and RecyclerView let you
scroll through a list of items,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.400
while ViewPager let's you horizontally
page through individual items.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.100
To understand when to use a particular
view group, let's take a look at some

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.520
examples of real world screens and
talk about how you would build them.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.400
After that, we'll show you a quiz and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.400
ask you, yes you, to apply layouts
to build up a relatively complex UI.
