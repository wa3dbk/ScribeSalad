00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.859
Alright, Michael. What's the answer?

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:03.670
&gt;&gt; I think I've already made a mistake.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.100
&gt;&gt; Okay. What's the mistake?

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.120
&gt;&gt; Suggesting that we do a quiz.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.670
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm pretty sure that's always true. Unless

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.060
Michael, by doing a quiz now and suffering pain,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.440
you, in the future, are a better person. In

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.880
which case, you have made the right long term decision.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.710
&gt;&gt; I see. You're, this is a MDP metapoint you're making.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.923
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:25.390
&gt;&gt; Alright. So let, but let's, let's just buckle down and do

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.110
this thing. So.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.610
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.920
&gt;&gt; Alright, so at that state x, we have

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.180
to consider, according to the equation, we're going to do

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.830
U sub one at x. And that's going to be

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.503
the reward at x, which is minus .04. Mm-hm.

00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:40.380
&gt;&gt; Plus gamma, which is a half.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.120
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.470
&gt;&gt; Feel free to write these things down.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:51.150
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, let's see. It's going to be minus .04 plus one half times.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.930
&gt;&gt; Alright. So now we need to do four different actions.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.560
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.740
&gt;&gt; So, I don, I would make like a brace-y

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.250
thing at this point. Not a bracket, but a brace. Alright?

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.760
&gt;&gt; Or I could do a bracket, because you're going to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.840
notice immediately that it's obvious what the right action is.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.840
&gt;&gt; Okay, alright. Well, we know that the, the

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.670
right action's going to be to go to the right.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but even then, you know you don't

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.190
have to do the rest of the computation because my

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.710
first guess at all the utilities is

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.140
that they're 0. Which means you're always going

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.760
to want to take the action that gets you to plus one with the highest chance.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.840
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.670
&gt;&gt; So there's just no point in.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.350
&gt;&gt; I see. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you for.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.470
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.000
&gt;&gt; The shortcut. So, so we only have to

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.500
do the one action which is to the right.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.801
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:32.020
&gt;&gt; And so if we go to the right,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.010
there's three possible next states we could go in.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.980
&gt;&gt; One is back to x, which has a value of zero.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.785
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:41.620
&gt;&gt; One is to the thing underneath of x, which has a value of zero.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.690
And then the last one with probability 0.8 needs to go to the plus one.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.870
&gt;&gt; Which is.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.790
&gt;&gt; 0.8 times plus one.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.180
&gt;&gt; Which is 0.8.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.770
&gt;&gt; 0.8.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.170
&gt;&gt; Okay. And that is?

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.389
&gt;&gt; Okay. So 0.8 times a half is 0.4 minus 0.04 is 0.36.

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:01.990
&gt;&gt; Yep. And that is correct.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.060
&gt;&gt; Okay, so to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.810
do the same thing for you too, we're going to need the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.570
U1 value for a bunch of other states, seems to me.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.590
&gt;&gt; Maybe, so let's right that down. So we

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.370
know for now the utility here is .36 right?

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.740
&gt;&gt; And you're saying that in order to do U two,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm now going to have to, you know, I was able to avoid

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.060
doing some of the math before because, these are all zeroes.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.280
So it was just easy to do. But when I went right,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.900
I either stayed where I was, went to the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.960
plus one, or I ended up going down. Well I

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.170
think by the same argument that allowed us to cheat

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.460
our way out of to cheat our way out before.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.160
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.350
&gt;&gt; It's still going to be best to go to the right, so.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah but I know that but the value itself

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.580
is going to depend on the value in several other states.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah well how many other states?

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:55.770
&gt;&gt; Oh, just that one.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.860
&gt;&gt; Just this one,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.900
so what was U one of this state? I see. So, presumably, we want to avoid falling

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.700
into the pit, so the, the best thing we

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.230
can do is bash our head against the wall,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.455
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:03:07.455 --> 00:03:09.220
&gt;&gt; Which will get us a -.04 for that statement.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.640
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.410
&gt;&gt; Okay, alright, so maybe this isn't so, so bad.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.783
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:12.783 --> 00:03:16.217
&gt;&gt; So now for our u2 values we need -.04

00:03:16.217 --> 00:03:21.274
plus a half times point, point one times point 36. Plus.

00:03:21.274 --> 00:03:21.908
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:27.573
&gt;&gt; 0.1 times negative 0.04, so that's minus 0.004,

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:33.330
plus 0.8 times one. Oh, which is 0.8 again, just like it was last time.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.490
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.315
&gt;&gt; And I get 0.376.

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:38.640
&gt;&gt; Which is what I get by also getting

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.290
out your calculator. Okay, so 0.376, and you can imagine

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.230
how we would do that on and on. I want

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.330
to point something out, Michael, which is that. You decided

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.420
to figure what the true utility was for the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.100
state under X by bashing your head into the

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.780
wall. But you know that based on the discussion

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.000
we had earlier that actually the optimal policy would involve

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.980
going up instead of bashing your head into the

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.610
wall. What you did at that point was in

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.540
fact right because everything else in this utilities were

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.150
all zero. The best thing you could do is avoid

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.269
getting, avoid ever falling into minus one, so the policy

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.779
of the very first of bashing your head into the

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.180
wall, is infact the right thing to do at that

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.670
point. But what youll notice is that next time around

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.710
the utility for the X state Is bigger than zero.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.470
In fact, will keep getting bigger and bigger than zero.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.020
As you can see, it went from .36 to 0.376.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.980
Which means that at some point it's going to be worthwhile

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.420
to try to go up instead of bashing your head into a wall.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.560
&gt;&gt; I see. So this, so this is kind of cool that it

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.920
works. But, it does seem like a really roundabout way of getting there.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.970
I mean, is there some way that we could some, I don't

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.380
know, maybe take advantage of the fact that there's not that many policies?

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you actually said something, fairly

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.650
subtle there, so let's see if we can

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.040
unpack it. So, lemme point out two things, which I think will get us to what

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.310
you're answering. The first is. Do you realize

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.220
that the reason that the value iteration works is

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.470
because eventually value propagates out from its neighbors,

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.310
right? The first time we can calculate the .36

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.560
without really worrying about anything around it because

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.810
the utilities are all zero, and in fact, based

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.140
on the initial utilities. Even for this state

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.100
here, we do the wrong thing. But after some

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.140
time, this state becomes a truer representation of its utility

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.350
and, in fact, gets higher and higher. The right thing to

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.650
do here will go up. You'll also notice that after

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.100
another time step I'm going to need to start looking at

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.680
the value of this state as well. Alright. So, eventually

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.880
I'm going to have to figure out the value, the utilities

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.800
or the values of all of these states and this

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.650
plus one is going to propagate out towards the other states.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.550
Where this minus one will propagate out less because you're going to try

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.090
to avoid falling in there. So that

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.030
makes sense, right? But what's propagating out,

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.600
Michael? What's propagating out is the true utilities, the true values of these

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.950
states. But what's a policy? A policy is a function from what to what?

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.670
&gt;&gt; States to actions.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.890
&gt;&gt; Right, a policy is the mapping from

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.050
state to action. It is not a mapping from

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.870
states to utilities.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.590
&gt;&gt; No, that's what U is.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.000
&gt;&gt; That's what U is.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.860
&gt;&gt; Or that's what you are.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.430
&gt;&gt; So, [LAUGH], so if we have U, we can figure out pi, but U

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.400
is actually much more information than we need to figure out pi. If we have a

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.810
U that is not the correct utility, but

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.400
say, has the ordering of the actions correct,

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.750
then we're actually doing pretty well, right? It

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.318
doesn't matter whether we have the wrong utilities.

00:06:43.318 --> 00:06:44.753
&gt;&gt; I see. Uh-huh.

00:06:44.753 --> 00:06:45.290
&gt;&gt; You'll remember

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.960
we did this in the, the first third of the class

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.310
as well when we noticed that we were computing in the

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.540
Bayesian learning case actual probabilities. But we don't really care about

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.330
actual probabilities. We just care that the labels are right. There's

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.860
a very similar argument here. We don't care about having the

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.270
correct utilities, even though by having the correct utilities, we have

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.660
the right policy. All we actually care about is getting the

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.480
right policy. And order matters there rather than absolute value. Does that

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.850
make sense?

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's interesting. It's almost kind of like pi

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.890
is more of like a classifier, right? It's mapping. Inputs

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.990
to discreet classes and the user kind of like, more

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.970
like regression where its mapping these states to continuous values.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.750
&gt;&gt; Right and given one, given the utilities, we

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.340
can find pi, given pi there's an infinite number

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.840
of utilities that are. Consistent with it. So, what

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.990
you end up wanting to do is get a utility

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.420
that's good enough to get you to your pie. Which is one reason why you don't

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.872
have to worry about getting the absolute convergence

00:07:41.872 --> 00:07:44.520
in [UNKNOWN]. But it gives us a hint of

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.010
something we might do that's a little bit

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.030
better with the policies that might go faster

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.920
in practise. So, I'm just going to take three

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.780
seconds to give you an example of that. Okay?

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.630
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
