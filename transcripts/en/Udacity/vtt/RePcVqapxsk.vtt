00:00:00.546 --> 00:00:02.372
Let's take a look at our Jersey Square team

00:00:02.372 --> 00:00:04.260
and because they understand their archetype

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.669
is interested in both subscription and rental,

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:09.211
let's see what they were thinking.

00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:11.456
And they said well, let's see one

00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:14.176
particular model could be an annual subscription,

00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:16.600
which is a strategy and here is the tactic

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.690
at a $199 per year and we could give them

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.986
authentic top of line jerseys and free shipping

00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:26.456
and send a jersey back and exchange for another.

00:00:26.456 --> 00:00:29.414
We could offer them either a yearly price

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:32.222
or we could offer a monthly price which

00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:34.263
would cost more but wouldn't commit them

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:35.951
for such a longer period of time

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:38.077
but they would get the exact same features.

00:00:38.077 --> 00:00:39.754
They discovered there was another archetype,

00:00:39.754 --> 00:00:43.413
another customer segment that was casual users.

00:00:43.413 --> 00:00:45.779
And these people just wanted a one-time

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:49.918
use for a one-week rental for a particular game.

00:00:49.918 --> 00:00:52.955
Well you get a top of line jersey and you get

00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:55.765
shipping but the goal was you send the jersey

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:58.502
back within one week and we won't charge you

00:00:58.502 --> 00:01:00.925
for the jersey and that's a rental.

00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:03.019
So they had three pricing models, they were

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.019
now going to a/b test for price elasticity.
