00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.577
Let's take a look at our previous code to load an image. Now remember, it was

00:00:03.577 --> 00:00:06.688
three lines of code to create an image, set a callback, and then define the

00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:10.774
source. The first steps in writing an asset manager would be to cache this

00:00:10.774 --> 00:00:14.140
image once it's loaded so that duplicate calls won't issue a reload, but rather

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.520
would return the image we've already loaded in memory. To do this, you're going

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.714
to implement the concept of a cache. What will happen is, the first request

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:27.080
will go through, and the data will be loaded. When it's loaded, you add it to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.978
the cache using some key value, like its name, so that subsequent requests,

00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:32.830
rather than going out to disk, or to the web, will check the cache first, and

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.043
return the already loaded asset. What I'd like you to do is to modify the

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:41.488
following code so the asset loader checks the cache before attempting to load

00:00:41.488 --> 00:00:46.371
the image. Now there's a couple things to point out here, is that gCachedAssets

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:49.816
is actually a dictionary object, which means that you need to specify a key and

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:54.908
value when accessing and referencing to it. Also take note, that here in the

00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:57.884
img.onload callback is where you need to do your heavy lifting to push your

00:00:57.884 --> 00:01:00.730
data into this cache object. Good luck.
