00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.145
So let's try to think about a method that might perform better

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:06.417
for matrices with varying numbers of non-zero elements per row.

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:08.814
If you'll recall, the approach that we pursued in Unit 4

00:00:08.814 --> 00:00:12.887
was to assign a thread to each element, do 1 multiplication per element,

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:18.146
then use a backwards inclusive segmented sum scan to add up the partial products

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:19.596
and generate a result per row.

00:00:19.596 --> 00:00:23.300
Let's look at this approach step by step so that we can understand it.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.138
So we're going to start with a CSR representation of the matrix.

00:00:26.138 --> 00:00:29.274
So step 1, we are going to use the row pointer data structure

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:34.312
to generate an array with 1s for segment heads and 0s for non-segment heads.

00:00:34.312 --> 00:00:37.545
Then were going to launch a thread for each element in the matrix.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:40.019
We're going to multiply it by the corresponding vector element,

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.755
which we fetch using the index data structure.

00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:47.925
For thread n, that code will look like value(n) times x(index(n)).

00:00:47.925 --> 00:00:51.083
Then were going to perform our backwards inclusive segmented sum scan,

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:54.034
which will sum up all of the partial products in the matrix row.

00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:57.401
And then finally, the output of that sum scan will be a sparse vector,

00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:00.277
which we might want to pack back into a dense vector.

00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:04.590
And we can use the row pointer addresses to gather that sparse vector back into the dense vector.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.693
Now let's go answer the same question we asked about the thread per row approach.
