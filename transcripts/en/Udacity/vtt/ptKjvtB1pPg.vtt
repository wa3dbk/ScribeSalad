00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.207
This equation represents a parabola that opens up. Great work if you got that

00:00:06.207 --> 00:00:10.924
one right. If we divide each of these coefficients by 3, we'll get the equation

00:00:10.924 --> 00:00:16.168
y equals one third x squared, minus one third. Notice that the equation is y

00:00:16.168 --> 00:00:20.570
equals, and we have an x squared term. Since we only have an x squared term,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.594
and just a single y, we know it's a parabola. We don't have both x squared and

00:00:25.594 --> 00:00:30.675
y squared. Also, since this parabola starts with a y. And since it's in y

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:34.944
equals, we know it's either going to open up or it's going to open down. We

00:00:34.944 --> 00:00:39.070
then look to the coefficient in front of x squared and see that it's positive.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.643
So hey, our parabola opens up.
