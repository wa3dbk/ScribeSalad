00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.690
In this lesson we'll look at Jellyfish,

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.310
a technique to network data centers randomly.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.180
The goals of Jellyfish are to achieve

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.960
high throughput to support, for example, big data

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.260
analytics or agile placement of virtual machines

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.070
and incremental expandability, so that network operators can

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.230
easily add or replace servers and switches.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.470
For example, large companies like Facebook are adding

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.020
capacity on a daily basis. Commercial products

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.550
make it easy to expand or provision servers

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.890
in response to changing traffic load but

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.726
not the network. Unfortunately, the structure of the

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:42.690
data center networks constrains expansion. Structures such

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.950
as a hypercube require two to the K

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.630
switches, where K is the number of

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.790
servers. Even more efficient topologies, like a FAT

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.460
tree, are still quadratic in the number of servers.
