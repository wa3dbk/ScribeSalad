00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.397
What we're looking for is the point of intersection between our line x equals 75

00:00:05.397 --> 00:00:10.686
and the line that corresponds to brand 1. So, we follow the teal line up until

00:00:10.686 --> 00:00:16.001
it intersects the purple line, which happens right here. We follow that over to

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:21.265
the y-axis. That point looks like it's halfway between this grid line and this

00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:27.056
grid line, or halfway between 800 and 900, if we count up from 500. So, it looks

00:00:27.056 --> 00:00:29.535
like Grant will pay $850.
