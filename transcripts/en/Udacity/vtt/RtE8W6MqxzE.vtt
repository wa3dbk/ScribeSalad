00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.000
UITableViews have two delegate
protocols, with a total of 44 methods.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.400
The two protocols
are the UITableViewDelegate,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.080
which governs responses to user events,
and

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.780
the UITableViewDataSource, which enables
the table to access data in cells.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.940
So, think of the delegate as
being associated with events.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.360
And the data source is being associated
with data, appropriately enough.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.870
The table uses its delegate protocol
to ask event questions like these.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.172
What should happen when
a button in a cell is tapped?

00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:34.110
What should be the response
to cell selection,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.410
how should I respond when
a user begins editing a row?

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.200
What should happen when
a cell is deselected,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.440
the table uses it's data source protocol
to ask data questions like these.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.010
How many rows do I have,
how many sections do I have?

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.640
What are the titles for the sections,
what is the cell view for each row?

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.900
Here I've opened the class reference for
the UITableViewDelegate.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.600
Where you can find a complete
list of the protocols methods.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.430
Many are related to managing sections,
like the ones we saw in the context and

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.760
settings apps.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.320
Don't worry about those as much for

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.680
now, since we'll be focusing
on single section tables.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.220
Visit the documentation on your own,
skim through the list.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.360
And for each method,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.600
think about the question that
the view is asking its delegate.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.970
When you're done,
answer the quiz question.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.760
Think of yourself as a table.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.130
If you could only ask three
of these questions and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.210
you needed to build a single section
table, which would you pick?
