00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.100
For the rest of this, and next, and
next, we're going to be talking about

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.890
discriminative methods for
doing recognition or classification.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.340
By the way, I'll probably use those
words interchangeably, classification,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.460
recognition.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.126
Probably a little sloppy of me
because we talked a little bit about

00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:16.250
the difference.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.760
I'm just basically talking about
classifying something as being

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.980
an A or a B.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.905
Or even more precisely, an A or a not-A.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.820
Before we go forward, we're going to
make some assumptions, okay?

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.150
Our first assumption.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.051
We're going to assume that there's
a fixed number of known classes, right?

00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:33.151
So I'm going to tell you,

00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:36.071
there are four things in this
universe you have to worry about.

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:40.790
Now, they might be As, Bs,
Cs, and none of the above.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.770
But it's not like later I'm
going to give you some Ds or

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.130
later I'm going to give you some Es.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.940
No, I'm going to tell you
the classes that exist a priori.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.980
So when I train this system and
I'm defining the boundaries, I'm only

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.430
worrying about the classes that you
tell me in advance that I know about.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.780
The other thing I'm going to assume
is that I've got plenty of data.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.020
I've got training examples
that come from this class, and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.750
it might not be,
shall we say, that data hard.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.570
You know, I've got an exponential
amount, but I've got lots of data.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.600
So it's possible for me to typically
find points that tend to be,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.160
you know, might get confused
with some other class.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.060
For the conversations we're going to
have today and the next time,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.120
we're going to assume
an equal cost of mistakes.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.190
So it costs you just as
much to call an A a not-A

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.150
as it does to call a not-A an A.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
In fact,
one of the methods we'll talk about,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.950
the fact that some of the distributions
might be quite asymmetric, right?

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.210
So you might be looking for,
say, I don't know, faces.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.260
We're going to do that one.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.650
In an image, you may know that most
places in an image, in most images,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.990
are not faces.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.700
So you might take advantage of that fact
in terms of how you search for them.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.810
But we're not going to worry
about the relative cost.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.230
Remember that loss function between
making the two kinds of mistakes.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.660
And the other thing is,
that we're going to assume, is that,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.040
and this is actually
good because it's true.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.040
It's always good to assume true things.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.260
We need to build a representation
of each instance.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.040
So we're going to build a description.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.280
But we don't know a priori
what features actually matter.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.950
So we're going to write down a whole
bunch of things about each instance.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.000
And then we're going to train a discri,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.230
a discriminative classifier to make
the distinction, the the classification,

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.640
and it'll have to figure out where
the information is in the feature.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.590
All right, so that's a lot of assuming,
but I'm good at making assumptions.
