00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.930
Let's discuss a couple of more complex things

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.740
that we want to do. We may not always want

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.000
to pull thousands of rows, or even the first 20 rows in order. Maybe we want a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.570
specific subset of our data. For example, maybe

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.420
we're interested in all data corresponding to the state

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.710
Gujarat. In order to do that, we'd simply write,

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.540
select star from aadhaar_data, where state equals Gujarat. Note

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.190
that to limit our results, the where clause needs to go directly after the

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.460
table name. SQL syntax really does mirror the way we might say things out

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.260
loud very closely. Now, let's see what happens if we run this command. And

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.705
there you see, we have all the data where the state is equal to Gujarat.
