00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.750
Now that we've understood
the satisfiability problem,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.790
we're ready to tackle
the Cook-Levin theorem.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.110
Remember that we have to turn any
problem in NP into an instance of SAT.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.760
So it's natural to start with the thing
that we know all problems in NP

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.478
have in common.

00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:20.430
There's a non-deterministic machine
that decides them in polynomial time.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.060
That's the definition, after all.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.700
Therefore, let L be an arbitrary
language in NP, and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.610
let M be a non-deterministic
Turing machine that decides L

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.490
in time at most p(n),
where, p is a polynomial.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.850
In accepting computation, or
sequence of configurations for

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.340
the machine M, can be represented
in a tableau like this one here.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.450
Each configuration in a sequence
is represented by a row.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.589
Where we have one column for the state,
one column for the head position,

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.100
and columns for the values of
the first p event squares of the tape.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.780
Note that no other squares can be
written to because there just isn't time

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.480
to move the head that far
in only p event steps.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.170
Of course, the first row must
represent the initial configuration.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.200
And the last one must be in
an accepting state in order for

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.010
the overall computation to be accepted.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.460
Note that it's possible that the machine
will enter an accepting state before

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.980
step P event, but we can just
stipulate that when this happens,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.950
all the rest of the rows in
the table have the same values.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.140
This is like having the accept
state always transition to itself.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.810
The Cook-Levin theorem then,
consists of arguing that the existence

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.990
of an accepting computation is
equivalent to being able to satisfy

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.000
a CNF formula that captures all
the rules for filling out this table.
