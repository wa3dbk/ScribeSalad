Here the answers were negative 3 plus or minus 5i, imaginary solutions. We

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:09.098
start by simply completing the square, we have our x squared term here and our

00:00:09.098 --> 00:00:14.385
x term here. The b value is positive 6, so we find b over 2 which is 3 and then

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:19.394
square this which is 9. We add 9 to both sides of our equation, so that way we

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:24.342
can complete the square on this side. We rewrite our trinominal as the quantity

00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:29.720
x plus 3 squared, and then add these two together to get negative 25. We use

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.945
our square root method to take the square root of both sides. So x plus 3 can

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:38.684
equal positive or negative 5i. Keep in mind we have a negative radicant here,

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:43.942
so the square root of 25 is 5 and the square root of negative 1 is i. And,

00:00:43.942 --> 00:00:47.281
finally, to solve for x, we simply subtract 3 from both sides to get our final

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.650
answers.
