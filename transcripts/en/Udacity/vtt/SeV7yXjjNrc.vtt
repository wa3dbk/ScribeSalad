00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.525
Here, the inverse function is x plus 5 divided by 6. Great thinking, if you

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:10.897
found this inverse function. One way to find the inverse is to switch the x and

00:00:10.897 --> 00:00:17.772
y variables. Once we switch x and y, then we can solve for y. So, adding 5 to

00:00:17.772 --> 00:00:24.259
both sides, will get x plus 5 equals 6y. Then, we'll divide both sides by six,

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:30.827
to get y equals x plus 5 divided by 6. And remember, our last step is to

00:00:30.827 --> 00:00:36.998
replace this y with f inverse of x, since this represents the inverse function.

00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:41.219
Now, the other way to reason through this answer is to think about what we did

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.136
to x. We multiplied it by 6, and then subtracted 5. So we want to undo this

00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:53.275
subtraction of 5, and then the multiplication of 6. We always undo the last

00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:59.162
operation we performed. So first, we'll take x and add 5, and then we'll divide

00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:05.668
that quantity by 6. We'll do the opposite of multiplying by 6. This also will

00:01:05.668 --> 00:01:07.420
give us our inverse function.
