00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The correct answer is: The parameter doesn't appear at all on the URL.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's try that out in the browser to see it, for real.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So here we are in our browser; I click Submit,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
with the checkbox unchecked,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and there is no "q" parameter in the URL. Simple enough.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now--when I'm writing Server site software

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to look at these values,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I usually check for the "q" parameter equaling "on"

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and anything different from that means it's "off".

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That's because I don't believe that all browsers

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
are going to behave quite the same here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I know "on" is "on"--but, maybe it says "this string off"--who knows.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So I always just check for one case,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.214
and the default case will just be "off".
