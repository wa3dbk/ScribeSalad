00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.470
So how do we make this BTB realistic? It needs to be small yet

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.910
it needs to work this way. First of all we don't need to have an entry for

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.220
every possible PC. It's enough if we have enough entries for

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.230
all the instructions that are likely to execute soon. So for

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.010
example if our program is executing a loop that has about a hundred instructions

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.160
of code we really need only slightly more than a 100 entries. After the first

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.020
iteration of the loop the BTB will be populated with instructions in the loop,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.670
at which point we will keep finding what we need in the BTB. So

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.440
now we have relatively few entries in the BTB. Let's say that we do our timing

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.170
experiments and we find that only 1,024 entries can be accessed in one cycle.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.910
The question is now, there are many, many possible PCs. How do we map each PC

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.840
to an entry in a way that avoids conflicts among different PCs that map to

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.140
the same entry? And note also that we need this mapping function to be really,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.120
really simple because any delay in computing the mapping function means that we

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.500
need an even smaller BTB so that the whole thing finishes in one cycle.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.320
The way we do this is the program counter from which we are fetching,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.920
is let's say is 64 bit to byte. So it has bits starting from zero, to 63.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.380
We need 10 bits to index into our BTB. So what we will do is we'll take

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.900
the least significant ten bits and use that as the index into our BTB.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.980
This mapping function is really fast because we do is we

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.760
just take things ten bits and we just feed that to the BTB as an index.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.090
Why are we using the least significant bits and not the most significant bits?

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.720
Think about the typical program where an instruction has some sort of PC address

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.570
and then the next instruction will have an address that is very close to it.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.170
For example, just increment by four and so on.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.880
So if we were using the most significant bits of the PC, all instructions that

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.450
are in the same part of the program would map to the same entry.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.830
because they have the same most significant bits. Thus, if you have a loop of

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.170
some sort here, all of the instructions in the loop would map to the same entry,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.210
so that as we execute this loop, these instructions are kicking each

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.950
other's stuff from the BTB, which we don't want to have. We want each of

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.020
these to have an entry. If we use the least significant bits, what we get

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.750
is that each instruction gets a different entry from nearby instructions, thus

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.980
ensuring that things like loops and functions and so on neatly map to the BTB.
