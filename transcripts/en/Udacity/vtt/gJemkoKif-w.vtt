00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.140
The answer is that neither language is
recognizable or at least it isn't clear.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.770
We can't just simulate every input
because no matter how long we run

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.840
the simulation.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.000
Even with dovetailing, there will be
some input that we haven't checked yet.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.960
Now consider the confident language,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.460
those Turing machines that
don't halt on some input.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.940
Well I could try simulating all inputs
until I find one it does not halt on.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.540
But how would I tell
that it doesn't halt?

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.110
It's unclear for now and we will see
how actually we can't tell in general.
