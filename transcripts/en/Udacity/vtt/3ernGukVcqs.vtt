00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.080
We're going to focus here on
optimizing for Sharpe ratio.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.577
So solving that problem is not trivial,
but it's not too hard either.

00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:13.536
What we need to do is frame
the portfolio optimization problem as

00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:15.370
a minimization problem, and

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.570
then we can solve it using
the tools you have already.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.240
As you recall, in order to use
a optimizer that minimizes,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.120
we have to do three things.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:35.460
First, we have to provide a function
to minimize f(x) that takes in x, two,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.260
an initial guess for that x, and three,
call the optimizer and let it run.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, in this case, x are the allocations
that we're looking for.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.869
And we want the optimizer to try
different allocations in order

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:55.253
to discover the best set of allocations
that optimizes this function.

00:00:55.253 --> 00:00:57.243
Well, what is that function exactly?

00:00:57.243 --> 00:01:01.370
We said just a moment ago that we
want to optimize for Sharpe ratio.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.030
So, is this just a Sharpe ratio?

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.195
Well not exactly, because what
the minimizer will do, in this case,

00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:12.470
is try to find
the smallest Sharpe ratio.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.060
So it'll find allocations
that minimize that.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.570
And we want, of course,
the largest Sharpe ratio,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.450
because larger Sharpe ratios are better.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.007
That's easy to fix.

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:27.028
All we do is multiply
this by negative 1.

00:01:27.028 --> 00:01:34.230
So, all that we want our optimizer to do
is optimize for a negative Sharpe ratio.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.500
And that'll find the best allocation or
the best value for

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.220
x to solve this problem.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.260
And remember,
x can have multiple dimensions,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.300
so each dimension of x here is
an allocation to each of the stocks.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.990
So, if we're trying to solve for
a portfolio of four stocks,

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.660
x will have four dimensions, and
the value for each of those dimensions

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.750
is the percentage of funds to
allocate to each of those stocks.
