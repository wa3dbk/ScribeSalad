00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome back to CS215.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This the beginning of Unit 6, which is going to cover the hardness of network problems.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
All right, I made another magic trick and I'm going to show it to you now.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So this is a map of a country that used to be part of the old Soviet Union called Tetristan

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and it consist of 8 counties, which I've labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And what I'd like you to do is color the map each one with one of three colors

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so that no two counties that are touching show the same color

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and then I want you to number those colors--0, 1 and 2,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and then depending on which numbers you assigned to each colors

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and which colors you assigned to each counties, I want you to calculate the color of county D

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.000
plus the color of county F plus the color of county C times the color of county G

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
minus the color of county A plus the color of county H.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I want you to work out what that number is and then write it in this block,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but before you write it let me see if I can guess what it's going to be.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Yes--yes, I have a very good guess as to what it's going to be, but you write it in

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and let me make sure I'm right.
