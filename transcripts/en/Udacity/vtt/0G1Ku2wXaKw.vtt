00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Most of you probably ran into the Fibonacci sequence of numbers,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
named after filius Bonacci in a previous computer science class.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's a great way to teach recursion.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here I've written out a Python definition for the Fibonacci sequence.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
To get the Nth Fibonacci number, well, if N is less than or equal to 2,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we just return 1, otherwise, we return the sum of the 2 previous entries.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So we're going to get 1, 1, 2 -- 1 + 1 = 2.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
1 + 2 = 3.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
2 + 3 = 5.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
3 + 5 = 8.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
5 + 8 = 11. That sort of thing. Did I do that correctly? Let's imagine. [Laughs]

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
No, I totally didn't do that correctly. Man, you can't take me anywhere.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
[Singing--hmm, hmm, hmm] Basic math. Don't mind me. There we go.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This looks a lot better. You saw nothing.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Alright, so there's our Fibonacci sequence.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In an incredible surprise move, it actually shows up a lot in nature--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
for example, in the patterns of seeds in a sunflower or in the whirls in a clamshell

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or in yellow chamomile plants or all that good stuff.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
However, Fibonacci involves a huge amount of work.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's go see what goes on when we call Fibonacci.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm going to abbreviate it with an f--Fibonacci of 5.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Well, that's going to be based on Fibonacci of 4 and Fibonacci of 3.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now 4 is based on 3 and 2. 2 is a base case, so we're done. 3 is based on 2 and 1.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Over here, 3 is based on Fibonacci of 2 and Fibonacci of 1.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If you look carefully, a lot of these get repeated many times.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We end of calling Fibonacci of 2--once, twice, 3 times I called it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Similarly, Fibonacci of 3 is called multiple times.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We're redoing work.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We're computing the value of Fibonacci of 2 and Fibonacci of 3 over and over again.

00:01:48.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That is wasted work. We want to be lazy and avoid that.
