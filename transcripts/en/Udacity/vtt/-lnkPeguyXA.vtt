00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
So we showed in the last problem that it really depends on what time you want to minimize

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.130
whether you want to use n vans or 1 van, and so let's take a look at those two problems.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.720
First, we could minimize the time until all mails are delivered

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.910
or we could minimize the sum of the individual times taken by the vans.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.800
Now, what I'd like to know is whether minimizing either of these times is polynomial time solvable

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:36.520
or NP complete, and let's go ahead and say this is the case for n vans and an n vertex graph.

00:00:36.520 --> 99:59:59.000
And go ahead and check whichever is appropriate.
