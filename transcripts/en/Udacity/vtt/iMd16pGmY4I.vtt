Grant's girlfriend Gloria is super proud of Grant for all of his glasses viper

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.820
success. But she actually has a very successful as well. She's a wildlife

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.880
conservation specialist. In fact, she just got some really exciting news. She's

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.038
about to go to China for a couple of months to work at a giant panda sanctuary,

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:27.352
a nature preserve that protects pandas to help their population rebuild. Gloria

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:30.768
needs to learn all about how pandas became an endangered species, and how

00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:34.240
effective different conservation efforts have been, so that she can be as

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.799
helpful as possible during her time in China. Now, the preserve she's going to

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:45.150
has actually made a ton of progress in helping its panda population grow.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.930
Here's a graph showing how the number of pandas in the sanctuary has changed

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.540
form year to year. The horizontal axis here shows the number of years that have

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.764
passed since the opening of the sanctuary, and the vertical axis shows the

00:00:56.764 --> 00:01:01.952
number of pandas living there. How many pandas did the sanctuary start out

00:01:01.952 --> 00:01:07.296
with? In other words, how many did they have after 0 years? How many did they

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:13.742
have after 10 years? How about have 22 years? And lastly, what about after 30

00:01:13.742 --> 00:01:17.480
years? That's this last data point which represents now.
