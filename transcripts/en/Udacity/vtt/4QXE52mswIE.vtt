00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.727
I want to give you a taste of how materials can be represented in a more

00:00:02.727 --> 00:00:06.050
general way. You'll also learn a great term to impress your friends and

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.452
confound your enemies. Think about a surface and how it reflects light. The two

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:13.098
variables we use are the light's incoming direction and the amount of light

00:00:13.098 --> 00:00:17.506
reflecting towards the eye. So at it's simplest, a material can be represented

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:22.452
by this function,given a light and eye direction, give back an intensity. This

00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:25.990
function is called the BRDF which stands for Bidirectional Reflectance

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.732
Distribution Function. Let's look at that phrase. First, it's a function. The

00:00:30.732 --> 00:00:33.815
inputs are the light and the eye. The function depends on two directions so

00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:37.462
it's bidirectional. These directions are normally given with respect to the

00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:40.176
surface itself, that is, each vector is often given as two numbers, the

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:44.719
altitude angle and the azimuth. The altitude is the angle away from the normal,

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.335
and the azimuth is the angle of the vector when projected onto the plain. The

00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:52.735
phrase reflectance distribution means how the light is spread. One simple

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:56.047
example is a perfect mirror. The reflectance distribution in this case is that

00:00:56.047 --> 00:00:59.037
when the eyes direction is exactly equal to the lights reflection direction,

00:00:59.037 --> 00:01:03.412
all light is reflected towards the eye. Every other eye direction gets no

00:01:03.412 --> 00:01:07.062
light. Another basic distribution is diffuse reflection. For some given

00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:10.896
incoming light direction, the direction to the eye doesn't matter. That's the

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:14.198
definition of diffuse reflection. Since this value is constant, diffuse is then

00:01:14.198 --> 00:01:18.259
represented by the surface of a hemisphere. Specular highlights are represented

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.838
by lobes. This distribution represents a glossy surface, where light is

00:01:21.838 --> 00:01:25.767
reflected in a general direction. The lights direction determines where most of

00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:29.010
the lights energy is reflected. If the load gets wider, the specular

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.110
reflections spreads out. Written this way, our BRDF needs four numbers, two for

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.230
the light and two for the eye. But if you think about it, most materials really

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.580
only need three. These two altitude angles and this azimuth between them. For

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.713
example if you put a sheet of paper on a table top and rotate it. Both the

00:01:45.713 --> 00:01:48.898
light azimuth and eye azimuth angles change with respect to the paper, but the

00:01:48.898 --> 00:01:52.877
angle between the two remains the same. Most materials are fine with three

00:01:52.877 --> 00:01:53.520
numbers.
