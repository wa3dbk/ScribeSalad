00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:12.374

actually extends on and on forever,without any sort of pattern that repeats.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.930
This is different from any of the other kinds of numbers we've talked about so far, and

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:28.318
all of those numbers have been rational numbers. Now we need a different category, the rational numbers.
