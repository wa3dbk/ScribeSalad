00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.380
The addSeries method call is where we actually specify that we're going to

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.120
make a bar chart.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.720
A quirk of the addSeries method, that the first argument

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.120
specifies a field to create categories for the chart to group the data by.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.500
In this case, if we gave the method something like stage of each game,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.750
then we create a stacked bar chart, or whichever chart we specify where it

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.070
facets the data based on the field, that you pass in as the first argument.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.250
In this case, and we'll see in just a minute,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.340
if we specify stage, we'll actually be representing the attendance for

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.130
each stage of the World Cup for a given year.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.080
Since we want to first see the attendance across all games for

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.190
each year, we're going to pass in null,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.950
which just means to not group the data on any other field.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.160
The last step is to draw our chart and see all the hard work that Dimple has

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.300
done for us, here we just call the draw method on our myChart object,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.400
which we added all of our axises and the series to.
