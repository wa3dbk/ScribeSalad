00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now that we've mastered single character regular expressions,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
let's look into gluing them together.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We're going to need to find important bits of punctuation like slash greater than

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or equals equals, to reason about JavaScript and HTML and thus write our web browser.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Thus we really need the ability to concatenate or put right next to each other

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in repeat regular expressions.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Well, with regular expressions that's actually as simple as just writing,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
two regular expressions right next to each other.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This matches the string a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, and c2--six strings in all.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In each one, the first letter comes in the first regular expression,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and the second letters, 1 or 2, matches the second part of the regular expression.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We've concatenated a through c and 1 through 2 together to match more complicated strings.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You may have noticed that we suddenly had quite a few strings

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
from a relatively small regular expression.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In fact, if we 0 through 9 next to 0 through 9,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
there are a huge number of strings that we would match--100 in total.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Just as this matches 10 and this matches 10 when you put them together,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
you match 10-squared strings.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So let's look for a two-digit number in the string July 28, 1921.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Here is a two-digit number, here is a two-digit number, and here is another one.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We'll end up getting 28, 18, and 21.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now I'm looking for two-digit numbers in 12345--12 is a two-digit number,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
34 is a two-digit number, but 5 actually does not qualify.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This regular expression requires that both subparts be matched.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
July 28, 1821 is a good day for Peruvian Independence.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Let's brush up on matching these compound regular expressions.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Down here I've written a Python fragment

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
or Python program involving re.findall.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We're looking for a through z followed by 0 through 9 in this artificially constructed string

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
designed to be a bit tricky--a1 space 2b space cc3 space 44d.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm going to write out a bunch of possible answers, and I want you to tell me--

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
check all that apply which of the following are elements of the return value of this expression.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Here I've written nine possibilities.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.638
Check each one that's a member of the list that's return by this Python expression.
