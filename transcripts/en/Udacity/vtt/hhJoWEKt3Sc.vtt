Everyone goes through a period of figuring out who they're attracted to, and

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:07.321
who is attracted to them. Sexual identity involves figuring out who we are

00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:12.300
sexually, what we like and don't like, and who we're attracted to. Recent

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.260
surveys of American teens have reported that around 88% of teenagers describe

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.545
themselves as predominantly heterosexual. About 1 to 2%of teens describe

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:27.176
themselves as predominantly homosexual or bisexual. And about 10% of teens

00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:33.225
describe themselves as being confused about their sexual orientation. Now, the

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:36.965
formation of your identity also revolves around experimenting and trying other

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:41.495
adult type behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or doing drugs. As the

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:45.389
psychologist, Erik Erikson put it, being a teen involves forming our identity

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:52.364
in at least three main areas. Sexual, Ideological and occupational. We form our

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:57.555
identity through our relationships, that's the sexual part. Our political and

00:00:57.555 --> 00:01:02.056
religious beliefs, that's the ideological part. And through career choices,

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:06.191
that's the occupational part. To put it simply, being a teenager means trying

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:09.278
to figure out who we like, what we believe, and what career is best suited for

00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:10.670
us.
