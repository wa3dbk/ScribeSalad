00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.500
We have an app which has
a list of friends and

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.220
you can add those friends to the shared
list here just by clicking this button.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.460
And you can also remove them.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.450
Pretty cool.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.970
So, it looks like we're effectively
keeping track of who is shared on

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.770
what lists.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.400
So now it's time to actually
change around the user lists

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.560
to add shopping lists when
they're shared with the user.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.380
This is a fairly complicated task.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.740
So here's some thoughts that I
had about how to break it down.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.030
My recommendation is that the first
thing you should do is to add or

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.340
remove a list to a users list.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.630
So when you press the plus button.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.370
And becomes green.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.650
You should actually take that list and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.660
add it to the user list of
the friend that you're sharing with.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.010
Conversely, if you press
the green check to unshare it.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.960
To remove the list from
your friend's user lists.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.610
Also, a quick reminder,
whenever you're changing around who's

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.265
shared on the list, it should update the
timestamp last changed for all users.

00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:51.010
Okay, so once you've got that working,
you can change or update map for

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.430
all with value to update the lists for
all shared users.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.370
Right now, it's doing it pretty
effectively for the owner but you should

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.310
have this method also update for
anybody that's on the shared with list.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.650
For updateMapForAllWithValue to actually
be able to do this, you might need to

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.490
change the signature to include
passing in a shared with list.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.310
And since you're probably going to be
changing around that method signature,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.980
you're also going to want to update
all the places that you call

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.050
updateMapForAllWithValue.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.370
So that you can pass in
that shared with list.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.730
You might find that you're calling
this method from Adapters and Dialogs.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.870
And that gets a little bit more tricky.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.790
Let me give you some tips.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.260
For Adapters, you could set a list
of shared users much like you said

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.570
a shopping list in an Adapter.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.860
Let me show you in the code.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.910
In ActiveListItemAdapter of
a ShoppingList member variable.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.330
And that shopping list member variable
is actually set here with this

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.950
setShoppingList method.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.860
Okay, so now if I go over to
active list details activity,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.720
I'm here in the onCreate method and
a lot of stuff happens.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.230
I'm scrolling down.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.130
But, one of the things is I get
a listener that grabs the shopping list.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.490
So it's the activity shopping
list member variable.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.570
And then passes in the shopping
list into the adapter.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.110
So you could do something kind
of similar in the activity.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.640
You can grab, in the activity,
you can grab the shared with list.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.800
And then when that changes you
can pass that into the adapter.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.680
Dialogs are similarly
a little bit tricky.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.850
Now, you can pass in these shared
users into a new instance method,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.970
much like you would a primitive value.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.160
But shared users is a hash map,
and, if you remember,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.060
in the new instance methods,we're
putting all those values into a bundle.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.660
So, you might be wondering how
to put a hash map into a bundle,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.440
well you can use Bundle's handy
dandy put Serializable method.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.830
And similarly you can pull it out of
the bundle by using Bundle's handy dandy

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.580
get Serializable method.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.850
You just have to remember to
also cast it to hash map.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.900
All right so I'm not going to lie,
this is a pretty big update.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.260
But I know you're ready for it.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.070
Read the spec carefully,
work incrementally, and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.470
reach out if you need help.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.430
I'll also go ahead and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.490
add a link to adding log level debugging
information in the instructor notes.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.780
Okay, best of luck and
I'll send over the spec right now.
