00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.290
Because a Service Worker runs in
the background, they have a different

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.810
life cycle, which is completely
separate from your Web page.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.577
And In order to use a Service Worker,

00:00:08.577 --> 00:00:12.130
it needs to be registered
by your app's JavaScript.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.500
If the page has never had a Service
Worker before, or the Service Worker has

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.990
been updated, the browser gets the new
service worker and installs it.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.490
Once it's been installed,
it's then activated.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.880
The Service Worker will then control
all the pages under the scope,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.320
with one exception.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.960
The page that is registered for
the Service Worker for

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.160
the first time, won't be controlled
until it's loaded again.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.210
Once the Service Worker is in control,
it will handle fetch,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.540
message, and push events that occur
whenever a network request or

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.990
message is sent from your page.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.320
Note that a browser can terminate
a Service Worker to save memory.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.460
But it will be restarted as needed.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.840
