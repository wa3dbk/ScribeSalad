00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now that we know how to reliably solve differential equations, we can return to rockets.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What make things easy is that we're going to fire the rocket only for seconds, not for minutes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Think of what would happen if you could give the spacecraft an ultra-short but ultra-strong boost

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that would lead to an instantaneous change of the velocity.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
After that of course, also the position changes.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We have different trajectory but the only thing that we need to take account of

00:00:27.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to incorporate that boost is to change the velocity.
