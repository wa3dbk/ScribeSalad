00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.920
This entire course, I'm going to focus
on the problem of classification.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.480
Classification is the task of taking
an input, like this letter, and

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.760
giving it a label that says,
this is a B.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.230
The typical setting is that
you have a lot of examples,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.570
called the training set,
that I've already been sorted in.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.730
This is an A, this is a B, and so on.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.980
Now, here's a completely new example.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.140
And your goal is going to be to
figure out which of those classes

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.482
it belongs to.

00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:32.930
There is a lot more to machine
learning that just classification.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.650
But classification, or

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.360
marginally prediction, is the central
building block of machine learning.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.580
Once you know how to classify things,
it's very easy, for

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.650
example, to learn how to detect them,
or to rank them.
