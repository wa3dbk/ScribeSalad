00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.510
Ever since the pioneering work of
Turing and his contemporaries, such as

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.720
Alonzo Church and Kurt Gödel, mathematic
logicians have studied the power of

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.010
computation and connecting it to prove
ability, as well as giving us new

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.365
insights on the nature of information,
even philosophy and economics.

00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:22.170
Computability has a downside,
just because we can solve a problem on

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.930
a Turing machine, doesn't mean
that we can solve it quickly.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.300
What good is having
a computer solve a problem,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.420
if our sun explodes before
we get to the answer?

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.210
So for now we'll leave the study of
computable functions and languages, and

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.570
move to computational complexity.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.580
Trying to understand the power
of efficient computation.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.260
And learning about the famous
P verses NP question.
