00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.290
Now, how do we display it?

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.910
This is the image I got,
captures a lot more gory detail.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.080
It's no longer from 0 to 255.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.600
What I want, of course, is an image
that can be still displayed because

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.010
displays also have the same constraints
as cameras and printers do that.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.670
I still need to be able to put up
colors between 0 to 255 for each and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.120
every one of the channel's RGB.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.210
So this is what we want out of it.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.060
Just to zoom in,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.660
here is the image that you should now
actually have the details here, right?

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.530
You can see details of the painting.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.119
They're all well lit.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.060
You can see the snow outside and
it's well lit outside.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.680
You can even see, for example,
the umbrella outside in detail but

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.200
you can also see details of the floor
and everything else like that.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.690
I personally love this
image it's it's a nice,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.950
of course, background and backdrop.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.180
We'll be making these
example images available for

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.120
you to play around with too.
