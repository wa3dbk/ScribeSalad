00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:08.066
If T equals the half-life, this vector has to be one half, so that the number of particles remaining is half of

00:00:08.067 --> 00:00:18.766
the initial number of particles. So we get this equation: E to the minus half-life divided by 20 seconds,

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:27.299
equals one half. And now you take the natural logarithm on both sides and get minus half-life,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.698
divided by 20 seconds, equals the natural logarithm of one half.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.366
You bring over the minus and the 20 seconds to the right-hand side, and what you get is the half life is

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:44.366
minus 20 seconds times the natural logarithm of one half.

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:48.299
So this one is correct. But that's not the only one that's correct.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:58.999
The next one is two. If you found the logarithm of an inverse, you get minus the logarithm of that number.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.599
Remember, if you form an inverse, one over A, that would be E to the minus B.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.632
So the logarithm of the inverse is minus B.

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:15.699
If the logarithm of the number as such is plus B.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:24.466
These two yield the same result. The last one can't be true because it has a different sign than the one before, which is correct.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:28.932
In the first one we're dividing by a number that's smaller than one.

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:34.132
So we get something that's larger than 20 seconds, which can't be true, because we know that the lifetime,

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:37.900
20 seconds, has to be larger than the half-life.
