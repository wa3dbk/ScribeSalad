00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.390
In the previous examples we looked
at systems of equations that had

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.710
a unique solution.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.020
However, as we've seen,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.070
it's not always the case that there
is a unique solution to every system.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.270
We need the Gaussian elimination
procedure to be robust against these

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.270
cases.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.661
Let's look at the following system.

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:20.964
x + 2y + 3z = 1, 3x + 2y +

00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:26.080
z = 0, 7x + 6y + 5z = 2.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.160
We can start solving
the system as usual,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.310
clearing the terms
beneath the top x term.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:40.719
Subtract three times the first equation
from the second to get -4y- 8z = -3.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.567
And then subtract seven
times the first equation

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:50.188
from the third, to get -8y- 16z = -5.

00:00:50.188 --> 00:00:53.301
Then we drop down to
the second equation and

00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:56.380
start to clear the y terms beneath -4y.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.004
Subtract two times the second
equation from the third, and

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:02.770
now we're in a very
interesting situation.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.981
There is nothing remaining on the left
hand side of the third equation, but

00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:13.550
there is a one remaining on the right
hand side, giving us the equation 0 = 1.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.320
What does this mean?

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.102
Well, the original system of equations
assumes that there are numbers x,

00:01:20.102 --> 00:01:24.110
y, and z,
which satisfy the three simultaneously.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.890
Since we used legal operations
on the original system and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.840
obtained a false statement, it means
that these supposed numbers x, y,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.630
and z, which satisfy the system,
must not exist.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.850
In other words, this contradiction tells
us that the system is inconsistent.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.480
It has no solutions.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.260
In fact, if we ever run into the case
that the left hand side of an equation

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.540
is zero and the right hand side is
not zero, we can immediately stop and

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.240
say that the system has no solutions.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.980
This is a nice criterion for
finding systems with no solutions.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.730
But what about systems with
more than one solution?

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.180
This is a bit trickier.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.343
Let's modify the system from
before just a little bit,

00:02:07.343 --> 00:02:11.128
making the constant term in the third
equation one instead of two.

00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:15.459
Again, we start by subtracting three
times the first equation from the second

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.673
and continue by subtracting seven times
the first equation from the third.

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:25.690
The third equation now reads,
-8y- 16z = -6.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.980
Now as before, subtract two times
the second equation from the third,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.420
unlike last time, the bottom
equation is not a contradiction.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.740
Certainly zero equals zero.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.270
So what are we to make of this?

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.790
Well since zero always equal zero,
regardless of what X, Y, and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.110
Z are,
the last equation becomes redundant.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.920
The system would have the exact same
solution if we dropped it all together.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.870
This is how to interpret an equation
of the form zero equals zero,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.360
the row it occupies was
originally a redundant equation.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.300
It gives no extra information
about the solutions that was

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.680
not contained in the equations above it.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.570
In fact, notice that in the original
system, if we added the first equation

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.720
to two times the second equation,
we would get the third equation.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.180
So what do we do now?

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.180
The system essentially has
only two planes in it,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.710
meaning that the solution
cannot be a single point,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.440
since the planes aren't parallel, the
solution is that will be a line in fact.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.060
Is there anything else we can do?

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.910
Yes, like we did with lines earlier,

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.760
we can parameterize the solution set,
in other words, we can describe

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.550
all the points in the solution set as
a function of some number of parameters.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.980
How can we do this?

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.540
First after dropping the zero
equals zero equation,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.820
notice that we cannot clear
terms downward anymore.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.270
Instead what we will do is identify
what are called pivot variables.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.880
These are variables whose values will
be determined by the values of the non

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.350
pivot or free variables.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.900
The pivot variables are the variables
which are leading terms in our equations

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.750
in this case X and Y are leading terms.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.680
So they are the pivot variables.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.050
Since Z is not a leading term
in any of the equations,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.870
it will be a free variable.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.345
Since Z is a free variable,

00:04:10.345 --> 00:04:14.000
it will become a parameter in our
parametrization of the solution set.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.940
Now let's continue our Gaussian
elimination algorithm.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.610
So we can end up with the
parametrization of the solution set of

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.519
our system.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.910
In the second equation.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.710
In order to make the pivot variable
have a coefficient equal one,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.430
multiply through by negative one fourth.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.040
The equation now reads y + 2z = 3/4.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.690
Then like we normally do
in Gaussian elimination,

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.030
we will clear the terms
above the leading y term.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.700
So we subtract two times the second
equation from the first.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.290
This gives us x- z = -1/2
in the first equation.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.090
Since the leading coefficient
of each equation is now one and

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.840
the leading variables only
appear in one equation each,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.540
we have simplified the system
as much as possible.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.030
This form is called reduced
row-echelon form, or rref for short.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.430
We can now parametrize the solution
set in the following way.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.280
Suppose xyz is a point in
the solution set, then x

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.850
will have to equal -1/2+z by
rearranging this top equation.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.020
Similarly, by rearranging
the second equation we see that

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.410
y has to equal 3/4- 2z.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.590
Finally since z is a free variable,
we set it equal to itself.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.650
This means that for every real value of
z, this point is in the solution set.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.250
Another way we can write this is
to split the vector into a sum

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.480
of a constant vector and
a vector with a z term.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.230
This form should be familiar.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.060
It is how we parameterized
the line previously,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.640
except now we're using z instead
of t for the parameter name.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.447
The base point of this
parameterization is negative one-half,

00:05:53.447 --> 00:05:58.280
three-fourths, zero, and the direction
vector of this parameterization is one,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.820
negative two, one.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.380
Here are some different points
that are in the solution set

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.260
that we can generate by
picking different values of z.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.060
Picking z=0 gives us the basepoint.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.590
Regardless of the value of z
that is picked, we can check

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.520
that the point will be a solution to
the original system of equations.
