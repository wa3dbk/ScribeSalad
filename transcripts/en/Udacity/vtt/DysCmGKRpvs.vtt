00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.070
One of the most exciting parts of this
machine learning engineer nano degree

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.890
program is that for the very first
time we are able to leverage

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.430
some of the materials that we've
produced as part of our partnership with

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.862
Georgia Tech on their online Master's
and Computer Science program.

00:00:10.862 --> 00:00:14.370
You're going to be hearing from the same
videos, the same professors that teach

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.160
graduate level machine learning
at Georgia Tech right now.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.110
You'll hear form Charles Isbell on
Michael Litman on the major schools of

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.090
thought on machine learning
like reinforcement learning and

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.906
supervised learning.

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:27.331
You'll hear from Goyle and I about
the more kindly oriented side of AI,

00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:29.720
a different perspective
of what AI can do.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.759
You'll also cover some classes
on applied machine learning,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.150
specifically to certain domains
like trading and healthcare.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.940
Now because these classes were produced
for the Georgia Tech online Masters

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.970
degree, they have their own learning
goals and we're using them in a way

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.330
that's a little bit different from
how they were originally produced.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.580
So you might feel like it's
a little bit chaotic sometimes.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.870
We'll try and
step in from time to time and

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.690
set the expectations and remind you
of what our learning goals are.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.990
But we just wanted to let you know that
if you feel like it's a little bit

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.440
disjointed at times, that's intentional.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.560
That kind of comes with the territory of
using the material that's been produced

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.080
for this master's program like this.
