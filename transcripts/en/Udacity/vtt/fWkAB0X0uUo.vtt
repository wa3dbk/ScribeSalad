00:00:00.158 --> 00:00:04.271
The way to do that is what we call a "procedure."

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:08.372
A procedure is something that takes inputs in--

00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:10.550
there can be more than one--

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.765
does some work on those inputs;

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:16.891
and produces outputs as results.

00:00:16.952 --> 00:00:20.271
The idea of a procedure is a very powerful idea.

00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:22.818
This allows us to use a small amount of code

00:00:22.818 --> 00:00:24.508
to do many different things.

00:00:24.508 --> 00:00:27.131
We can have the same code operate on different inputs.

00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:30.994
Whatever we pass in as inputs to the procedure

00:00:30.994 --> 00:00:33.032
will be what that code operates on--

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.460
and it can do different things depending on those inputs--

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.260
and it produces outputs that tell us the result,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.132
based on the inputs that we passed in.

00:00:40.132 --> 00:00:42.466
You've seen things very similar to procedures

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.693
in the previous unit.

00:00:44.693 --> 00:00:46.664
You saw the built-in operators--

00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:48.521
operators like "+."

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:50.766
"+" took two numbers as its inputs,

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.946
and, as its output,

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:55.899
it produced the sum of those two numbers.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.486
Because it's a built-in operator,

00:00:57.486 --> 00:00:59.284
it's a little different from a procedure--

00:00:59.284 --> 00:01:03.026
the syntax that we use for it is different because it's a built-in operator--

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:06.558
but, in terms of being something that abstractly operates on different inputs

00:01:06.558 --> 00:01:08.560
and produces the corresponding output,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.417
it's very much the same idea.

00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:12.821
What we're going to learn in this unit,

00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:14.777
is how to make our own procedures.

00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:16.979
Python provides a construct for doing that,

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.710
and the grammar is to have the keyword "def"--

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.843
that's short for "define"--

00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:23.643
followed by a name.

00:01:23.643 --> 00:01:26.504
And the name of a procedure is just like the name of a variable.

00:01:26.504 --> 00:01:29.283
It can be any string that starts with a letter,

00:01:29.283 --> 00:01:32.765
can be followed by letters and numbers and underscores.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:34.741
Anything that we could use as a variable,

00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:37.228
we can use as the name of a procedure.

00:01:37.228 --> 00:01:39.294
Then there's a left paren "("

00:01:39.294 --> 00:01:40.362
the left paren is very important--

00:01:40.378 --> 00:01:42.618
that's what makes it a procedure--

00:01:42.618 --> 00:01:45.968
and after the left paren we have a list of parameters.

00:01:45.968 --> 00:01:50.432
"Parameters" is just a fancy name for the inputs to the procedure.

00:01:50.432 --> 00:01:53.084
After that, there's a colon ":"

00:01:53.084 --> 00:01:56.290
This is what says we're making a procedure--

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.481
it has this name;

00:01:58.481 --> 00:01:59.472
it takes these inputs.

00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:01.705
Then what we have to do is actually define the code.

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:04.294
So, what follows that is a "block"--

00:02:04.294 --> 00:02:07.122
and a "block" is just a sequence of statements,

00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:09.720
the code that we want to run,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.754
as the body of the procedure.

00:02:11.754 --> 00:02:13.290
What the inputs are

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.128
is just a list of names, separated by commas.

00:02:17.128 --> 00:02:19.129
We can have as many inputs as we want.

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.972
There could be no inputs.

00:02:20.972 --> 00:02:24.948
In that case, what the parameters would look like is just two parens

00:02:24.948 --> 00:02:26.606
with nothing between them - "()"

00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:29.714
There could be one input.

00:02:29.714 --> 00:02:30.239
In that case, we'd have a paren, followed by a name,

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.609
followed by a closed paren.

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:33.917
Or there could be many inputs;

00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:35.855
in which case, we'd have a paren,

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.454
followed by the name of the first input,

00:02:37.454 --> 00:02:39.522
followed by the name of the second input,

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:41.723
followed by the name of the third,

00:02:41.723 --> 00:02:43.856
followed by as many inputs as we want.

00:02:43.856 --> 00:02:45.522
So, we could have five inputs,

00:02:45.522 --> 00:02:48.129
give them the names "a," "b," "c," "d," "e."

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.866
This is not a good idea, usually,

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:52.080
to give our parameters meaningless names;

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.229
that makes it hard to remember what they are

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.241
when we use them in the code that we write as the "block."

00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:59.798
We're much better off having parameters with names like "page"

00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:02.612
that remind us what they mean.

00:03:02.612 --> 00:03:04.429
The body of the procedure is the "block."

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:08.337
This is the code that runs to execute the procedure.

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:11.982
The "block" is indented inside the definition.

00:03:11.982 --> 00:03:13.979
Usually we like to use four spaces--

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:15.552
that's just the convention in Python,

00:03:15.552 --> 00:03:18.519
and that makes it easy for people to see and read the code--

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.460
but all the lines in the "block" have to be indented the same amount.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.148
That's how the interpreter knows

00:03:23.148 --> 00:03:25.235
that we've got to the end of the procedure,

00:03:25.235 --> 00:04:57.000
when we get to some code that's not indented anymore.
