00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.499
So the answer is whether or not, you can see methods that are defined in the

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:08.895
superclass of DiscerningBear, which is GrizzlyBear. For sobj1 you can see

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:14.020
attributes defined by GrizzlyBear. For sobj2, you can't, because you don't use

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.354
any attributes defined in this class. An easy way to see that is to look at

00:00:18.354 --> 00:00:22.648
knock<u>down</u>tree method, which is defined in the GrizzlyBear class. When we use

00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:26.864
super passing into DiscerningBear, that method exists and it does what it should

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:30.929
do. Timber! What do we think, we'll get when we looked at for the knocked down

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.162
tree attribute for the sobj that results from calling in super passing in

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:38.605
GrizzlyBear. Well that attribute does not exist because it's not defined by any

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:40.220
super class of grizzly bear
