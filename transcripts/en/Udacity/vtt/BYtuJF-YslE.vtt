00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.666
Let's see how to write the two absolute value functions from the last quiz as

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:08.970
piecewise functions, this is just like we did earlier on in the lesson. This

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.390
time however, I'd like you to fill in both the function pieces and the

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.379
corresponding parts of the domain.
