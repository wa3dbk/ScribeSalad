00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.750
The way that you build a portfolio, or

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.900
buy stocks that you hold in your
portfolio, is by issuing orders.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.140
Usually you send those orders
to a stock broker, and

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.980
they take care of executing them for
you.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.550
We're going to dive now into
the details of what happens

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.460
when you create an order, and
how it gets to the market and back.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.810
And how things can go wrong, and
how they can potentially go right.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.950
The first stop there is to think
about what is actually in an order.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.820
What are the components of an order
that can go to a stock exchange?

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.970
Here is all the information that
must go into a well-formed order.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.380
First of all,
I need to know are you looking to buy or

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.910
sell shares of a stock?

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.120
Next is the symbol.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.900
This is an identifier for the stock or
perhaps ETF that you want to buy or

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.810
sell, for instance IBM or SPLV.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.970
Next you need to tell your broker how
many shares you want to buy or sell.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.860
Stocks and ETFs and

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.770
other assets are sold in units of
shares, not by amount of money.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.570
So you don't tell your broker I
want $100,000 worth of Apple,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.750
you tell your broker I want
a thousand shares of Apple.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.680
Next, you need to tell your broker
whether this is a limit order or

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.910
a market order.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.030
Let's start with market first,
market means you're willing to accept

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.280
a good price but essentially whatever
price the market is currently bearing.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.310
And I'll show you in a moment
how that's determined.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.900
A limit price means you don't want to
do any worse than a certain price.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.630
For instance,
suppose you're selling some stock.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.720
You might specify I don't want it to
be sold below a particular price.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.790
Or if you're buying stock,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.840
you might say, I don't want to pay
more than a certain amount to get it.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.000
If you're issuing a limit order,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.510
then you have to say what
the corresponding price is.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.950
If it's a market order,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.210
you're not able to specify that price
because essentially when you issue

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.250
the market order you're saying I'll
take whatever price comes back.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.780
Let's take a look at
a couple example orders.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.560
Here's one.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.850
Buy IBM, 100 shares, limit, 99.95.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.025
So this means I want to buy 100
shares of IBM at no more than $99.95.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.430
Another example, sell Google,
150 shares, market.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.890
Notice there's no price
with this because

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.260
we're going to take whatever
the market price is.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.870
So let's look at what happens when
these orders reach the exchange.
