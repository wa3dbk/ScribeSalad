00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.760
And now that we have our years in addition to our update function,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.630
let's put them together in setInterval.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.380
The syntax for

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.910
setInterval is that the first argument it expects is a function to run.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.590
And the second argument is the number of milliseconds for

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.510
the interval to run at.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.910
So for this example we'll run this anonymous function every second or

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.500
every 1,000 milliseconds starting one second from when set interval gets called.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.630
And the way to stop an interval, so it doesn't go on forever, is to remember in

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.310
a variable, what interval you set, and inside our function for the interval.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.280
We need to put our code that runs the update function and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.460
pass it one year at a time.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.700
In our code here, we're creating an index, so we know which year we're at.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.105
Inside our function is called at the specified setInterval of

00:00:53.105 --> 00:00:54.932
1,000 milliseconds.

00:00:54.932 --> 00:00:59.080
We're running our update function with the specified index

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.340
to get the correct year from our years array and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.310
running update with that year incrementing the index by 1.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.430
And then if the index happens to be greater than then number of

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.390
elements in our years array, meaning we've going to through every year,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.790
past the year interval, the JavaScript function clearInterval.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.680
ClearInterval is simply a built in JavaScript function,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.750
that takes as a single argument, an interval variable created with setInterval.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.220
And stops it so that we don't run for

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.500
ever, update after update of the World Cup map.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.780
To make this a little bit more clear, calling setInterval,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.150
it returns an interval object which we're remembering in our year_interval

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.780
variable which we then are going to pass to clearInterval to stop or

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.140
function from getting called every 1,000 milliseconds.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.910
And now let's save our file and go back to our browser and

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.100
see how our map animates.
