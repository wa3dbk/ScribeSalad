00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.510
Now let's try to figure out Tomasulo timing on our own. Suppose we

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.160
have a processor with these latencies. A load takes one cycle to execute,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.150
an add takes one cycle, and a multiply takes five cycle. Suppose that

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.550
the latencies of instruction execution are load one cycle, add one cycle, and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.230
multiply five cycles. Suppose we also have this number of reservation stations.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.610
We have one load reservation station, two add, and two multiply reservation

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.670
stations. And finally, we need to know what's allowed in the same cycle. And for

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.930
that, issuing and then dispatching instruction in the same cycle is not allowed.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.110
Capturing the upper end and then dispatching the instruction in

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.120
the same cycle is not allowed in this processor. And finally,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.060
if a reservation station is freed, it cannot be used in the same cycle again for

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.590
another instruction. So once we free a reservation station,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.530
it only becomes eligible for issuing another instruction in the next cycle.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.580
These are the instructions we have. And what we need to now do is figure out

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.587
the timing for them, when do they share dispatch and write. To get you started,

00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:16.410
these four instructions will issue in cycles one, two, three, and four.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.860
This quiz has two parts. Part one is for you to figure out for

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.190
this four instructions that issue in cycles one, two, three, and four. When do

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.160
they dispatch for each one of them and when does each of them write it's result?
