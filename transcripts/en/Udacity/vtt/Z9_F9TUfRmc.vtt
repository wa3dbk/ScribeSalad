00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.687
So let's think about the maximum number of iterations that we might have.

00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:06.209
What graph is going to give us the most iterations?

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:10.266
And that graph is going to be this awful looking linear chain.

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.525
How many iterations is that going to have?

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:15.526
Well it's going to have on the order of V iterations,

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:18.189
because we are going to have V vertices here.

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.752
And how much work are we going to do in each one of those iterations?

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:26.271
Well each one of these iterations, we know that we will visit all E edges,

00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:30.238
so if we take the amount of work here as a product between V and E,

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:35.165
we know that our final answer is going to be on the order of V times E,

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:37.882
so we know that it's at least going to be on the order of V,

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:40.143
and we know that it's at least going to be in the order of E.

00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:42.561
Probably in any reasonable graph,

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:47.001
there's going to be more edges than vertices; otherwise, it's not a very interesting graph,

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:53.938
and if that's the case, we know that the overall work complexity is going to be at least order of V squared.

00:00:53.938 --> 00:00:58.043
It's quadratic in the number of vertices, and that's bad.

00:00:58.043 --> 00:01:00.252
That is a very bad property.

00:01:00.252 --> 00:01:02.781
And so I told you in the beginning of the discussion here

00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:05.281
that this was a crummy algorithm and this is why.

00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:11.162
We really do not want an algorithm that is quadratic in the number of vertices.
