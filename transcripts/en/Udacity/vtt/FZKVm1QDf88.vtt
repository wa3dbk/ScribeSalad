The problem is that we don't want to stop when the balance is exactly equal to

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:07.811
the target. We want to stop as soon as the balance hits the target. So if the

00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:11.818
balance is less than the target, we keep growing. And if the balance equals the

00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:13.590
target or is more, we stop.
