00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.368
We just said that we can translate this inequality as the distance between x and

00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:08.501
4 on a number line is less than 5. Let's mark 4. Try to use this number line to

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:12.778
visualize where you think x is allowed to lie. Considering what we know about

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:17.147
how far it can be from 4. Then write down the interval form of the solution, and

00:00:17.147 --> 00:00:21.153
also the inequality form of the solutions for, for x. So again, first just

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:24.865
figure out the range of solution on the number line that you think x is allowed

00:00:24.865 --> 00:00:28.577
to equal, and then just translate this into the 2 types of notation we know how

00:00:28.577 --> 00:00:29.032
to use.
