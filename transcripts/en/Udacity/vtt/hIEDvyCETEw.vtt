00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let me summarize, you've actually learned quite a bit.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You learned about probability of an event, such as the outcome of a coin flip.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You learned that the probability of the opposite event is 1 minus the probability of the event.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And you learned about the probability of a composite event,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which was in the form P * P …. P.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Technically speaking, this thing over here is called independence,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which means nothing else, but that the outcome of the second coin flip

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
didn't really depend on the outcome of the first coin flip.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In our next unit, we will talk about dependence

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
where there are bizarre dependencies between different outcomes.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But for the time being, you really managed to get a very basic understanding of probability.

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.999
So, let's take the next unit and let's jointly dive much deeper into the rabbit hole of probability.
