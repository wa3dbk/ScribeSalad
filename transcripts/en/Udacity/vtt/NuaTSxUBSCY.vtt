00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Alright, let's go through a possible answer together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
To see if there's an outgoing edge, we'll just check to see if the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
tuple (current, letter) is in edges.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If so, our destination state can be obtained by just looking up

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the tuple (current, letter) in edges.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We've already processed letter, the 0th element of string,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so we want to peel off the 0th character, retaining only the rest of them.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
For example, if the input was "aaa111", we've used the "a",

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so now we want it to be just "aa111".

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now we just call ourselves recursively, call finite state machine simulation

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
on the remaining string, starting from the destination node,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and the edges and accepting states are unchanged.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Otherwise, we fall off the finite state machine and return false.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Alright. The moment of truth.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We want to print out this answer.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Oh! Just as we expected, "aaa111" is accepted by this string.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What if I try to mix it up and make it something like "a1a1a1"?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This should not be accepted by our finite state machine,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and it is not. The output changes to false.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
How about the empty string? Is that accepted?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's not because we're looking for "a+1+" so this should also be false.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And it is, but how about the smallest string we do accept, "a1"?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That one is accepted. Great!

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So we can check any finite state machine to see if it accepts a string.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You may have noticed as we were going through it,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that edges and accepting never change.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I defined them once at the beginning of the file.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So our finite state machine simulator is really just recursive in the input and the current state,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and that matches our intuition because those are the 2 fingers I was using

00:01:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to work it out on paper.
