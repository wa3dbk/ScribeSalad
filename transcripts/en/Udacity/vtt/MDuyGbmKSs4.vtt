00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.930
Great job.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.500
At this point we're completely done with our exploration of

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.920
different versions of the object decorator pattern.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.370
Generally, you would use the decorator pattern to add some functionality to

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.160
an object that already had some functionality in it at that point.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.329
But our example is so simple that we just find ourselves passing in

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.330
an empty object to the carlike decorator.
