00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.899
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A times b is negative 6, and a plus b is positive 5. Now again, I like to

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.218
start off with the multiplication bit. 3 and 2 don't work again here, because

00:00:08.218 --> 00:00:12.305
we'd have to have one of them negative, one of them positive, and then they

00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:16.411
wouldn't add to 5 anymore. But, what if this time we try negative 1 times

00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:21.539
positive 6, instead of negative 6 times positive 1. 6 minus 1 is 5, so that

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.251
works. So a and b must be negative 1 and 6, either way around. So we'll have x

00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:30.236
minus 1 times x plus 6.
