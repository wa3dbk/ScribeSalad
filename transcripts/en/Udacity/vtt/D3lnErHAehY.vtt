00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let me just re-transform this as is done over here--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
x1 minus x2 is now +4, and x2 minus x1 is -4.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I have to add +1 over here, -1 over there,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
+1 in this diagonal element over here, and -1 over here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Let me just do this.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
These numbers added in transform the first number over here to 2.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We get a -1 for the off-diagonal elements, and then 1 over here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now we add 4 to the 5, which gives us a 9, and a -4 to the 0 gives -4.

00:00:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is where we are now.
