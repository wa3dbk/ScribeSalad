00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
The solution here is that you can also find 4 vertices that form an independent set.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.500
This one here is rather obvious. You can also take this one in there, this one here.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.850
It's not connected to any of the other ones and this one here.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.410
Well, I've already placed the vertices in very similar locations, but as you can see,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.860
each vertex here has a corresponding vertex in the independent set, and of course,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.610
the way I've drawn this is not really by accident.

00:00:25.610 --> 99:59:59.000
There's a certain type of relationship between this network here and this network here.
