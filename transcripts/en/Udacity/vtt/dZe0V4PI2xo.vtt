00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
Let's do a little quiz here.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.220
What is true for any valid--and by valid I mean with respect to independent set--

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.350
any valid 0, 1 assignment to the vertices v and u if they are connected by an edge?

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.370
Is it that at most, 1 of the 2 vertices can be in the independent set--

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.490
and I'm going to write independent set as IS here just to not move out of the screen here.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.330
Is it that both v and u can be in the independent set?

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.130
Is it that at least 1 of the 2 vertices must be in the independent set

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.650
because we're looking for the largest possible independent set?

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.660
Could it be that although we're looking for the largest possible independent set,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.010
they are both not contained in that independent set?

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.860
And finally here, because both vertices are connected by an edge,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.170
is it the case that we would have to exclude both of these vertices

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.990
from the independent set?

00:00:49.990 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check each one of those here that are correct.
