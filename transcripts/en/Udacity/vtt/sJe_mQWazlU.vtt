00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.010
Don, I want to start off by thanking you
for taking the time to be with us today.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.300
I know the students are going to learn
an awful lot by hearing from you,

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.600
and I know you're very busy so
I really appreciate it.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.220
&gt;&gt; My pleasure.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.760
I wish we could share a glass
of wine at the same time, but

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.610
anyway, we'll proceed.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.270
&gt;&gt; Well if we can figure
out how to do that you and

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.940
I will probably get very rich.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.650
&gt;&gt; Well, we've got a lot of wine
up here in Charlotteville, so

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.840
I always try to help the locals.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.350
&gt;&gt; Yes you do.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.330
So, Don you've been a thought
leader in informatics for years.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.190
You've chaired most of the important
IOM Reports that I've alluded to

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.060
throughout the course, so
you have a unique perspective.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.760
Where do you think we are today on
transforming our health care system,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.550
particularly through
the use of health IT?

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.060
And what are your hopes for the future?

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.420
&gt;&gt; Well, it's really been exciting
to have been involved in this.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.400
I guess the only thing that's
frustrating is that I'm

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.150
not getting younger because I
think it still has to play out.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.250
But we are really I think
making terrific progress.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.540
When you consider that the 1991 report
on a computer based patient record

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.820
was called an essential technology for
health care and that it took

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.720
until just 2009 for
the high tech legislation to really

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.090
make this a national kind of development
with meaningful use and so forth.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.210
So clearly, these have been
really momentous times, and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.110
it's exciting to me to see that we
are way past the early majority.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.660
We're into the late majority
of people now doing this

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.280
both in hospitals and practices.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.480
So having said that, I don't know if
you saw, I can send you the reference.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.500
But I had a paper with a couple
colleagues this years.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.380
The way it was finally broken,
where are we now,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.710
that spoke to some of the issues.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.970
And there are a lot of issues out there.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.200
There's not the interoperability
that we need.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.440
There's not the functionality that
we need from the point of view of

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.680
even physicians, let alone all
the other members of the health team.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.590
So it's a glass half full,
half empty kind of thing.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.590
But actually I think it's
really in a good spot.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.920
Some of where we are though is,
of course,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.240
we mostly have been using health IT
in terms of say computer technology.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.230
And I think increasingly now we're
using communications technology.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.310
And all these things are new,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.540
from the time the study was done and
it moved forward.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.750
So, we're always going to be
in the situation of trying to

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.030
both keep up with where
the technology and opportunities go.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.630
But a lot of progress has been made, and
I think what I'm excited about, to talk

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.620
about also, is where some of the pinch
points are and where we can go next.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.270
&gt;&gt; Well, I will certainly post that
paper for the students to read.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.410
As we look at a health care system that
is increasingly using digital records

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.740
instead of paper, the research community
is very excited about the prospect of

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.970
having access to huge amounts of digital
data to study it, to help improve care,

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.380
gain new knowledge, and maybe even
improve the healthcare system itself.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.065
But I don't have to tell you, getting
to that data is often a very difficult,

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:26.420
time-consuming process, mostly because
of concerns about patient privacy.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.170
Some people feel maybe the pendulum
has swung too far on that, and

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.600
we're actually harming our ability
to use digital data as a result.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.690
What's your view?

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.430
&gt;&gt; Well, in fact, I am one of
those people who believe that.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.080
Some of the issues are not necessarily
the HIPAA legislation per se.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.202
But clearly I think HHS has not in fact
creatively tried to manage to this,

00:03:49.202 --> 00:03:53.090
to balance these competitive goods.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.670
Privacy's a good thing.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.540
But too much privacy and
obviously you can't have knowledge,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.560
you can't run a government,
you can't run research and so forth.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.430
And I think that the principle problem
with HIPPA was that it was built in

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.930
an era, and it was all pre-Internet.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.780
So the fact that you could
do data analytics and

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.529
do translational bioinfomatics and
the human genome and proteomics and

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.120
epigenetics with
epidemiologic data as well.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.660
Let alone using it to improve health
care systems with clinical alerts and

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.170
even community health approaches using
public health dimensions to this.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.000
All of that was well before HIPAA.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.860
So, candidly, I've been spending
hours up on the hill with energy and

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.730
commerce staff to try to see if we can,
as part of their initiative

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.590
to improve, really cures is where
they're wanting to go, but care as well.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.750
See how we can hopefully make some
reforms in these things because right

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.130
now it's not only a problem for research
it's also a problem for education too.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.800
I hear issues where pharmacy
students are interested in trying

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.570
to learn how to do data mining and
looking at drug use and so

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.870
forth can't get to the record data at
some schools for some various reasons.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.093
As I say, the issue is not only
the legislation which was built for

00:05:18.093 --> 00:05:19.020
a different era.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.710
Mostly clinical trials where
the patient was at risk, to secure use

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.400
of these data for data analytics where,
honestly, the risks are extremely small.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.710
And I think, actually, if you look
at hospitals around the country

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.930
that are doing research, most patients
actually overwhelmly want doctors to do,

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.380
and other health professionals,
to do this research, and

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.560
in fact actually sort of assumed
that we already were doing it.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.630
So, we really clearly
have some issues here.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.270
And there've been cultural issues where
not all scientists have eagerly wanted

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.050
to share data, but I think the Clinical
Translational Science Awards have really

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.740
cracked into that.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.800
Plus, what has happened in the last
100 years is the human species

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.930
has not only been very productive, but
they've been very reproductive too.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.230
And as a result of that the human
genome's gotten more complicated.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.440
So if we're going to
really crack these things,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.380
which we can,
we really need very big data sets.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.530
And you can't aggregate those, in fact,

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.400
where you talk to a group of patients or
patient advocates with one problem

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.170
because a lot of these
are multidimensional kinds of problems.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.030
In fact most of them are.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.140
They're not single, single chain or
single issue, single dimensional issues.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.750
So anyway, tremendous opportunities, but

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.650
also candidly we are leaving a huge
amount of discovery on the table.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.880
Example, another quick example, HIPPA
says you can use personal health data,

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.919
identifiable data for
doing quality studies in a hospital.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.822
But if you find something that really
you'd like to share with your neighbors

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:06.424
and colleagues and publish it, you
gotta go all the way back to an IRB and

00:07:06.424 --> 00:07:07.380
start all over.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.892
Well, busy people may not
want to mess with that now, and

00:07:10.892 --> 00:07:14.180
some big institutions,
they spend a lot of money and

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.540
extra effort to help facilitate
people being able to deal with that.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.084
But, we can't afford to lose that
wherever it is, smaller institutions or

00:07:23.084 --> 00:07:24.510
larger institutions.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.740
So, we've gotta work smarter.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.760
We can't work harder.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.320
I think the government's not going to
throw more money at health care.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.030
That's, I think, becoming increasingly
relevant for both research as well.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.310
So we've gotta get better data
liquidity, as the term is called, and

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.970
let it move around for
care, for research, and

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.540
then also ultimately then for
population health.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.590
&gt;&gt; Well, you've mentioned
patients a number of times.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.820
And I think most people would agree
that patients are the ultimate

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.380
decider when it comes to
the use of their data.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:03.230
And a number of people have suggested
that patients create their own data

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:09.000
repositories that might be housed in a
PHR or some other tool specifically for

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.600
the purpose of mediating
the sharing of their data.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.020
Do you think this is
an inevitable development?

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.300
Do you think it's a good
development if it happens?

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.040
Might that be the way to increase
the accessibility of clinical data for

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.000
research and other purposes?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.200
&gt;&gt; Well, if it were the only
approach I'd be strongly against

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.510
it mostly because that we
know at least 25% of people

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.799
really don't care if their
data are used for anything.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:36.820
But they don't want to be
bothered to be asked about it.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.634
So anytime you're carving out
25% of the population, and

00:08:40.634 --> 00:08:44.320
keep in mind the population
may be split differently.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.510
For example, a number of years ago
Minnesota passed a law that said you

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.780
had to get people's permission to use
their data, and it turned out Rochester

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.560
was doing a lot of work also in breast
cancer, particularly in younger women.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.210
Well, in Minnesota,
it was very disproportionately

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.645
young women who decided to opt
out of having their data shared.

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:07.470
Well as a result of that

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:11.150
nobody could do research because their
sample sizes weren't big enough.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.870
And obviously I think
that's the challenge.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.470
It sounds kind of good from
a patient autonomy point of view.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.990
But I don't think it's any way to get
discovery in an era where big data

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.539
where you really can try to get to the
core of things and create real cures.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.380
Now, if you're talking
about certain areas,

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.840
I'm not saying that it's
a uniformly bad idea, but

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.770
if you only had one arrow you could
shoot, frankly I think we need to decide

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.990
that as a society, we care enough about
each other that we're going to share

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:47.050
our data to cure things so all of us
can live longer and live better lives.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.420
And also, by the way,
have a cheaper health care system,

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.040
which we clearly need as well.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.130
So, I don't know if that's responsive,
but that's a quick answer.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.720
&gt;&gt; No, that's a great answer.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.950
Well, Don, I think the students have
really gotten some tremendous insights

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.940
here from someone who's been obviously
one of the great thinkers about this for

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.990
many decades now, and I appreciate you
sharing those insights with the students

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.840
and taking the time with us.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.560
Thank you very much.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.490
&gt;&gt; Well you're very gracious.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.540
I enjoy when we can get together and

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.170
obviously hope that it can
happen more often in the future.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:27.420
If a particular student does have
a question that they'd care to

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:32.054
write to me about, I'm not saying how
quickly I'd get back to them, but

00:10:32.054 --> 00:10:35.640
detmer@virginia.edu and
I'd try to respond.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:41.960
And I'll also send a few references to
you that might be potentially useful.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.350
&gt;&gt; All right, well thank you very much.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.500
Have a good day.
