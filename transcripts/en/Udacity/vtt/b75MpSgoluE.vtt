6x plus 3 is equal to 3 times the quantity 2x plus 1. That this sounds actually

00:00:04.693 --> 00:00:09.403
a little bit tricky. One mistake that is really easy to make, is to forget about

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:14.102
this second term inside the parenthesis, the 1. But if we leave it out, then we

00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:18.744
only have one term inside of the parenthesis. 3 times 2x is just equal to 6x,

00:00:18.744 --> 00:00:22.850
and this 3 would have nowhere to come from. Checking to make sure that this

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.946
answer when you simplify it, has the same number of terms as the first answer,

00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:29.047
is a pretty fundamental importance.
