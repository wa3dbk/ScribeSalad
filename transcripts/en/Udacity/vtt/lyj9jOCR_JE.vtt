00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
Since you have so many different tasks to complete in this problem, let's go through them one by one.

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:06.909
First things first the moon position function.

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:10.649
Now we ask to start the moon off at moon initial angle.

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:14.459
So we define moon angle or the angle of the moon at a given time

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:22.759
as moon initial angle plus 2π times the time that has past divided by the total period of the moon.

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.670
So this is basically the fraction of its orbit that the moon has gone through so far.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.759
We then created a 2-dimensional array for the moon's position

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.869
but looks like the horizontal position in this drawing is equal to

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:37.619
the distance between the earth and the moon or moon distance

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:43.719
times the cosine of moon angle and the vertical position is the same except use a sine instead.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.669
So next comes the function of the acceleration of the spacecraft.

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:49.709
Now let's talk about gravity for a second--we know that the gravitational force

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:56.619
that one body feels as a result of another body is dictated by Newton's law of universal gravitation.

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:01.689
We know that our spaceship is going to be pulled towards the earth and also towards the moon.

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:03.409
So we need to take into account how the

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.939
acceleration would be affected by both of these objects.

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.629
Since we're interested in acceleration rather than force,

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:12.648
we can use Newton's second law along this law of gravitation

00:01:12.648 --> 00:01:15.689
to come up with an expression for the total acceleration of the spaceship.

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.659
To figure this out, however, we need information about the relative position of our three objects.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.989
So we started in the acceleration function by declaring a new variable called moon pause,

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:29.728
which is just equal to the moon's position at any given time.

00:01:29.728 --> 00:01:34.978
Now we can define a vector from the moon to the spaceship, this green vector right here,

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:38.639
as just the position vector of the spacecraft minus moon_pos.

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:42.558
Since moon_pos is just the position vector of the moon.

00:01:42.558 --> 00:01:47.729
Then we can define a new variable called acc or at least that's what I'm going to pronounce this word.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.348
Using the equation of the acceleration due to gravity.

00:01:50.348 --> 00:01:53.618
We really owe Isaac Newton a lot of credit in this problem

00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:55.388
consider we're using two of his different laws.

00:01:55.388 --> 00:01:59.709
So you can see modifying his law of gravitation using the second law give us an expression

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.689
for the vector sum of the total acceleration of the spacecraft.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.759
Here everything with a subscript as it stands for spacecraft.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.709
Now our next task was to make the velocity changes happen.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.769
If the first shift in velocity has not happened yet but it's after the time

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.217
at which it was suppose to happen, then we decreased the velocity by 7.04 m/s

00:02:20.217 --> 00:02:22.839
but keep the spaceship moving in the same direction

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:29.709
by dividing our quantity by the norm of the velocity vector and then multiplying it by this vector again.

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.819
We do pretty much the same thing for boost

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.739
but this time we replaced the time with the correct value 212,100 seconds.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.669
In each case since you've changed the velocity in the way it's prescribed,

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:42.789
you can change the proper booleans to true.

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.729
Now finally we get expressions for velocity and position using Heun's method.

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:50.758
Right here we have a simple translation of his equations into Python.

00:02:50.758 --> 00:02:54.789
You can see Euler values with the e's and Heun's values with the h's .

00:02:54.789 --> 00:03:00.748
At the end of this, we set velocity and position equal to velocity h and position h.

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:05.669
So that each time we go through another iteration, they will shift to equal the new Heun's values.

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.539
Now in order to adjust the step size for each position of the spacecraft,

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:13.619
we need to know the difference between Heun's and Euler values for position and velocity.

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.629
You'll remember that we use this to calculate the error.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.659
Then the new step size is set as prescribed here in this line of code.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.729
Since we're up finishing up the step in which h, the current step size is valid,

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:30.668
we add this to the current time and now that the next time step is about to happen,

00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:34.008
we set h equal to h new--updating its value.

00:03:34.008 --> 00:03:37.649
So this explains why we use h in the equations for Heun's method

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:40.648
but are still able to lock the value cycle.

00:03:40.648 --> 00:03:44.639
Since our program is now complete, we can run it using different values for boost.

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.587
We're getting zero as a value to start out with but let's try -10 first

00:03:48.587 --> 00:03:52.129
so we can check out one extreme of the range that we gave you.

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:58.489
But a boost of -10 m/s, we can tell that the ship is pretty far away from touching the earth

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.589
and then when we extend the path out again, it travels past the moon's orbit.

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.619
We can clearly tell that this is not right.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.630
We definitely want to make sure that the crew actually gets back to the earth

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.660
not just circles around again.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.310
Let's try a different value.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.738
Now since 100 is the largest value that we gave you to try, let's see what happens with that.

00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:18.768
Well that certainly looks different from the last plot that we saw.

00:04:18.768 --> 00:04:21.939
Though, this also doesn't look exactly right.

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:26.669
So up close we can tell that it looks like the ship is actually crashing into the earth

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.709
and that's definitely not what we want to happen either.

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:32.139
We wanted to just barely scan the surface.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.599
Zooming out again, you can see that the tail of its trajectory

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.899
doesn't reach out to the radius of the moon's orbit like we said that it would.

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:44.619
So the correct value for boost is in between these two values at 10 m/s.

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:47.619
Here is the solution plot. This looks perfect.

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:50.749
You can see that the spaceship takes off, loops around the moon, comes back

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:55.319
and just cruise the surface of the earth, and then, if we let it go out again,

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.659
it will return to exactly the same radius that it left to initially.

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.539
This is a really complex problem so great job for getting it done.

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.709
The fact that we're done talking about spaceships and orbits, I get excited for Unit 3.

00:05:07.709 --> 09:59:59.000
We're going to talk about how diseases spread to the populations.
