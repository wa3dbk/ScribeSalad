00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.540
Now that you created your repository on GitHub and it has some commits.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.900
Let's take a look at what this looks like on the GitHub website.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.410
Like in the Create Your Own Adventure repository,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.160
I can see what files are in the repository.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.650
Also scrolling back up, I can view the commit history by clicking on commits.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.740
This is similar to running git log on the command line.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.140
But it shows the history of the repository on GitHub,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.040
rather than showing the history of your local repository.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.650
So you'll only see changes that have been pushed to GitHub.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.460
It's also possible to create and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.960
edit plaintext files directly on the GitHub website.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.840
Right now I just pushed from my local repository to GitHub, so

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.950
they have the same content.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.110
But I'm going to add some content directly on GitHub so

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.260
that you can see what happens when you have changes on GitHub that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.090
aren't present on your local repository.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.780
In practice, this can happen if you make the changes directly on GitHub.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.260
But it can also happen if you push changes to GitHub from another computer.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.570
Or if there's another person working on your project who

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.680
pushes changes to GitHub.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.170
To create a new file, I'll click this plus sign.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.090
I'm going to create a file for my lesson 3 reflections.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.460
And I'll the first reflection prompt.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.960
You'll be seeing this prompt pretty soon.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.270
Now, I'll scroll down.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.880
And here I can enter a commit message.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.050
The message to go in the first box, and I can use the second box if I want to

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.920
add a longer description of my commit, but I'll leave that blank.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.750
Now on the right side of the screen I can click Commit new file.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.930
Now I can see that a new commit has been created.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.370
Create file for lesson 3 and add first reflection.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.680
Now I'll demonstrate pulling these changes down to my local repository in

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.350
a minute, but first, I want you to create a new reflections file on GitHub so

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.900
that you can follow along.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.450
You'll see some instructions about how to do that on the next screen.
