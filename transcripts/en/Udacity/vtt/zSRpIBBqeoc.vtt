00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.090
You're given three points of a triangle. Given these three points, two vectors

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.440
are formed. What vector operation do you need to perform to compute the normal?

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.130
Is it the dot product, multiplication, inversion, transposition, subtraction or

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.176
cross product? Don't worry about the normal being normalized, I just want to

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:21.010
know how you get the direction.
