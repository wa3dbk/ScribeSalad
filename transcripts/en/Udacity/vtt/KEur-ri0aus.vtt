00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.932
This decision to make parts of the pipeline programmable is in fact one of the

00:00:02.932 --> 00:00:07.140
challenges of computer chip design. The designers have to decide how many

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.040
transistors are dedicated to memory cache and registers, how many to

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.811
instruction processing, and how many to dedicated algorithm logic. CPUs spend

00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:18.828
their transistors on memory caches and instruction processing. GPUs use to

00:00:18.828 --> 00:00:22.875
spend theirs almost entirely on algorithm logic. Which is also called

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:26.352
fixed-function processing. What's great about the fixed-function logic is that

00:00:26.352 --> 00:00:30.227
it can be extremely fast while using less transistors and less power. The

00:00:30.227 --> 00:00:34.325
drawback of fixed-function logic is that you're locked in. The trend over the

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:37.069
past decade or so has been to add to the GPU more and more instruction

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:42.118
processing, in other words, more general programmability. In our pipeline the

00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:45.432
vertex and fragment shaders are programmable. Only those tests that are

00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:48.036
commonly performed and have large bang for the buck have survived as fixed

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:51.950
function hardware in the pipeline. For example, triangle set up and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.490
rasterization as well as z depth testing are used all the time and do not

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.660
normally need programmability.
