00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.340
Based on the correlation coefficient in this plot, we

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.140
just observed that the relationship between age and friend

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.830
count is not linear. It isn't monotonic, either increasing

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.430
or decreasing. Furthermore, based on the plot, we know

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.610
that we maybe don't want to include the older ages

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.670
in our correlation number. Since older ages are likely

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.820
to be incorrect. Let's re-calculate the same correlation coefficient

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.220
that we had earlier with users who are ostensibly

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.290
age 70 or less. What Cmd would you use to subset our data

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.820
frame so that way we can get a correlation coefficient for just this data?
