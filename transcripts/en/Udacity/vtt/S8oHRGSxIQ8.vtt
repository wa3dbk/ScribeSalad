00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.850
Now there's one more thing I
want to add to our diagram and

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.360
that something to represent
the idea of multiplicity.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.350
In object diagrams,
multiplicity is just a fancy word for

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.430
the number of objects
represented in a relationship.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.930
This is another one of those things
that we're borrowing from UML.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.360
Now multiplicity goes hand in hand
with the contains relationships.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.960
If we look back at the world object,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.020
let's ask yourself some
how many questions.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.570
For example,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.159
how many actors are in the world or
how many backgrounds are in the world?

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.730
We might say, for every world, we have
looks like it could be many actors.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.420
Or for every world,
we might have one background.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.450
And conventionally, we used terms
like one to many or many to many or

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.860
even many to one to
represent this multiplicity.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.860
So right now,
if we think about the actors,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.390
we can see that there's two actors on
the screen but there could be more,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.160
or there could be worlds where
there's no actors at all.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.330
To be honest we don't really know.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.390
So we can do two things here.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.260
Since we already have the app built we
could play around with it some more and

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.240
find out what are all
the different cases for

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.490
the number of actors in the world, or
for what would be the case if we're

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.580
designing this from scratch and
we didn't have the app already.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.430
We could just make a decision and
go with it.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.330
For instance, we could say, for

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.820
any given world there may be one to
many actors, we don't know how many,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.020
there could be a lot, there could be
a little, it doesn't really matter.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.540
We could limit it, we could say for

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.980
any one world there's only
ever going to be two actors.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.210
But I have a little bit of an advantage,
because I already know that there

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.320
could be one to many actors in a world
and if we go back to our diagram,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.060
we can add the multiplicity to this
contains relationship for actors.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.680
And if we read the multiplicity
from left to right it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.580
follows the same order as our arrow.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.940
So for every one world we have,
we can have many actors.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.820
Now let's look at another example.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.680
This one will be for the contains
relationship for the background.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.570
&gt;From what we saw there is only
one background for the world.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.930
So that means this relationship
is one to one, for

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.310
every one world object
there's one background.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.889
The use of the one to many and
the one to one,

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.990
this is another thing that
were taken from you Mel.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.800
So again this is kind of a blend of
both a formal and informal process.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.280
There's something else that
I want to point out and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.140
that is that the relationships
themselves and even the multiplicity can

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.720
go in different directions and
these arrows could be bidirectional.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.670
For example, right now the world
contains one too many actors, but

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.380
you may want an arrow going from
actor to world that says, for

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.300
every one actor it could live
in many different worlds.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.930
If it were the case that in the game,

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.450
an actor might show up in
multiple different worlds.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.690
It's really up to you, you could build
these diagrams however you want but

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.190
these are just some really
popular conventions.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.960
And if you stick close to these
conventions that it makes it easier for

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.440
you to share your diagrams with others.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.700
It also makes it easier to take this
diagram and actually start writing code.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.190
And that's why there are the formal
process is like EML in place because it

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.490
makes it easier to go from something
like EML to code or historically house.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.230
There's one other key takeaway
that I want you to leave with and

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.940
that is that you should use a process
for creating object diagrams that's

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.610
the least restrictive to
you getting your work done.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.100
I mean you could spend an entire day or
weeks designing an object diagram,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.120
but if it doesn't get you any
closer to a functioning app,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.270
then you might just
be wasting your time.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.050
But there's also a great benefit of
having some kind of structure in mind

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.710
before you build it.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.910
As a developer,
you'll discover what works best for you.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.760
Some people like to spend five minutes
on an object diagram others could spend

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.250
an entire week.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.320
And another thing is if
you're working with a team,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.370
a good object diagram
could be a great way for

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.860
the whole team to work together to
understand a really complex system.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.370
All right, I'm going to go ahead and
wrap things up here, but

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.320
if you're interested here's our final
diagram for the alien adventure.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.730
So take some time to look at it and

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.410
maybe you have a better idea
how to organize things.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.010
Anyways, I hope this was helpful and
I encourage you to reach out to us or

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.700
to your peers if you
still have questions.
