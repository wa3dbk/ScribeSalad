00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first one is equivalent.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The reason for that is we have our code here that has "if False."

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
"False" will never be true, so we'll never actually run the "break"Ã¢Â€Â”

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we'll never reach that code.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We'll just run the statement again and we'll have the same thing that we started with.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Every time the test is true, we execute the statement.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The second one is not equivalent, and the reason for that is the "break" will

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
stop the loop.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If the loop would execute more than once in this version,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and if we go through the loop twice,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in this case we can only ever go through the statement once,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
since after we go through the statement once, we reach the "break" and then we're done.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The third one is not equivalent, so here we're having a "while true" that will run

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
forever except for we have the "break" and that would stop it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The problem is the test condition for the break is the same as the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
test condition for the "while," but it should really be the opposite.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In the "while" we keep going as long as the test condition is true.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The way I have written in the code here, if the test condition is true, we stop.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
For this to be equivalent, what we should have written instead

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
would've taken the opposite of the test condition, so if we had "if" not"Ã¢Â€Â”

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which changes true to false and false to true, then the test condition,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
then the breakÃ¢Â€Â”this would be equivalent to the original loop.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What we have is not.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The final one is the most complicated.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This one is actually always equivalent to the original loop.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The reason for that is if we think through the execution, so in the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
original loop, if the test condition is true, we ask to give the statement "S,"

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and then we keep going.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
If the test condition is true the second time, we execute "S" again

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and we keep going.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
If we look at what happens hereÃ¢Â€Â”well, if the test condition is true, we

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
execute "S."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Then if the test condition is true again, we execute S and we keep going.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That has the same behavior.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We should trace it through the case where the test condition is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
not true.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
HereÃ¢Â€Â”if the test condition was true, we execute "S."

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If it's not true the second time, then we're done with the loop

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and we continue.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
In this case if the test condition is true the first time, we'll execute "S."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If it's not true the second time, then we would go to the "else."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So if it's not true, we go to the "else" and then we go to the "break" and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the "break" gets out of the loop.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We have the same exact behavior where we executed "T" once, then

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
we executed "S," and then we executed "T."

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We didn't execute "S" again, and we broke out of the loop to continue.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So these two are equivalent and the other two are different.
