00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.260
You've already seen how convolutional
network uses shared parameters across

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.800
space to extract patterns over an image.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.800
Now you're going to do the same thing
but over time instead of space.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.590
This is the idea behind
recurrent neural networks.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.460
Imagine that you have a sequence
of events, at each point in time

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.840
you want to make a decision about what's
happened so far in this sequence.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.040
Imagine that you have a sequence
of events, at each point in time

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.070
you want to make a decision about
what's happened so far in the sequence.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.540
If your sequence is
reasonably stationary,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.280
you can use the same classifier
at each point in time.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.060
That simplifies things a lot already.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.330
But since this is a sequence, you also
want to take into account the past.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.370
Everything that happened
before that point.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.310
One natural thing to do here is to use
the state of the previous classifier

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.590
as a summary of what happened before,
recursively.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.140
Now, you would need a very deep neural
network to remember far in the past.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.610
Imagine that this sequence could
have hundreds, thousands of steps.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.510
It would basically mean to have
a deep network with hundreds or

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.070
thousands of layers.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.690
But instead,
we're going to use tying again and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.070
have a single model responsible for
summarizing the past and

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.650
providing that information
to your classifier.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.200
What you end up with is a network with a
relatively simple repeating pattern with

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.360
part of your classifier connecting to
the input at each time step and another

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.960
part called the recurrent connection
connecting you to the past at each step.
