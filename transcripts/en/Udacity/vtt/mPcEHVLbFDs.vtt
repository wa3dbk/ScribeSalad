00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.280
What would you say would be
the learning curve of learning Angular?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.970
The learning curve is actually
kind of like jagged for

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.970
Angular because there's
many levels of Angular.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.130
The way I like to think about learning
framework is you learn it as a user so

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.950
you know how to use it very, very well.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.990
But then you learn it as a developer
where you actually know how it works and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.180
you contribute to it.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.040
So on the user side it was
pretty straight forward.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.880
It was kind of steep at first,
and might have had to do with

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.520
my skills in JavaScript and generally,
they were not that good at the time.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.479
But I like to think of it as, actually
the less you know is probably better

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.700
because Angular introduces
a lot of new concepts.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.030
And if you don't have to unlearn
something to learn Angular,

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.360
it's probably a lot easier.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.970
But the learning curve was, I guess
it depends on how you go at it if you

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.710
read books and stuff it's going to
be kind of jagged, you're going to

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.510
read this blog that says do it this way,
and this blog says this way.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.070
But actually, if you just dive right
in and start building stuff with it,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.640
you'll realize that it's actually not
that difficult, it's pretty straight

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.540
forward and you can probably get
an app done in a couple hours.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.010
So just keep building with it.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.890
And the on the developer side,
learning how Angular works internally,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.105
being able to contribute to it,
that just took forever.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:08.820
[LAUGH] I mean I literally had to take
Angular apart, rebuild it from scratch,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.740
and all types of stuff to
really understand how it works.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.650
&gt;&gt; What are some recurring
job script techniques or

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.530
concepts that you found most
useful when learning a framework?

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.750
&gt;&gt; With this day and
age for sure is modules.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.520
Having some type of module
pattern in JavaScript.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.050
Because on the web every line of code
you write is going to be in a global

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.160
scope and that's just not good.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.260
So, frameworks introduce some type of
module pattern to encapsulate your code.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.540
So adopting that pattern whether it's
through the framework or using something

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.080
like ES6 or your own module pattern,
that's definitely a way to go.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.960
I'm totally used to writing
everything in modules.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.510
That's one thing, another thing
is get used to understanding how

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.350
component architecture work because
every framework that's going to come up

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.990
from here out is going to be
using a component architecture.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.950
Which is based off of the web
component standard that's going to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.250
be standard real soon.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.850
So, just wrapping your head
around modules and components

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.730
is just going to leap you bounds towards
mastering all things web development.
