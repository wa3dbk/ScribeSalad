00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.550
The sixth issue you have to deal with in doing object design,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.690
is how you're going to implement control. Recall then,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.600
in your analysis model, you may have some state charts. Those state charts

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.649
describe the allowable behavior of objects of a particular class.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.650
How are you going to implement that behavior? Regardless of how you do it,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.970
recall that the state that you're dealing with, is essentially,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.410
the possible values of the class's attributes. The ad hoc approach merely says,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.300
write the code, okay? Treat it as each particular situation,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.140
that is each state is detected and you take appropriate events.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.320
So you are essentially implementing by hand that, that state chart.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.590
Fortunately, there are more productive ways to spend your time.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.780
There are libraries that already exist that support finite state modeling,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.030
finite state implementations and you can make use of one of those or

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.750
as an intermediate step you could write your own table driven interpreter.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.670
That is the table rows have particular situations that you're in and

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.260
corresponding events or

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.460
inputs that might arise and the table then tells you what to do or

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.660
what to call when that particular, that particular situation obtains
