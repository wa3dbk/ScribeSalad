00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.242
The key to answering this is understanding to be an instance of a class or of

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:08.140
one of its superclasses. The first one is true. Fussy is an instance of a

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.664
Discerning Bear. The second one is also true. It's an instance of bear because

00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:17.140
Discerning Bear is a subclass of Bear, it is not an instance of Black Bear.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.642
There is no path between Discerning Bear and Black Bear. But it is an instance

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:26.484
of object. And that's because Bear is also a subclass of object, even though we

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:31.294
didn't show that, we know that's true because all classes that we defined must

00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:32.903
be subclasses of object.
