00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.315
We would need to add 9, 36, 4, and 25 to complete each of these squares. Great

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:10.358
thinking if you found these numbers. For the first polynomial, we can think

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:14.134
about having one block that's area is x squared, and then six other tiles that

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:19.825
have an area of x. We take the 6x and we split three of the x's over here and

00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:26.097
three of the x's over here. So we'll have x squared plus six x's, and then

00:00:26.097 --> 00:00:31.971
we'll need to add at 9 one pieces to complete our perfect square. So, when

00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:37.830
thinking about completing the square, it's best if this b term is even. This

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.485
allows us to split up the x's, so we have half of them here and half of them

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:44.080
here. And then we can figure out how many one pieces we would need to add to

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.812
complete our perfect square down here. For this first polynomial, it turns out

00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:53.910
that was 9. For the second one, we draw a similar figure as the one before, and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.238
we'll find out that we'll need to add 36 one tiles to complete the square. For

00:00:59.238 --> 00:01:03.898
this third polynomial, we said we had negative 4x here. So, we'll have our x

00:01:03.898 --> 00:01:09.095
squared like before, and then, we'll have negative 4 x's. So negative 2x and

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:14.882
negative 2x, which makes negative 4x. So, if we were to lay out these tiles, we

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:17.550
could see that we would need to add four more one pieces to complete the

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.940
square. We know that this diagram also makes sense in terms of multiplication.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.140
We know x times x equals x squared, and x times negative 1 equals negative x.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.472
We have this negative x four times. Once here, once here, once here, and once

00:01:36.472 --> 00:01:42.554
here. And finally, for these 4 one pieces, we have a sidelength of negative 1

00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:49.597
here and a sidelength of negative 1 here. So, negative 1 times negative 1 would

00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:54.440
equal a positive 1. We have this positive 1 four times, so we know we have to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.410
add 4 one tiles to complete our square.
