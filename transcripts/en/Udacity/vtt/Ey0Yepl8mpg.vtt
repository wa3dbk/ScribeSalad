00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.060
Setting up an AdWords campaign
can be pretty simple.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.400
You start by creating your ad settings,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.670
then writing what your
offer is in the ad.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.420
Next, choose the keywords you want
people to use when they're searching

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.310
for your ad.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.930
Then set your daily budget and bidding.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.329
Just those few steps,
you're ready to go live.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.250
However, before you do this you're
going to need to set up your overall

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.830
account settings.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.041
Now when you're doing this,

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:24.530
be sure to check out
the instructions on how to do it.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.760
Once you set your country and

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.690
your currency,
you're unable to go back and change it.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.400
So after you complete your settings,
you can make your ad campaign.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.965
Your ad campaign is built
out by different ad groups.

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:37.135
Each ad group has its own ad,
keywords, and bids.

00:00:37.135 --> 00:00:41.785
And all these share the same budget,
location targeting, timing, and

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:42.795
settings.

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:45.865
Different campaigns can help you
organize categories of your products or

00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:47.210
your services that you offer.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.895
And when your starting the campaign,

00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:50.910
you're going to need to
customize your settings.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.830
These settings include
things like location,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.140
languages, bidding strategy,
budget, ad extensions.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.950
Things like that.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.830
Google has a ton of documentation
on each one of these settings

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.770
that you could check out.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.160
There's a link in
the instructor note for this.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.450
But don't worry, you can adjust your
bid strategy or budgeting at any time.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.020
Actually, not only can you do this,
you're really encouraged to do it, so

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.990
that way you can optimize your campaign
regularly, based on the performance

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.730
of an ad group or even the individual
ad and the keywords that you have.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.380
So once your keyword's in place, you can
start creating your add group structure.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.550
So from the top level, you're going
to start with your account, which is

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.710
connected to your user name, email
address, password, and billing info.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.380
You can have various
campaigns under one account

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.665
that are going to share
the same general settings.

00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:40.035
And from there you can have ad groups
nested under a simple campaign.

00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:44.265
We're going to title our first campaign
customer acquisition promo offer

00:01:44.265 --> 00:01:48.857
because we're going to offer new members
to a of 15% off coupon and later.

00:01:48.857 --> 00:01:51.897
We can set up different campaigns that
are going to run at the same time to

00:01:51.897 --> 00:01:53.487
achieve different goals.

00:01:53.487 --> 00:01:57.767
So we may want to do brand awareness or
a special campaign for the holidays or

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:02.058
summer vacations based on the
seasonality we noticed in Google Trends.

00:02:02.058 --> 00:02:04.518
The first ad group is
going to be dog owners and

00:02:04.518 --> 00:02:06.788
the second ad group is
going to be dog sitters.

00:02:06.788 --> 00:02:09.157
We've separated these out because
we want different ads and

00:02:09.157 --> 00:02:12.118
different messaging for
our different groups.

00:02:12.118 --> 00:02:13.898
Our dog sitters may want
to hear about the extra

00:02:13.898 --> 00:02:15.779
income they're going to receive.

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:19.889
On the other hand, our dog owners may
want to hear about the luxury we offer,

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.539
or the safe environment we're offering
their dogs, while they're away.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.509
And from there,
we're going to develop our ads and

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.860
different keywords that are specific for
each group.
