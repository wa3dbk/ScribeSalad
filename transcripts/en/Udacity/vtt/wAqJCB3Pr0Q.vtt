00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.410
In this lesson we will learn about VLIW, and explicitly parallel processors,

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.280
such as Intel's Itanium. Unlike their out of order cousins,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.760
these processors do not try to identify ILP on their own,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.100
instead, they just do what the compiler tells them to do.
