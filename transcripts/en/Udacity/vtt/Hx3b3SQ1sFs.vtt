00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.719
So one of the important parts
of code prototypes is that it's

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.550
often useful to build out specific
features rather than the whole app.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.290
Our app has a couple of places where
a code prototype might be useful.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.410
We're looking for something where the
behavior might not be clear to a user

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.160
from our initial prototypes.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.240
Along with places where users
are inputting information into the app.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.610
So, what features of our app
should we prototype in code?
