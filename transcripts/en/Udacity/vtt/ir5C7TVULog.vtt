00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.050
So, at the retina, this local contrast
information is being measured,

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.670
it's being selectively
done on different colors.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.372
And that's going to go out the optic
nerve, and then start getting its way

00:00:10.372 --> 00:00:12.952
into the rest of the brain,
starting with the lateral geniculate.

00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:16.690
And then further processing
takes place up in the cortex.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.110
And both of those will be
the discussion for the next lesson.
