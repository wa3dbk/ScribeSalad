00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer is smaller than 0. There's a negative correlation.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When x goes up, y goes down.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I think if you draw out the data, you get something like this for x and y.

00:00:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And that data perfectly fits in line which makes me believe r = -1 is the perfect correlation down.
