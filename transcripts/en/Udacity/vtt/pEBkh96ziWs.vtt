00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.162
Since solving this equation is starting to take up some space, I'm just going to

00:00:04.174 --> 00:00:08.146
do the rest of our work over here. But know that this is a continuation of the

00:00:08.157 --> 00:00:12.048
work that we've been doing over on the left side of the screen. So, I'll

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.114
re-write what we had before, 5/3x plus 2 equals 4. We can't deal with this 5/3

00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:20.016
yet and we can't get rid of it yet because it's only multiplying x, it's not

00:00:20.028 --> 00:00:24.392
multiplying 2 as well. Before we get to that, we need to get rid of the 2. To do

00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:28.466
that, we subtract 2 from each side, and then all we need to do is handle this

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:32.651
coefficient. As you've done before, you can either divide by the coefficient

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:36.784
itself, so divide by 5/3. But we know that when you divide by a fraction, it's

00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:41.019
the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. So, this is similar to what we talked

00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:45.155
about in the previous quiz, where we said that dividing by negative 3 was

00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:49.915
equivalent to multiplying by negative 1/3. The same thing is true here, division

00:00:49.927 --> 00:00:55.545
by 5/3 is equivalent to multiplication by 3/5. Either way, we'll get rid of the

00:00:55.557 --> 00:01:01.180
5/3 in front of the x. And then 2 times 3/5 is just 6/5. And that's our final

00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:02.975
answer. x equals 6/5.

00:01:02.982 --> 00:01:07.038
Like with all of these problems, we can take 6/5 and substitute it back into the

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.923
original equation we had, to check and make sure that both sides of the equation

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:14.833
are actually equal to each other when we apply this condition of x equals 6 over

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:14.912
5.
