00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.692
Here are the like terms, and these two aren't like, because they have 2ab

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.891
squared and 3a squared b. The exponents don't match. After regrouping our like

00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:15.132
terms together, we add them to get our result. And, remember, these terms aren't

00:00:15.132 --> 00:00:18.157
like, so we just bring them down into our cell.
