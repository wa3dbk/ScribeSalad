00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.394
We figured out this equation in the last lesson and in the previous quiz by

00:00:04.406 --> 00:00:08.838
finding a pattern in this data right here that relates n to d. But in order to

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.371
find patterns as easily as possible, we need to see the connection between data

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:17.967
like we have in the table, mathematical descriptions like our equation right

00:00:17.979 --> 00:00:22.555
here, and to add to our list, visual representations, or graphs. For the

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:27.511
situation we're dealing with, a graph might look something like this, but how do

00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:32.177
we make this? Well, we start by plotting points. Each row of data in our chart

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.621
right here is a pair of numbers, one for d and one for n, and we plot those

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:41.433
pairs of numbers on our graph. For the first point I would graph, I have the

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:46.443
numbers one and 23. So if we're on our coordinate plane here, on the d-axis

00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:51.833
which is the horizontal one right here. I'd start at zero and move over one, and

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:56.893
then, move up 23 on the n-axis, which is the vertical one. I could do the same

00:00:56.905 --> 00:01:02.207
thing for 2, 46. I count over from zero in the positive direction, two slots,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.952
one, two, and then up, 46.
