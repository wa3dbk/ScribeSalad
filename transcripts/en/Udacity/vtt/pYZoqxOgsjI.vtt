00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:03.220
So we going to use this structural to higher our

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.350
pattern, to combine two data sets and these data sets

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.310
are going to come from forms and what we're

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.670
going to want to do, is understand what the reputation

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.350
or the karma of the author of a post is and to do this we're going to have to

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.360
combine two tables. A post table and a user

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.540
table. Sorry. And a post contains data about each post.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.670
Some ID, the title of the post, any

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.300
tags this author ID, which is going to be interesting

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.040
and then the body of the post, and some

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.780
other things. The user table. This is the user

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.100
pointer ID. And that is the common key

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.290
we're going to use to combine these two data sets.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.860
It also has some other information like reputation, which

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.630
is going to help us answer this question and

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.380
gold, silver and bronze badges. So, go ahead

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.570
and see if you can answer this question.
