00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.750
Here's the correct answer. Excellent work if you got it. When we start to

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.154
factor, we want to look for a greatest common factor first. The three terms

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:12.575
don't share an x, so I can't factor an x out. The three terms also don't share

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:16.615
y, since this first term doesn't have one. And when we look at the coefficients,

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:20.975
the greatest common factor is just one. This trinomial is a perfect square

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:27.155
trinomial pattern. The a is to x and the b is 5y. So we can factor our trinomial

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:31.716
using a minus b squared. 2x minus 5y squared.
