00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What I have to do is I have to check all my cases where I have recursion

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and eliminate any possibility for infinite recursion.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now, there are two possibilities in the star function and the plus function.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Those are the two cases where regular expressions have recursion.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But now star I defined in terms of plus,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so all that's left is to fix plus to not have an infinite recursion.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Here's how I define plus.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Basically, I said that x+ is defined as x followed by x*,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and the x* is in turn defined in terms of x+.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The problem was that I was going through and saying, okay,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for x when I'm doing plus(opt(a)), for my x I want to choose opt(a).

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Okay, I think I'll choose the empty string.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So I chose that, and now I'm left in a recursion

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
where I have an x*, which is defined in terms of x+,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and I haven't made any progress.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I have a recursive call that's defined in terms of itself.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We know in order to make sure that a recursion terminates,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we have to have some induction where we're reducing something.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It makes sense here that what we're going to reduce is our set Ns.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
One way to guarantee to do that is to say

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
when I'm generating the x followed by the x*

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
let's make sure that the x generates at least 1 character.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If we can guarantee that x generates a character,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
then when we go to do the x* we've reduced our input.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So we have this inductive property saying that now our set of Ns will be smaller.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It's smaller by 1 each time, and if it started out finite and we reduce by 1 every time,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
then eventually we're going to terminate.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Let's see how we can implement that idea of saying

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
every time we have an x+ we have a x and an x*,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
we have to choose at least 1 character for x.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Note that that's not limiting us in any way.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
That hasn't stopped us from generating all possible expressions,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
because if we were going to generate something,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
it would have to come from somewhere--either from this x or this x--

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and we might as well make sure it comes from here

00:02:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
rather than adding an infinite number of nothings before we generate something.
