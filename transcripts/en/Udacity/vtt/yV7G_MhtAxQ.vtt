00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.469
Here is a slightly different nested loops question. How would you write nested

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.350
loops that print out this pattern of square brackets, without the slashes at

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.345
the front? So you would print one pair of square brackets on the first row, two

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:14.728
on the second row, three on the third row and so on. There are a lot of ways to

00:00:14.728 --> 00:00:19.980
do this that work, it's a little different from the last problem. In the clock

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.980
problem the number of columns was the same for each row, but here it varies.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.930
When you fill in the code for this, make sure to use this variable for the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.790
number of rows. This way we'll be able to change it, and this will work for any

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.343
number of rows.
