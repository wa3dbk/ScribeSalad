00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:02.480
The rules of the programming model are just as simple.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.310
They are based on something called composability. Let me tell you a little bit about that.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.147
If you recall how CUDA works, kernels launched into a given stream are interdependent.

00:00:11.147 --> 00:00:15.051
That means that in this case, for example, B cannot run before A has finished,

00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:17.153
and C cannot run before B has finished.

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:20.808
It's how CUDA streams work, which I think you probably learned about in a previous lecture.

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:27.898
So if B creates its own work X, Y, Z, we call this child work to B

00:00:27.898 --> 00:00:36.245
where B is the parent of X, Y and Z. Now composability says that whatever B does is entirely private to B.

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:41.681
That means C has no idea and quite honestly doesn't care what B is doing.

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:47.757
B is not considered to have finished until all of its other children, X, Y, and Z in this case, have also finished,

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:51.254
so A, B and C still execute in sequence as expected,

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:58.230
and B follows the rules of composability such that whatever B does has no effect on Cs ability to execute.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.441
So, in effect, B actually looks like a single kernel, even though internally it is doing all of these other steps.

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:09.524
So it does not just stop here. Note you can have child kernels start their own children,

00:01:09.524 --> 00:01:11.840
P, Q and R in this case for example,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.143
so you have got grandchildren of B, you can go on to generations of great, great, great grandchildren if you like,

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:21.816
until you run out of memory, the point being that it all composes and stacks back

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:24.985
into looking like it's a single part of B, and that's composability.
