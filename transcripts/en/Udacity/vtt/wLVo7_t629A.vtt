00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.960
In is vowel, we want to return true if letters.substring equals a or e or i or

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.869
o, so we add those comparisons using or. So, it would look like this. I had to

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.419
type letters dot substring a whole bunch of times maybe I should have made that

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:24.018
a variable. And then, every word I used letters.substring i to i plus 1, I

00:00:24.018 --> 00:00:29.733
could replace them with letter. That looks a lot better now for is consonant a

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:35.151
letter is a consonant if its not a vowel. So, I can take a shortcut here and

00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:40.712
just return not is vowel for the given index. I don't need to tell it that it's

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:45.934
an int. And I didn't actually initialize letter. If I want to test my method, I

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:51.390
can make a new word. I'll fill it with sleep. And now, if I ask if the first

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.545
letter is a vowel, I get that it's not because it's an s. If I ask if it's a

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:59.325
consonant, I get true. I would probably want to test a couple more cases if I

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:05.703
was going to ship this code to somebody. But, this looks like it's working for

00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:07.114
now.
