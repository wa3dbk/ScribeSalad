00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.430
As you have seen in this lesson,
the distribution of daily returns for

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.830
stocks and the market look
very similar to a Gaussian.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.520
This property persists when we
look at weekly, monthly, and

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.610
annual returns as well.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.410
If they were really Gaussian we'd say
the returns were normally distributed.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.300
In many cases in financial
research we assume the returns

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.010
are normally distributed.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.860
But this can be dangerous
because it ignores kurtosis or

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.870
the probability in the tails.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.940
In the early 2000s investment banks
built bonds based on mortgages.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.070
They assumed that
the distribution of returns for

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.910
these mortgages was
normally distributed.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.500
On that basis they were able
to show that these bonds had

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.070
a very low probability of default.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.110
But they made two mistakes.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.760
First, they assumed that the return of
each of these mortgages was independent,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.310
and two that this return would
be normally distributed.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.680
Both of these assumptions
proved to be wrong,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.310
as massive numbers of homeowners
defaulted on their mortgages.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.419
It was these defaults that precipitated
the great recession of 2008.
