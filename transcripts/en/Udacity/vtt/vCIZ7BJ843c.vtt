Let's say that the circles are laid out. So that the fields touch the sides of

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.087
the fields that they're right next to. And fields are nestled an equal distance

00:00:07.087 --> 00:00:11.175
from the field just above them on the left and the right. This calculation

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:14.680
takes a few steps, so we'll need to go through an example by hand first.
