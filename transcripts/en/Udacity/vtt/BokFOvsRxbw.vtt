00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.494
Psychologists make a distinction between three different types of affective

00:00:03.494 --> 00:00:07.922
experiences. We should first state that the word affect, is in an umbrella term

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:11.208
used to cover all emotional experiences, including emotions, moods, and

00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:16.785
affective states. Let's start with emotions. Emotions are brief, sudden changes

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:20.738
in our conscious experience and body that are responses to personally

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:27.097
meaningful situations. We feel emotion about very specific situations. Such as

00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:31.507
when we fail an exam, get an A on an exam, break up with our significant other,

00:00:31.507 --> 00:00:37.025
or have something stolen from us. Emotions are very short lived, typically

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:42.427
lasting no more than 30 seconds to 1 minute. At most. They focus our attention

00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:46.030
and guide our memory, perception, and decision making. Think about how you

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.280
learn if you're really angry or depressed, or the kind of buying decisions you

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.196
make when you're really happy, compared to when you're really sad. The actual

00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:58.356
experience of anger, disgust, happiness, or fear, for example, usually last

00:00:58.356 --> 00:01:03.223
only a short period of time. They can lead to other emotions, though. For

00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:07.240
example, sometimes we get angry at ourselves for feel jealous or embarrassed.
