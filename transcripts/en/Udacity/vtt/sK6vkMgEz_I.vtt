00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome once again to another chance to practice your programming skills.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Today we're going to take a look at a problem that's important for physical devices

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
like yearbooks in a school or phone books or really any sorted index.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The problem we're going to cover this time is how to organize

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and search through sorted information.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The approach I want to take is to use a tree.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We've seen trees before in some computer science programming.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The particular kind of tree I'm going to focus on

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is one that has 2 branches at every level.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Suppose I have a number of friends that I want to keep track of in my yearbook

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
or in a telephone book.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I could use a Python list to include all 4 of their names or all 4 of those elements.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I can check to see if an element is in a list in Python just by using the keyword "in"--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
putting the element on the left and the list on the right.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But we might wonder, "What is Python doing behind the scenes?"

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
"How is this implemented in practice?"

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
One way to do it--and the way we'll explore today--

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
is to build up a special kind of tree holding all of the information that I want to see.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm going to start with the first element of my list

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and make it the root or the top of the tree.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Let me sketch out the rest so the tree is easier to see.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I've added the elements from my list--1, 2, 3 and 4--to this tree,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and I've put them in a special order corresponding to how they'd fall

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in English alphabetical order.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So since the J in Jacob comes before the M in Margaret,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I've made Jacob the left child in Margaret.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Since the N in Nelson comes after the M in Margaret--j, k, l, m, n, o, p;

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
yes, I can remember the English alphabet--I've made it the right child.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And the A in Alice follows all the way down here to the left.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I'm going to construct a special tree to store information like this

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that has a number of properties.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The first 2 just summarize or formalize this ordering intuition we had above.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Everything to the left of Margaret and all the way down

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
is less than or equal to--comes before in the alphabet,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is a smaller number than if I'm storing phone numbers instead--

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the information stored at Margaret's node.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Jacob and Alice both come before Margaret in the alphabet, so they're both on the left.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And similarly, right subtrees contain only information that's greater than or equal to--

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
larger, later in the alphabet.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Nelson comes after Margaret, so it's here on the right.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And then finally--and this is really important--

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
both the left and the right subtrees also follow rules I, II, and III.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It is turtles all the way down.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That makes this tree something special in computer science:

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
a recursive data structure.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We've already seen recursive functions that are defined in terms of themselves.

00:02:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Now I'm talking about a recursive way to lay out data that's defined in terms of itself.
