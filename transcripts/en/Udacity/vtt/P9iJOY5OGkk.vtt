00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It turns out that the answer that we're looking for is 3.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Ob is one and tuse is another, and it's really tempting

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to put obtuse together because they're separated by a comment.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You think "Boy, if I just remove that comment, they'd be one word, obtuse."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But remember, you really want to treat comments as if you were totally erasing them

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so it leaves a gap.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The lexer is entering the HTML comment. Mode, it's coming back.

00:00:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Ob and tuse are really quite separate, and then we've got tangle as the third at the end.
