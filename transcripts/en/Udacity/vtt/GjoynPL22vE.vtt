00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.012
Writing a story isn't easy.

00:00:02.012 --> 00:00:04.660
Building one about your business
that captivate your audience and

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.550
teaches them the value you
provide is even harder.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.280
Now you have just a few minutes
to pitch your idea, and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.820
it's possible to lose our attention
in the first ten seconds.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.220
So what do you do?

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.320
In this lesson, we'll figure that out.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.420
We'll take all the work
you've done thus far and

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.310
organize it into a compelling story.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.590
You'll learn how to present the story,
overcome any objections, and

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.250
refine your pitch over time.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.038
By the end of this lesson, you'll have
a pitch you can use to help secure

00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:30.284
investment, build your team,
and grow your business.

00:00:30.284 --> 00:00:31.457
So welcome to the lesson.

00:00:31.457 --> 00:00:34.370
You've got an amazing story to tell,
so let's get started writing it.
