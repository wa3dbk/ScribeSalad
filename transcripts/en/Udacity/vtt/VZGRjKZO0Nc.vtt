00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.756
Well we know that a circle is flattened on a screen, so it must be

00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:08.223
2-dimensional. The same is true for a triangle, a square and a trapezoid.

00:00:08.223 --> 00:00:12.610
They're all flat, so they must be 2-dimensional. A cube and a cylinder are

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.040
definitely 3-dimensional. We can hold a cube in our hand or we can pick up a

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.464
cylinder, like a cup or a glass. Great work on that quiz.
