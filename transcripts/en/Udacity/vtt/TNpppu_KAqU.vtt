00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.870
Let us first consider a simpler sentence. So

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.530
consider the sentence Ashok made pancakes for David with a griddle.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.420
I'm sure you understood the meaning of this sentence almost immediately. But

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.626
what did you understand? What is the meaning of meaning? We can do several

00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:19.100
different kinds of analysis on this sentence. We can do lexical analysis,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.710
which will categorize each of these words into different lexical categories. For

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.390
example, Ashok is a noun, made is a verb, pancakes is a noun, and so on. We can

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.840
do syntactic analysis. In terms of the structure of this particular sentence.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.998
So, you might say Ashok is a non phrase. Made pancakes for David with a griddle

00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:41.480
is a verb phrase. And this particular verb phrase itself has sub phrases in it.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.690
Or we can do semantic analysis on this, and say that Ashok was the agent.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.550
Made was the action. Pancakes were the object that got made. David was

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.002
the beneficiary. Griddle was the instrument. The knowledge base here as

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:58.400
oppose to understanding stories like this. Semantic analysis is at a forefront.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.060
Syntactic analysis and lexicon analysis will serve semantic analysis. So

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.980
here are some of the semantic categories in terms of which we can classify

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.260
the different words in the sentence. So Ashok is an agent, made is an action or

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.420
verb in the lexical sense, pancakes are the thematic objects,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.630
the things that are getting made and so on. The frame for representing

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.480
understanding of this sentence has the verb of the action make, the agent Ashok,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.260
and so on just like we just discussed. This then is the meaning of meaning. This

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.370
is what the agent understands when it understands the meaning of this sentence.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.830
This is perhaps also what you understand when you understand the meaning of

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.940
this sentence. How do we know that you understood the meaning of this sentence?

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.670
Well, we know that because I can ask you some questions and you can draw

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.200
the right kind of inferences from it. So for example, given this sentence,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.720
I can ask you, well who ate the pancakes? And you might be able to say,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.140
well David ate the pancakes because Ashok made the pancakes for David.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.100
Notice that this information about who ate the pancakes was not present in this

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.530
particular sentence. This is an inference you're drawing. This is a very similar

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.240
to what we had encountered earlier when we had sentence like Ashok ate a frog.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.380
At that time too, we'd ask questions like, well, was Ashok happy at the end?

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.050
And the frame had some default values which said Ashok was probably happy.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.240
Or, was the frog dead at the end, and the frame for

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.290
eating had some default value which said that the frog was dead at the end?

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.160
So according to this theory, the meaning lies in the inferences we can draw from

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.410
it. You understand the meaning of this if you can draw the right inferences. You

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.530
do not understand the meaning of this if you cannot draw the right inferences or

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.180
if you can draw only the wrong inferences. This frame representation of

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.920
the meaning of this particular sentence allows you to draw the right inferences.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.470
Given the action make here, the thematic role pertains to the relationship of

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.360
various words in the sentence. To this particular action of making.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.796
Ashok is the agent, David is the beneficiary, and so

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:03.360
on. So far we are describing meaning of this sentence, and how we

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.850
can capture that meaning in this frame. We have not yet described the process by

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.390
which this knowledge is extracted out of that sentence. The extraction of

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.780
the meaning of this sentence is exactly the topic that we will discuss next.
