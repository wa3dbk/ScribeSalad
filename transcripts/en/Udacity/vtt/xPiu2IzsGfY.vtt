00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.938
Well, that was nesting. The other, important addition to state machines that

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:11.760
Harel offers is concurrency. In this case, concurrency is indicated by a dashed

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.120
line. It separates a larger roundtangle into two other machines,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.480
but in this case, it is nesting that goes on at the same time. That is,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.890
we've cranked up two machines that are running.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.550
Each can have their current state, each can respond to transitions and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.290
each can perform actions depending upon the transitions. 'Kay, once again,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.560
this reduces the total number of states from a multiplicative combination to

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.060
an additive combination. Here's from Harel's paper on the left,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.570
is the bowl of spaghetti, that indicates the multiplicative combination.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.910
Notice the labels of the states are really indicating where you

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.720
would be in one of the concurrent machines, and where you would be in

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.692
the other concurrent machines hard to understand what is really going on there.

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:04.620
Harel has replaced this

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:12.260
jumble by one major state labeled y and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.066
left two of the original states, H and I to interact with it.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:24.440
The y-state has that dash line indicating concurrent

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.100
actions that are taking place, they correspond to states a and d.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.520
They each have default states, they each have their own transitions. But,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.790
hopefully, you can see it's a little bit easier to follow what's going on there.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.710
Notice also that Harel allows the splitting of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.430
a transition to go to two possible states, one in each of the concurrent arms.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.750
So the lower right state in the rightmost diagram, I has an E transition coming

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.090
out of it that's then split into two places. There's also an example of a data

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.038
condition in here as well. In UML the concurrency looks like the following.

00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:12.230
There are two states here, there's an idol state and a maintenance state.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.700
The maintenance state has the dashed line in this case it's a horizontal line.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.880
And two concurrently executing machines, one called testing and one called

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.870
commanding, each of which are quite quite simple. Each has an initial state and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.720
and a final state and some transitions between them.
