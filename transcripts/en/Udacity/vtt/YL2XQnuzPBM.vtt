Heartbeat is the autonomic nervous system because that's what controls our

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:08.980
involuntary systems, such as heartbeat or breathing. Feeling a soft blanket is

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.431
our somatic nervous system because it has to do with sensory input. The same

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:18.396
goes for smelling paint that's also one of the senses. And digesting food is

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:22.649
back to autonomic nervous system because that's another involuntary action.
