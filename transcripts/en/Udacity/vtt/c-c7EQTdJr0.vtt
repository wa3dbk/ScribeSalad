00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.520
Something I've been leaving off in all of the console commands I've

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.120
been running is an ending semicolon.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.400
The inclusion or exclusion of a semicolon at the end of every line of

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.650
JavaScript has caused some disagreements in the JavaScript community.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.990
In the language specification, it requires you, if you're trying to

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.950
be perfectly correct, to end every statement with a semicolon.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.600
What's happened since JavaScript's come out, though,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.720
is that people often forget semicolons, and the JavaScript interpreter, or

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.830
the browser, tries to make a best guess effort as what you meant.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.470
You can get by without using semicolons, but it's best to be explicit.
