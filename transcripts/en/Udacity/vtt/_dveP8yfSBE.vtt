00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.250
If you chose this graph you're correct. As scores increase on the x-axis, they

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.290
decrease on the y-axis. This scattered plot would indicate no relationship.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.320
Here we would have a positive relationship. As scores increase on x they also

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.840
increase on y. Note, the .4. It's not as we had a perfect correlation. Instead,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.260
we have a moderate relationship.
