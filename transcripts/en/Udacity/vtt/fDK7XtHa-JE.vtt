00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.991
You would have to walk 41 miles in total. That's pretty far. First, you'd start

00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:10.244
at mile marker 210 where your car broke down. You'd walk 20 miles west, and

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:16.178
then 21 miles south. So we would just add 20 miles and 21 miles, which is 41

00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:23.300
miles. Hopefully you also figured out that this is not the shortest distance.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.311
The shortest distance between any two points is actually a straight line. Now

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:31.131
we're going to assume that the region in this area is relatively at the same

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:36.130
elevation. Meaning we're not going uphill and downhill a lot in any direction

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.490
we go. This is why we can be fairly sure that this distance would be the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.400
shortest distance from mile marker 210 straight to the town.
