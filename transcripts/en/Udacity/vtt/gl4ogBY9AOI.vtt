00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.906
Correct answer is $10. Recall that the formula for the standard error of the

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:07.520
mean is the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of n. So

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.364
here's how we calculate that. 50 divided by the square root of 25 is 50 over 5.

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:17.333
50 divided by 5 is 10. This $10 tells us that we expect sample means, to differ

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:23.175
from the true population mean by $10, on average. So, remembering the sampling

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:26.892
distribution of the mean, the mean of that distribution is equal to the

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:32.238
population mean mu, which is 151. We expect most sample means to fall one state

00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:37.810
of deviation above and one state of deviation below. So we expect most sample

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.072
means to differ from mu by $10 on average. So most sample means should fall

00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:45.094
between 141 and 161.
