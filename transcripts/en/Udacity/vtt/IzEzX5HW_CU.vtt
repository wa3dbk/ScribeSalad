00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.980
The last UML structural diagram I want to discuss

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.750
is the deployment diagram. The deployment diagram provides a static

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.220
deployment view of a system, and unlike previous diagram,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.980
it is about the physical allocation of components to computational

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.950
units. Think, for example, of a client-server system in

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.130
which you'll have to define which components will go on

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.880
the server and which component will go on the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.200
client. For deployment diagram, the nodes correspond to computation unit;

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.090
for example, a specific device. And the edges indicate communication

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.880
between these units. Also in this case, I'm going to illustrate deployment

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.720
diagrams using an example for our course management system. And

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.820
also in this case, I'm going to use a slightly more complex

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.910
diagram than usual. But I don't want you to look

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.170
at all the individual details. Instead, I would like to focus

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.530
on a few main aspects. So, if you look at

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.700
this diagram, there are three things that you should clearly see.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.555
First, you should see how the system involves four

00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:56.590
nodes, a web server, an application server, a DB

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.740
server, and a mainframe. Second, you should see which

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.500
components are deployed on which nodes. For example, the student

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.400
component is deployed on the application server. And finally,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.570
you should see how the nodes communicate with one

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.880
another. For example, you can see that the application

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.030
server and the university database communicate using a JDBC protocol.
