00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.310
When you look around these days,

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.985
it's easy to forget the mobile
revolution is really a few years old.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.330
Smartphones were becoming popular
in the US by 2003, 2004 and

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.610
even earlier in Japan.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.379
But, it wasn't really until 2007 when
Apple released the iPhone that mobile

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.633
apps became a thing.

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:21.100
Now, it's hard to imaging
life without them.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.170
They fundamentally changed how we
communicate with each other and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.730
how we interact with everything

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.290
from banks to newspapers to taxis
to your neighborhood pizza boy.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560
And, they've created a whole
new way to play games.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.610
Over the last decade, mobile gaming
has grown into a huge market.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.080
Developers have embraced it and

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.110
mobile game popularity has exploded
along with the new platforms.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.430
At first, writing games for phones or
a tablet was much harder than for PCs or

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.300
gaming consoles.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.800
The hardware was there but gaming
libraries and tools hadn't caught up.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.980
Today, all the pieces are there.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.610
Powerful hardware with stunning
graphics and audio capabilities.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.120
Tools and frameworks to enable fast and
easy game development.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.420
Widely accepted monetization options to
support many different business models.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.790
And most importantly,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.030
a world-wide base of customers who love
to play games on their mobile devices.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.380
It's an amazing time to
learn game development.
