00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.940
With a Bayesian detection rate and
base rate fallacy in mind,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.520
let's discuss the system
architecture of network IDS.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.360
First, typically the volume of packet
data in the network can be huge.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.550
Which means the base rate at
the packet level is typically low.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.770
For example, there can be tens of
millions of packets per day in

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.390
a network, but only a few involved
the intrusion activities.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.020
Therefore, according to
the base rate fallacy,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.350
if we apply detection
algorithms at the packet level,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.060
this may result in very low
Bayesian detection rate.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.880
Instead, we should apply
detection models to data

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.060
that has higher base rate.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.920
This can be accomplished using
hierarchical architecture.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.630
First, we can apply filters
to the packet data.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.520
For example,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.430
by inserting libpcap to capture
only packets to certain services.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.890
Second, the event engine analyses
the filtered packet data, and

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.300
summarizes them into security related
events such as failed log in's.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.700
Finally, detection models are applied
to the security related event data.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.370
As we can see, the volume of data is
decreased first by a packet filter and

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.660
then the event engine.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.140
Therefore, as long as we can keep
the intrusion evidence in the event data

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.510
the base rate is going to be a lot
higher than the original packet data.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.120
As a result the IDS model
applied to the event data

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.561
will yield a higher
Bayesian detection rate.
