00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So welcome to Unit 6.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In Unit 6 we're going to look at ways to use cryptography

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to solve a wide range of problems.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In Unit 5 we focused all on using cryptography

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to solve the traditional problem of authentication

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and then communication with secrecy and integrity.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What we're going to look at in Unit 6 is

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
different kinds of problems we can solve using cryptography.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The first thing we'll look at is Anonymous Communication,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and we'll learn about how to use a chain of asymmetric encryption

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to enable two parties to communicate over a network

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
without anyone knowing that they're even talking with each other.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Then we'll look at how to do voting,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and there are lots of issues with voting--we won't get into all of them--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but we'll look at the issue of can you provide an accurate tally--

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
know that each vote is counted without revealing who voted for whom.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This will also be done using a chain of asymmetric encryptions

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but with some added features to ensure that the vote tally is correct.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Then we'll look at ways to provide digital cash--

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
a way to represent and transfer value similar to paper cash

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that can be done all with cryptography.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This will involve introducing some new techniques.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We'll look at a centralized way of doing that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which can be done using a new technique called blind signatures.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And we'll also look at a decentralized way of doing that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that doesn't require any trusted authority

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but uses proofs of work to create value.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And this is what the bitcoin network does.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is just a small sampling

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
of the kinds of things that you can do using cryptography.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
All of these can be used just using the tools we've seen in this class.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And we'll see ways to use asymmetric cryptography

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
in many different ways in these examples.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We'll also see ways to use symmetric cryptography,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
including hash functions,

00:01:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
as well as one-time pads.
