00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.672
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What I'd like you to tell me now is what the coordinates of these two points

00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:07.785
of intersection are. Now I know that this probably seems a little bit tricky to

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:11.809
do on the graph, but we can do it algebraically. So thinking about what these

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.777
parabolas are actually graphs of, which equations they're graphs of, try to

00:00:15.777 --> 00:00:18.364
solve for the x and y coordinates of these points.
