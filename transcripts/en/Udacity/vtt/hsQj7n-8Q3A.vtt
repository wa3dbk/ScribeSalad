00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.280
Now we will see how loop unrolling works. Suppose we have this loop

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.140
in the C language, where i goes from 1,000 down to zero. And in each

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.830
iteration of the loop, we add something to the ith element of the array a.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.210
When we translate this into instructions, we get a loop like the one we

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.360
have already seen. We load from the array elements so

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.100
R1 is now the pointer to the ith element of the array. We load that. We add R3,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.230
that would be Rs to that and then we store it back into the A of i. And

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.100
then we move our pointer four places down. That's equivalent to decrementing i.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.190
And then we check whether the pointer has reached the beginning of the array,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.730
which is equivalent to checking whether i is zero. Now let's

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.560
apply loop unrolling to this loop. We will do what we call unrolling once.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.810
We unroll the loop by making each iteration of the new loop do more than one

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.790
iteration of the old loop. So, when we unroll once, what we want to do is now

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.010
each iteration of the new loop will be doing the work that it should be doing,

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.250
plus the work of the next iteration. However, if we just do it this way,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.590
then we are doing the same work twice. So, instead, what we will do is we will

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.180
adjust the index so that this is doing the ith element of the array. And then,

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.630
i would be decremented. And the next iteration would now do a of i minus 1.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.120
However, this loop still counts one at a time.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.810
So we do this, we add s to the next element in the next iteration of the loop.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.100
We would now add s again to the same element we already processed here.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.040
So we also need to adjust the loop counter update to update by 2 now.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.280
And now we have a new loop that has half as many iterations,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.280
each of which is doing the work of the two original iterations.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.900
We could unroll the loop more than once. For example, unrolling two times would

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.370
mean that this loop is doing now three times the work of the original iteration.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.700
For this once unrolled loop, the instructions would look like this.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.590
We would have the actual work of the one iteration.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.520
These are the same instructions as here. We now want to do this work once more.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.000
This would be this. However, if we just copy the instructions again,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.590
we would be doing the same work twice. We would just add R3 again to our

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.410
same element a of i. So, instead, we will adjust the offset here so

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.770
that we are accessing the element right below the one that R1 is pointing to.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.060
This would be the a of i minus 1. And now we need our loop counter update and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.750
the actual loop back branch. But those we cannot simply copy,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.650
just like here we had to update the counter to count by two iterations.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.790
In this code, we were decrementing R1 to move to the element below.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.440
Now we're processing two elements at a time, so we need to move 8 bytes at

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.210
a time. So the approach to unrolling once is take the original work, copy twice,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.580
adjust the second copy so that it does the second iteration's worth of work, and

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.520
then adjust the loop count so that it's moving by two iterations,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.660
not by one. This is what it means to unroll once. So

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.530
keep in mind that when we are doing two iterations at a time,

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.260
we have unrolled the loop once because we have added one iteration

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.790
of the original loop in addition to what the iteration normally would be doing.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.200
Unrolling twice would mean that we're doing three iterations at the time.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.410
Unrolling three times means that were going four times the work and so

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.300
on. It is a very common mistake that when you're asked to unroll the loop twice,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.500
unroll it this way. This is unrolling only once. Again, unrolling twice is not,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.060
do two iterations at a time. It's do one plus two iterations at a time.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.519
Because you always have to do one iteration, so this loop is not unrolled once,

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.080
it is not unrolled at all. This is unrolled once.
