00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.300
R would equal a plus s divided by s minus a fantastic algebra skills for giving

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.502
that one correct. If you stumble a bit then let's see how we do this, there was a

00:00:10.502 --> 00:00:15.731
factoring part to this so that might have been tricky first we multiply both

00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:20.711
sides by the LCD r, r minus 1 we distribute the s to get sr minus s is equal to

00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:25.999
ar plus a we also have to distribute the a here Now, I'm at this point. And this

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.488
is where I need to think back for what I'm solving for. I'm solving for r. So

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:34.961
let's get these r terms on 1 side of our equation. And these other variable

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:40.801
terms here. So we'll have sr minus ar minus s equals a. We get this from

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:45.188
subtracting ar from both sides of our equation. If we add s to both sides. We'll

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:50.304
have the r terms on one side of the equation. And now we want to factor. We take

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:55.281
r out from each of these terms, and then divide each side of this equation by s

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:59.250
minus a. This gives us our final answer. And remember that these two equations

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.233
are actually the same. A plus s in the numerator is the same as s plus a.
