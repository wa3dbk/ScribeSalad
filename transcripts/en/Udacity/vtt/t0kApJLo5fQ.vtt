00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.886
As I mentioned before, we actually solved this equation for the values of u.

00:00:05.886 --> 00:00:10.781
But we're really interested in the values of x. We want the values that make

00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:15.610
our original equation true, not this middle one containing the variables of u.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.636
So since we've performed this step of a u substitution here, we want to turn

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:25.750
these u values back into x values. I'll start by listing my answers, u equals 9

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.206
and u equals 4. Now, we can substitute this value of u with x squared. This

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:36.856
allows us to get the x values that make the original equation true. We simply

00:00:36.856 --> 00:00:41.060
just sub each of these for x. Now that we've made the substitution for u, what

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.730
do you think the values of x could be? When you think you have the answers,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.132
write it as a solution set here. Use commas in between each response. Good

00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:51.392
luck.
