00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.660
As you may have guessed, the right choice is, the most clicked results in a CPU

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.070
interrupt. That's the first thing that happens, and

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.258
once the interrupt has been delivered to the CPU,

00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:16.490
there are domino effects that may eventually result

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.360
in some program running to read the spacial coordinates.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.390
But the thing that happens when you click

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.670
the mouse is it results in a CPU interrupt.
