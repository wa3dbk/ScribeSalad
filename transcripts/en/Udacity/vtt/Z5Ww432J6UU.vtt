00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.100
Another important consequence of having several machines share the same

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.660
medium is that two messages can't be sent at the same

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.850
time, if they tried the data on the line would likely

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.070
be corrected. We say that there is a collision when this

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.470
happens. These collisions can have an important role in the performance

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.280
of distributed systems where multiple machines, connected by a local network,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.140
are used to solve a problem. So understanding how and why

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.860
these collisions occur is important for the study of operating systems.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.660
We'll discuss three solutions to the collision problem. The

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.450
first is Carrier Sets Multiple Access with Collision Detection,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.550
or CSMA/CD, which was used with early ethernet. When

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.460
a node sends a frame, it also measures the

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.840
signal on the wire. If it finds what it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.520
sent, then great. If not, then it assumes another

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.410
node was trying to send at the same time,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.230
causing a collision. Therefore, it sends a special jamming signal

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.130
that helps ensure that all other nodes detect the collision.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.890
It then waits for an amount of time that is part

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.460
exponentially based on the number of recent collisions it has detected

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.160
but also random so that the nodes don't all just mirror

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.560
each other and keep sending messages at the same time. Another

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.280
solution to the collision problem is token ring or token bus.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.090
Here, the nodes in the network are arranged in a ring,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.430
either through physical connections or

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.240
logically. They then continually pass around

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.040
a token that is empty by default that determines whose

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.000
turn it is. If this node here wants to send a

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.810
message, he waits for the token, then sends out his message,

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.990
and once he's received an acknowledgement, he then continues to pass

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.670
the token on around. The next one wanting to send a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.470
message will grab the token, send out his message, wait for

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.590
an acknowledgement, and then pass the token around some more. This

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.880
system is fair, and it does not fail under heavy loads,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.810
but it suffers from more latency than the more

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.860
aggressive CSMA/CD. Where possible, both traditional ethernet and token ring

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.380
have been largely replaced by switched ethernet. A switch is

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.020
physically connected to the nodes like the hub, but instead

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.630
of broadcasting every frame that comes in like the hub

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.020
it looks at the destination MAC address and routs the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.310
frames accordingly. The advantage is now that we have fewer

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.730
collisions. For instance, two pairs of nodes can communicate simultaneously

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.770
whereas this would have been impossible before. Naturally, a switch

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.940
will need a table mapping MAC addresses to the physical

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.070
port it should send the frame out to. One convenient

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.080
way to populate this table is with learning. Whenever a switch

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.590
sees a frame, it examines the MAC source and puts

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.430
that MAC address along with the port number in the table.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.440
Then to figure out where to send it, it looks

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.000
in the table and if it finds the appropriate port, great.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If not, then it just broadcasts the ethernet frame to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.690
all the nodes. Once we run out of ports, we

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.330
can begin to arrange switches in a hierarchy like so.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.650
In our top level switch, MAC addresses for this subtree

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.760
will all map to port one. Those in this subtree

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.630
will map to port two. And those in this subtree

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.060
will map to port three. Lower down in this switch,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.880
the MAC addresses for these machines will map to their ports.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.320
And the MAC address for all these other machines in

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.240
the network would map to this switch's uplink, since that's the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.230
path along which the frame would need to travel. Switches dramatically

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.470
increase the number of messages that can be sent over a

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.870
local network. In the simplest topology where all nodes are

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.620
connected to a single switch, it's almost as good as having

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.140
a dedicated link between each pair. The only way that server

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.050
one wouldn't be able to send to server 1 is because

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.850
server 2 itself is busy, never because the link is busy, and even when

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.510
server 2 is busy the switch can cue up frames to be delivered later.
