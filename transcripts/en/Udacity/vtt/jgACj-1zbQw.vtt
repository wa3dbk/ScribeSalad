Taking a little breather here just
to remind you what we're doing.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.920
So we have this, for

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.830
basically, we're doing window-based
object detection, right?

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.000
The training, we basically get it,
see it says obtain training data.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.440
Doesn't say how.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.890
You just hopefully can go to the web,
or like I said,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.410
you pay somebody to click on things,
because you can do that these days.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.250
You define some features, so

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.460
you have to figure out what it is
you're going to measure about it.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.430
And then you're going to
train a classifier, and

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.740
that's what's shown here.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.400
So I take my windows that can, and
I I, I have positives and negatives,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.080
that comes from this great big set of
training examples you see over here on

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.840
the left, I've got these cars, then over
on the right, you've got these non-cars.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.560
So it is, you use those training
examples, you extract the features, and

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.090
then you train your car
versus non-car classifier.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.680
At testing time,
what you do is, you again,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.570
you're going to take your new image, and
you're going to take this window and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.060
you're going to slide it all over.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.290
Until, hopefully, you end up, you land
over here and you classify it as a car.
