00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Suppose you're taking a Udacity class.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And I guess you're taking one right now, so let's drop the suppose.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Among the students that take the class with you, you find the following age distribution.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
From 13 to 19 there are 12,000 students.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
From 20 to 32 there are 96,000 students.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And from 33 on there are 36,000 students.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I now want to construct the pie chart with you. Here's my pie.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I want you to place the separator for the very first class

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of the age 13 to 19, which is the blue class.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Please check the box on the perimeter of the pie chart

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that best places the separator.

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For example if you check the box over here,
