00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.730
Following on from that,
we have our functions for

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.220
on connection suspended and
on connection failed.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.030
For now, in these, I'm just going to
log that the event has happened.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.860
And you can see this here,
log.I, log tag.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.970
Google API connection's
has been suspended.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.570
And similar here,
Google API connection has failed.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.830
Now we're almost done.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.350
And we are almost ready to get
location updates from our phone.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.700
Now there is one more thing
that needs to be implemented,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.660
and that's the on location
changed call back.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.420
Now I've created a simple skeleton for
it here.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.580
Here you can see what I am doing is the
on location call back gets a location,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.360
that I call location
with a lower case l.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.361
And I'm just going to log
the location.toString and

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:41.290
I'm going to set tax
location.tostring on that as well.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.840
So we can see the full location details.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.210
So let's run this code and
see what actually happens.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.398
Here we can see what has happened
after I've run the code, and

00:00:49.398 --> 00:00:51.020
it's not the friendliest in the world,
does it?

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.480
But we can see that
it's basically working.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.780
We can see our latitude,
and our longitude, and

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.910
acceleration and
altitude and even bearing.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.350
So all this is just because we
converted the location to string.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.990
But let's pull out,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.460
say for example the latitude, and get
the latitude information and put it in.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.560
And you can actually see
that it updated there and

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.310
it just updated again, because of slight
movements and me moving the phone.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.660
So let's update this and
see what happens.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.620
Now if you'll recall, I just had set
the txt output to be location.tostring.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.780
But let's make this something
a little bit more interesting.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.250
For example, let's pull out the latitude
from this and we'll work with that.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.610
And the easiest way to do this will
be I'll just paste the code in.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.520
And we can see here that what we're
going to do is we're going to set

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.920
the text to be location.getLatitude.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.980
Now this returns a double, so
of course we have to pass that

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.730
to Double.toString in order to
convert that double to a string.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.440
So now,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.110
just the latitude from the location
object will be written to the text view.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.310
So let's run that and take a look.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.190
So now here, we can see the same
application is running.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.880
But I've just gotten the latitude
of my current location, and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.690
I've written it into the text label.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.100
That's a lot friendlier.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.170
And we could use that for example to
have a tax label for latitude, another

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.890
one for longitude, another one for
altitude, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.180
So very straight forward and

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.650
congratulations you've just gotten
your first location updates.
