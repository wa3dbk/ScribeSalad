00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.780
Ready for your next challenge?

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.280
Now this one may seem much harder, but

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.160
it's not actually as bad as it might seem at first.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.690
Right now if you click on one of these, nothing happens.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.550
But if you double click on it, it'll actually put you into edit mode.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.620
I can type again, and press enter.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.926
And sure enough, it just changed the to do application item.

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:21.869
But that's not very intuitive, so

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.730
let's add an edit button that shows up next to the delete button.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.020
You'll notice when you hover over one of these.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.770
You also get a delete button that pops up.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.760
If i type some nonsense in here, when I press enter sure enough I can

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.888
roll over and press the x button and it will go away forever.

00:00:37.888 --> 00:00:42.610
Now we want to add an edit button just like this x button here.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.030
Just right next to it instead, so there will be an x button and an edit button.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.100
Now I did a little bit of work for you.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.730
You won't have to write any CSS for this one.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.260
If you make a button with a class of edit-btn,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.250
it'll get all the proper style to appear in just the same way as the x button.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.220
Now you're job is to figure out where to put the button code.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.570
The actual button, physical button.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.310
And how to wire up that button, so when you click on it, it edits the note.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.850
Remember first, be a detective, then be tofu,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.700
when you actually make the changes.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.290
Best of luck.
