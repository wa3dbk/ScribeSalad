00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.263
We can also have functions where the n points are not included. For example, in

00:00:04.263 --> 00:00:08.539
this graph you can see that there's circles at either end point. Open circles

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.829
other than closed circles, showing that neither of the end points are included

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:16.946
in our domain. So in this case how would you write the domain using interval

00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:17.536
notation?
