00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.300
The range of x for this first inequality goes from negative infinity to positive

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.616
infinity. Remember, of course, that we need the round parentheses, not including

00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:12.783
the infinities. The second goes from negative 2 including negative 2 up to

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:17.387
infinity. The third starting at negative 2, including it, up to 6, not including

00:00:17.387 --> 00:00:23.283
it. And the last one starting at negative 6 but not including it and up through

00:00:23.283 --> 00:00:24.164
infinity.
