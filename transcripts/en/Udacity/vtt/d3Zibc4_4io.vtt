00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.270
Let's try to summarize what we've done so far.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.010
We started with the initial question,

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.460
how popular were the different brands of candy?

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.400
We then thought about,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.760
what sort of quantities should we use to make this question quantitative.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.380
Interselection time, total number of selections.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.970
And we ended up going with interselection time.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.520
With a way to quantify the problem in hand,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.950
we then had to cast the question as a rigorous statistical inference problem,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.640
such as confidence sets or classification.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.870
We ended up going with point estimation.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.299
Specifically, we chose to create a regression estimator in which,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.430
given the candy and the particular choice number,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.750
what is the interselection time of that candy?

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.520
Specifically, how long has it been since someone chose that particular candy.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.840
Previously, we took a look at some plots of interselection time for

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.270
individual candies.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.840
Let's examine multiple plots on the same graph at once.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.670
Here is depicted the interselection times of Rolo and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.530
Reese's, with Reese's in blue and Rolo in green.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.400
As you can see, the average interselection time of Reese's starts out lower, but

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.930
jumps a bit at the end.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.450
And vice-versa for Rolo.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.170
Recall that lower interselection time corresponds to higher demand.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.260
And conversely, higher interselection time corresponds to lower demand.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.730
Thus Reese's starts out in high demand, but

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.900
then gradually gets selected less and less often.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.510
Conversely, Rolo starts out in low demand, and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.840
gradually becomes selected more often.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.090
This plot lends some support to the notion that, in fact,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.880
there is some interaction between different brands of candy in the candy bowl.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.380
If true, this should not be very surprising.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.710
The brands of candy do not sit in the candy bowl in isolation.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.570
A person's choice of a particular candy is influenced by the presence of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.880
other candies in the bowl.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.970
If, in fact, people preferred one brand of candy overall to another,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.060
then you'd expect the time between selections for

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.960
one brand to be low at the same time the other was high.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.110
As the first one starts to be depleted, the interselection time for

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.790
the second type starts to go down.
