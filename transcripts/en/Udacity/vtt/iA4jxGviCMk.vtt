00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm not sure what assertions you added, but let's look at some of the ones that I decided to add.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
One condition we can do is if self.tail is greater than self.head,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
then the difference between them has to be the size.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That is to say, the distance between the head and tail has to be the number of elements 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
currently in the queue.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
On the other hand, if the tail is less than the head,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
then that means that the tail has already wrapped around,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and in this case the difference between head and tail 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
has to be equal to max minus the size of the queue.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The third case that we have here is that if the head and tail are at the same place,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
then either the queue is empty or the queue is full.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Let's go ahead and run this on the bugging and see what happens.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So, we violated an assertion, 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and better yet, we violated an assertion in the checkRep function. So, that's good.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What this means is by violating an assertion in a checkRep function,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we caught the bug, we're terminating the program, and we can debug the code,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
using sort of localized debugging inside this data structure.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We don't have to do some huge tracking down of where the bad values came from.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, we want to do one final check here to make sure that my assertions are right.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I want to go to my buggy key code, fix it, and run the code again.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What we want is all of these assertions should succeed during the test cases.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Okay, good. So, that was the case.
