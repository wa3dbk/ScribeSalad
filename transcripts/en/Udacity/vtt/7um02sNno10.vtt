00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.212
Let's summarize what we've been talking about for the past few quizzes. We

00:00:03.212 --> 00:00:09.800
started with a function, f of x equals x minus 5 times x plus 3. We figured

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.168
out, it's two factors are these two quantities inside parentheses. That told us

00:00:13.168 --> 00:00:16.696
that the x coordinates of the x intercepts are 5 and negative 3, and these two

00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:21.946
numbers are the same as the zero's, or the roots of the function. Let's see if

00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:26.779
we can fill out all this information for a new function. This time we have f of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.536
x equals x minus 2 times x plus 7 times x minus 1. Please tell me what the

00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:36.992
factors of this function are, what the x coordinates of it's x intercepts are

00:00:36.992 --> 00:00:42.121
and what the 0s are. Notice I've already written an x equals here for you. So,

00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:45.598
in the zero box, I'd like you to just write, the values that x needs to equal

00:00:45.598 --> 00:00:50.626
in order for the function to equal zero. In each of these three boxes, please

00:00:50.626 --> 00:00:52.749
separate your answers by commas.
