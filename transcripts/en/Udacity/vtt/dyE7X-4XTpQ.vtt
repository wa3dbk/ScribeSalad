00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Fortunately, this graph is small enough

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that we can enumerate through all the possible Eulerian paths.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Starting at Javier, we can go through Christian to Sayo,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
over to Marcie to Tyrone to Hubert, back to Javier, Marcie--for one.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We can co Javier to Christian to Sayo to Marcie back to Javier

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to Hubert to Tyrone finishing at Marcie for our second one.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can go Javier to Hubert to Tyrone to Marcie to Javier to Christian

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to Sayo to Marcie for our third one.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There's a fourth path through, and there's a fifth path.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Finally, there's a sixth path.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That is all the Eulerian paths through the graph starting with Javier.
