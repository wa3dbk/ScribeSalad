00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:05.240
My answers would be, there are 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 positive positives.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.800
8 over here.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.710
Number of positives, actual positives that I misclassified as negative are 3, so

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.760
the guys over here.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.340
And only one truly negative is misclassified as positive.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.860
So that's the confusion matrix.
