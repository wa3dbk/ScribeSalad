Now going back to the 3 pricing schemes for the 3 different cleaning solution

00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:08.336
companies, we want to figure out how much each of these solutions would cost

00:00:08.348 --> 00:00:12.630
Grant's cleaning glasses company if he were to buy them. You're going to want an

00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:16.899
equation for each solution option so that he can compare how much he would spend

00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:20.814
depending on how many gallons of solution he wants to buy. Let's start by

00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:24.890
creating a general word equation that we can use later to create specific

00:00:24.902 --> 00:00:29.510
equations for each of these brands. Here are some quantities. Gallons of

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:34.530
solution ordered, price per gallon, shipping time, total cost, rush order fee,

00:00:34.637 --> 00:00:39.550
and distance shipped. I'd like you to place the letter corresponding to one of

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:44.325
these quantities in each of these boxes. To create an equation that you think

00:00:44.337 --> 00:00:44.702
fits a situation Grant is up against.
