00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.080
To do this, we need to add a method to our book class. We're going to want to

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.860
use the substring method to print out just the text from the beginning to the

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.207
first period. So, the first index we should put in is zero because that's the

00:00:14.207 --> 00:00:17.074
first index of the character in the book, and then we need to find the end of

00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:22.870
the first sentence. We can do this using the indexOf method that we used before

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.019
to look for Mad hatter. And now the key here is that substring for the second

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.635
argument, wants to take the character after the last character to print. So, if

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:37.340
the last character we want to print is the period and that's our endOfSentence,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.310
we want to give substring endOfSentence plus one. Now in our tester, we'll

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.650
want to add another line where we test out our new method and compare it to the

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.272
expected value, which is a little long. So, we'll need to split it across a few

00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:58.776
different lines. And see how this worked. So, the actual is exactly what we

00:00:58.776 --> 00:01:03.128
expected and the expected is missing some line breaks and goes to the side for

00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:09.090
a long time. But other than that, it looks like this is basically doing what we

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.850
wanted.
