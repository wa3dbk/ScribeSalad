00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.014
No, just like you learn in lesson one where if you have a population and you

00:00:05.014 --> 00:00:10.262
take a sample, the sample statistic won't be exactly equal to the population

00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:15.810
parameter, most likely. There's a range of values for the mean that any samples

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.778
could have. So same with this, if we had some kind of intervention on the

00:00:20.778 --> 00:00:25.386
population, so in this case, the Bieber tweeter, and everyone started using

00:00:25.386 --> 00:00:30.876
that. Then our best guess is that the mean would be about 40, but it could be

00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:37.176
anything around 40. So in other words, there's a range around 40. That the true

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:43.482
population mean would be, if everyone were to use the Bieber Tweeter. Now how

00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:48.237
big is this interval? We're going to decide actual numbers that should be

00:00:48.237 --> 00:00:53.750
bounding this interval. In order to do that let's think back about this sampling

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.893
distribution.
