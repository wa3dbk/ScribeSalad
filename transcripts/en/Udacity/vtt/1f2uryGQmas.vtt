00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.269
Okay, let's see how you answered. These two questions were actually a technique

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:10.051
that's called the door-in-the-face technique. Here, a person will ask for a

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:14.339
larger request that is most likely a bit over the top, and then when the result

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.886
is no, they ask for a smaller request. Here's an example I experienced

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:24.168
personally. When I was in graduate school and on a limited budget, I received a

00:00:24.168 --> 00:00:27.588
phone call from a firefighter's association looking to raise money for

00:00:27.588 --> 00:00:32.800
firefighters and their families. I was a big supporter of the firefighters.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.418
However, the person asked if I could donate $100. And I actually did not have

00:00:37.418 --> 00:00:42.507
$100 available to donate. And I told them sorry, that that was too much. And

00:00:42.507 --> 00:00:48.302
immediately the person said, oh well, can you perhaps give $15? And right away

00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:51.882
I said sure, I can give $15. And the idea here again is that this was a

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:56.850
technique called the door-in-the-face, and it's actually quite effective.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.205
Asking for something that is large and maybe not typical, a person's likely to

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:06.290
say no. When you followup with a more reasonable request, a person is typically

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.860
more likely to respond positively. Can you think of any personal experiences

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.016
with these two techniques that we discussed? Perhaps you can share them on the

00:01:15.016 --> 00:01:15.669
forum.
