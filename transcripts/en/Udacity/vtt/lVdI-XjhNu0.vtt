00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.182
The sample size in each group is 3. And we'll multiply this by the group mean

00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:11.060
in Food A, minus the grand means squared. Plus the group mean for Food B, minus

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:17.629
the grand mean squared. Plus the group mean for Food C. Minus the grand mean

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:26.954
squared. This gives us 3 times 9 plus 0 plus 9, which is 54.
