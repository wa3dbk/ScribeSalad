00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.370
So all three people that Lauren just mentioned are considered by society to be

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.710
very intelligent people. The truth is, we don't really know their intelligence.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.254
They never took IQ tests. In fact, there's reason to believe that Darwin for

00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:16.906
example, was only average in his IQ. But these people still accomplished great

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:21.550
things. So what's going on here is that psychologists, when they use the word

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.574
intelligent. They mean something much more specific than the way people use the

00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:29.980
term in every day life. So what did all three of these people have in common?

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.128
They were all very creative. They were able to generate new ideas in new fields

00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:39.109
of study. So psychologists make a distinction between creativity and

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.985
intelligence. So we do this because they're really different things. So the

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:48.608
research on the relationship between intelligence and creativity has shown that

00:00:48.608 --> 00:00:54.379
the correlation is only about 0.20 between them. Meaning that knowing someone's

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.200
IQ only tell us a very little bit about their level of creativity. So for

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.680
instance, someone could be really high on intelligence and not all that

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.610
creative. Likewise, someone could be really creative and not score all that

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.676
high on IQ. Although they probably would be at least average or maybe slightly

00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:13.820
above average on intelligence.
