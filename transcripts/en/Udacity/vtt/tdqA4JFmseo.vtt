00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.980
Now that we've implemented some d3 code and put what we learned about visual and

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.090
coding into practice I just wanted to recap where we are quickly.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.040
In addition to being readily acceptable to a large audience,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.030
d3 has a very nice API, or application programming interface.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.530
This allows the library to function in a declarative manner.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.480
Or rather, you tell d3 what you want,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.390
not how you want it to accomplish the task.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.473
By decoupling the specification of an operation from the execution of

00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:35.757
that operation, d3 allows the user, you.

00:00:35.757 --> 00:00:39.220
To focus on the specific application you're developing.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.170
While still enabling engineers to possibly optimize the processing of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.750
those operations.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.220
Another interesting side effect of this is that the back end or

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.588
the graphics engine that d3 renders to could possibly be swapped out.

00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:58.630
I mentioned d3 renders the SVG and HTML.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.170
But you could imagine it rendering directly to HTML5 canvas or

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.980
even webGL for increased performance.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.700
What do I mean by a declarative API exactly?

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.956
Well, for example, you do not need to tell the browser to draw a circle

00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:23.758
at pixel 50 by 100, and then another circle at pixel 100 by 175.

00:01:23.758 --> 00:01:27.590
And finally a line that connects these two circles.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.740
For every data point you may have in let's say a JavaScript array repeat this

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.010
process and continue drawing circles and lines between them.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.410
This process would be very tedious and possibly error-prone if for

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.610
every datum you have, you have to tell it exactly where to draw the circle.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.060
And then, exactly how to draw the lines connecting them.
