00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.766
For this exponential equation, the value for x equals 3. Great thinking if you

00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:11.949
found this number. We'll take 125 and write it with a base of 5. So we'll have

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:16.610
5 cubed on the right hand side and 5 to the x on the left hand side. Since

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.672
these two bases are identical, we can set the exponents equal to one another.

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:24.070
So x must equal 3.
