00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:05.309
Interestingly enough, in this case the range is also just values that are

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:10.180
greater than 0. Since the endpoint that we are starting from is this open circle

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.789
at the origin. And that all of the points lie to the right and above this point.

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.350
No value of a of x is ever going to drop below the x axis. We also have to know

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.620
about the overall shape of the entire function, a of x, without the domain

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.793
restriction. So if you're looking at this in an idealist environment. Maybe it

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:31.947
would help us out to look at this entire function without the domain restriction

00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:34.243
or the range restriction for just a second.
