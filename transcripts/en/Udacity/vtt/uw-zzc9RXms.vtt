00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.473
So now that we have a working asset manager it's probably worth taking a step

00:00:03.473 --> 00:00:08.200
back and talking about how good asset loading works in good games. See, proper

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.158
asset loading means you need to take into account how a user's going to

00:00:11.158 --> 00:00:15.843
experience your game and benefit from that properly. So for instance, if you

00:00:15.843 --> 00:00:18.710
were on a CDROM drive you have to know that it's going to take a certain amount

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.294
of time to actually stream data from the disc into memory. So, you have to

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:27.200
pretty much cover that by doing some 3 second animation or something else to

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.503
hide from the user, that's streaming overhead. Now, some very interesting

00:00:32.503 --> 00:00:36.168
examples of this come to mind. The first is probably one of the more famous

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:40.384
ones, Devil May Cry, back on the original PlayStation 2. This game had a really

00:00:40.384 --> 00:00:42.778
cool mode, that while the scene was actually loading, if you did your button

00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:46.476
smashing, you'd actually do damage to the loading bar. I actually remember

00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:49.644
sitting in my room watching my roommate kind of smash on this button controller

00:00:49.644 --> 00:00:54.670
as mad as possible, because he was so angry that it was taking so long to load.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.212
But by the time the level actually loaded, he was happy again and could go on

00:00:57.212 --> 00:01:01.637
killing all sorts of demons. The second example that comes to mind is actually

00:01:01.637 --> 00:01:05.370
Metroid Prime for the Game Cube. This was actually a simplistic tunnel shooter,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.295
effectively you had segments of geometry that your player would move through

00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:13.241
over time. They did something really cool, is that they only allowed one

00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:17.530
section of tunnel in memory at a time. This meant that each tunnel could be

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.260
super high resolution graphics because there was nothing else competing for

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.766
space. As you moved towards the end of the tunnel, though, towards one of those

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.454
little doors you've got to shoot to open, it would start streaming in the next

00:01:26.454 --> 00:01:30.344
level. The problem with this though was if you started running too fast, you

00:01:30.344 --> 00:01:34.094
would get to the door before the streaming was done. You'd sit there shooting

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:37.630
the door and it wouldn't open yet because the next level hadn't loaded. My

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.060
personal favorite is actually Jak and Daxter. These guys had probably one of

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.036
the earliest streaming mechanisms that I ever found. And the coolest way to

00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:49.953
hide it too. They had an infinite terrain. So you could run around and do all

00:01:49.953 --> 00:01:53.545
sorts of stuff. But if you for some reason were able to move fast enough that

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:56.900
you were moving in an area that the terrain hadn't been streamed off a disk

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.405
yet, they'd trip your player. This is the only time in the entire game where

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:05.060
your player would actually fall down, and then play a 3 to 4 second get up

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.139
animation. Of course during that time they had plenty of extra space to spit up

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.924
the rest of the data from the disk. The point is this, most of game development

00:02:13.924 --> 00:02:17.060
is smoke and mirrors, so take advantage of that to give your user a believable

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.800
experience.
