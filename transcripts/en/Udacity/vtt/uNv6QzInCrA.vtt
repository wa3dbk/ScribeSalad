00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.320
Algorithms in the message passing model,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.310
always assume some topology for
the network.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.020
But suppose you design an algorithm for
one kind of network, and

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.050
then run it on another one.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.780
How well will it do?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.390
This lesson considers network topology,
which will give you some techniques for

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.290
thinking about this question.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.950
Now in the early days of parallel and
distributed computing,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.760
network topology was a big deal.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.240
Then, through better engineering of
networks and through virtualization,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.100
it seemed like it didn't matter so
much anymore.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.689
That led to cost models,
like the alpha beta or

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.990
the latency bandwidth model,
where you could just sweep away a lot of

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.990
the details of network
communication under the hood.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.010
But communication layers
are getting faster all the time.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.680
And the scale at which we
operate systems today,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.560
is getting bigger and bigger.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.730
Thus my personal opinion is that once
you have a billion or more processor

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.850
systems, the network topology is
going to start to matter again a lot.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.250
And so we shouldn't forget
its basic principles.
