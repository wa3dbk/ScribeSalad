00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.700
Now I want to show all of you a classic example of a pinhole photograph.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.560
Here is one and

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.050
you notice that very interesting things are happening in this one.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.650
All lines are straight.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.570
There is no form of distortion.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.320
Also if you look at it, the whole image is, has infinite depth.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.290
That has everything is in focus.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.060
This is a pinhole where there is no lens whatsoever.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.540
Basically somebody built a box, put a small hole in it,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.500
and put a film or a censor on the other end and generated this image.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.430
Actually it looks pretty nice.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.962
And basically what's important is there is no form of blurring,

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:46.060
no de-focus artifacts, and each and

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.140
every line if you were to draw it, would appear completely straight.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.180
Of course when we start going over from pinhole cameras,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.820
we'll notice that we will be compromising on these types of

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.450
perfect capabilities that a pinhole camera might have.
