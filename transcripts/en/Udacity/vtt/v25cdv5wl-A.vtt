00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.430
Today, we'll talk about production systems. I think you're going to enjoy this,

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.120
because part of production systems is going to do with learning.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.550
And this is the first time in the course we'll be talking about learning.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.240
Production systems are kind of cognitive architecture,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.695
in which knowledge is represented in the form of rules. This is the last topic

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:25.380
under the fundamental topics part of the course. We'll start by talking about

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.740
cognitive architectures in general, then focus on production systems,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.460
then come to learning, a particular mechanism of learning called chunking.
