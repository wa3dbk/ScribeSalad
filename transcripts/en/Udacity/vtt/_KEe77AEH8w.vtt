00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.080
Because TLB's kind of like a cache.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.710
Let's talk about how it is organized
in terms of cache properties.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.620
First, easy direct map of fully
associative or somewhere in between.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.200
Well, it is small, so
it is already very fast.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.430
So it tends to be fully or
highly associative.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.670
Usually we don't have direct map TLBs

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.520
because that would sacrifice the hit
rate for speed, but because it's so

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.810
small, it's already very fast so
we don't really need that.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.770
How about the TLB size?

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.720
We want it to hit at least
as often as our cache, so

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.660
we want it to cover more
memory than the cache.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.660
So we usually want our TLB to be
somewhere about 64 to 512 entries.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.110
What if we need more TLB entries in
order to get the hit rate that we want?

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.600
Well, you don't want it to be too large
because then it's going to become slow.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.540
In that case,
you want to have a two-level TLB.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.220
The first level, or level one TLB,
will be the small and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.730
fast one that hits in a single cycle.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.380
But if you have a miss there,
we have a larger level two TLB.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.580
It has a hit time that
is several cycles, so

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.040
it's significantly slower than L1.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.330
But still way faster than going through
memory and doing the translation.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.300
And it is large.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.340
It can be several thousand entries
because with several thousand entries we

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.890
can still support relatively good hit
times, but not a single cycle time.
