00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.356
In lesson 11, you learned how to test for a significant difference in means

00:00:03.356 --> 00:00:08.426
between two independent samples. But in many research studies, we want to

00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:13.756
compare means from more than two independent samples. If we have three samples,

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:19.732
we would need to do three T tests, A and B, B and C, and A and C. But what if

00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:24.580
we have four samples. How many t-tests would you need to compare all of them to

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.889
each other?
