00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.412
For the solution, I added a line of thresholding code, using a turnary if

00:00:04.412 --> 00:00:08.039
statement. One problem you might notice with this algorithm is that the

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.500
highlights are actually too sharp now. If you look closely at the result, it's

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.910
quite aliased since values are either on or off. This sharpness is also true

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.190
for our tune shader. But it's even more obvious here because the contrast

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.280
between light and dark is so great. There are ways of modifying the function so

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.900
that it is smoother at a transition point. Though because it's view dependent,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.384
it's hard to get this exactly right. Alternately, anti-aliasing schemes such as

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:36.490
FXAA, can clean up problems like this. I leave it to you to experiment.
