Hey, Dan, we finished the settings. 
Do you want to check it out?

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.640
Oh, great.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.110
Wait, what's with all 
this stuff right here?

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.420
I'm glad you asked. 
All this stuff will help me demonstrate

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.260
the power of implicit intents,
leveraging other apps

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.630
to get functionality 
for your app for free.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.040
For example, why would you 
write a bar code scanning app

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.149
when you can just launch 
an intent to do it for you.

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:23.358
(crunching glass)

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:25.858
Or a camera app, 
when you can just launch

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:27.343
an intent to fire a photo.

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:28.953
(glass shatters)

00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:31.203
And of course, it would make no sense

00:00:31.203 --> 00:00:33.314
to write a phone app just to dial 
a phone number.

00:00:33.314 --> 00:00:35.949
- You would just call the intent.
- Wait, I need that.

00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:40.840
In other words, don't reinvent the wheel.
Lazy programmers make fewer mistakes.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.610
Now, let's go implement 
an implicit intent.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.500
Raydo? 
Dan's being implicit again.
