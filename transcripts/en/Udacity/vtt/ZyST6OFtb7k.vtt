00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.370
So how do we represent a class in a class

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.140
diagram? Class is represented as a rectangle with three parts. The

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.290
first part is the class name. Classes should be named using

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.160
the vocabulary of the domain, so we should pick names that

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.059
make sense. And the normal naming standard requires that the classes

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.720
are singular nouns starting with a capital letter. The second part

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.840
of the class are the attributes of the class, where the

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.310
set of attribute for the class, we find the state for

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.940
the class. And, we can list an attribute simply by

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.060
name, or we can provide the additional information. For example,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.520
we might define the title of the attribute, and we

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.450
might also define the initial. Value for the attribute. Finally, the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.850
third part of the class consist of the operations of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.050
the class. And normally, the operations of the class are represented

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.090
by name, with a list of arguments. That the operation

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.340
will take as input, and with a result type. So the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.750
type of the result produced by the operation. Something

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.940
else you can notice in this representation is the

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.450
fact that there is a minus before these attributes

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.810
and a plus before this operation. This indicates what is

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.739
called the visibility of these class members. So the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.950
minus indicates that the attributes are private to the class.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.600
So only instances of this class, roughly speaking, can

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.340
access these attributes. And notice that this is what allows

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.030
to enforce the information hiding principle, because clients of

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.000
the class cannot see what's inside this box, what are

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.360
these attributes. The plus conversely indicates that this is a

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.850
public operation. So something that is visible outside the class.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.790
And, in fact, normally, this is what we use to

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.110
define the interface for my class. So we encapsulate the

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.730
state of the class and we make it accessible to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.370
the extent that we want and that is needed through

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.850
a set of public operations. Last thing I want to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.730
note is the use of these ellipses that we can

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.520
utilize if we want to indicate that there are more

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.400
attributes for example, or more operations. But we just don't

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.160
want to list them now. Okay now that we know what

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.020
a class is, and how it is represented, let's start

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.150
our analysis of our course management system. By identifying the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.530
relevant classes in the system, we need to bring back the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.270
description of our system. And what we want to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.389
do, is that we want to go through the description

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.840
and underline the relevant nouns in the description. And here

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.020
I encourage you to stop the video and to do

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.450
the exercise of underlying such nouns yourself before listening to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.910
my explanation into how I do it. For example in

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.030
this case I might want to underlined the registration manager which

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.820
is a noun and probably a relevant one. The scheduling

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.800
algorithm, also seems like a relevant concept, so

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.890
is the course. The course offerings, again, course offerings

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.930
over here. Definitely, the students seem to be a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.750
relevant noun and so is probably the registration form

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.140
and the professors. Okay, so, at this point, I

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.630
identified seven possible classes for my system. So, what

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.340
I'm going to do is simply to create classes for

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.980
each one of these nouns. So my initial class

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.100
diagram looks exactly like this, with the seven classes where

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.140
for each class, I picked the name that is representative of

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.680
the domain. So, in this case, it's pretty straightforward. The

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.950
registration form is called registration form, the student is called student

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.780
and so on and so forth. But you can already

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.490
see how this analysis method is starting from a description of

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.950
the real world and it's just identifying objects or classes

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.240
in the real world and transforming them into entities in my

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.260
analysis document.
