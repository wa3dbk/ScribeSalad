00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.590
As before, you'll create a new
application with a blank activity.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.840
Android Studio will take you to the
activity designer, and as you can see,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.840
here, it's populated with a very
basic hello world text field.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.630
I'm going to paste it in the UI
declaration for the activity recognition

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.790
app, and you'll see the code for this in
the instructor notes below the video.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.820
So, I'll just replace all
of this with my code.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.210
And my code, as you saw,
had the two buttons for

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.260
requesting activity updates and
for removing activity updates.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.950
And then this text view, which just
had the details of the activities.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.140
Now you'll see that
there are some errors.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.680
This is because I don't
have any strings set up.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.070
These are values that you
specify using XML files,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.600
keeping them separate
from the UI declaration.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.030
This is good practice.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.220
To this point in the course,
I've been hard coding them, but

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.010
that's not a best practice.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.750
I'm not going to go into
detail on explaining them now.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.090
Check out the Android fundamentals
courses, or the documentation for

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.140
how they work.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.350
It's pretty straightforward and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.920
once you've done it a few times,
it becomes second nature.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.930
I'm just going to paste
in these string values.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.480
And you can get the code
from the instructor notes.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.742
Strings are in res &gt;
values &gt; strings.xml.

00:01:09.742 --> 00:01:11.580
You can see there isn't much in here.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.660
And I'm going to paste the new stuff in.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.760
So now I've pasted in all the different
string resources that I'm going to be

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.040
using in this application.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.370
And if I go back to my layout file,
we'll see that the red has gone away,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.460
that those errors are now fixed.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.875
Next, as you've done before,

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:29.990
you'll need to update your build.gradle
to use the services libraries.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.165
Build.gradle can be found in your
gradle scripts, and that's the one for

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:34.365
the module app.

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:35.745
And you can see it here.

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:39.115
I'm just going to paste it
in my Play services version.

00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:42.075
Do remember that when you're building
this to check the version of

00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:42.895
the library.

00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:45.640
I'm just using 6.5.+ here.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.240
If you have a later version
of the library, use that, and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.710
also try to use the specific latest
version of the library you have on your

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.060
machine as we demonstrated earlier.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.730
For the purpose of keeping things
simple, I'm putting the plus in here,

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.480
but that's bad practice.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.320
Also, the name may change.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.390
Just look out in the documentation.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.950
At the moment its called
com.google.android.gns:play-services,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.340
but this name may change over time,
so just keep an eye out for that.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.860
Once you're done with that, you also
need to update the app manifest.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.590
The first thing your going to add to the
app manifest are details on the services

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.380
libraries that you're going to use.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.060
You enter these just above
the closing application tag and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.740
I'm just going to paste mine in.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.030
You see right now it has red indicating
an error, but when I do my next grade,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.300
I think that'll go away.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.720
You don't need to worry about that.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.760
And the final thing that you
have to add to your app manifest

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.310
is the ability to use
the activity recognition APIs.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.240
And you do this with
a user's permission tag.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.480
So, I'm just going to go to
underneath my application tag, and

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.670
I'll paste in the user's permission.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.700
So you can see, I'm just setting
it to user's permission.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.720
And the Android name is
the activity recognition details.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.770
So now my manifest is set up,
my build.gradle is set up.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.020
So I've done everything I need for

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.550
my project to work for
activity recognition.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.510
So now all we have to do is
actually write the project.
