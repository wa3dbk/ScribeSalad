00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
Now, one of the interesting things about customer development

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.630
that makes startups very different from large companies

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.230
is that customer development is done by the founders.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.730
Why the founders?

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.650
It turns out that there's a couple of interesting things,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.220
and this is about human nature. There's no technology involved.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.230
In a traditional startup in the old days, you would hire a VP of sales

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.880
who would go out because you were smart, this was your idea, and you'd say,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.060
"Go try to sell this. Go talk to customers. I'll just hire somebody to do this."

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.040
But remember, an employee doesn't have the vision.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.610
They're just executing what you told them.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.250
And guess what happens if they go out and talk to people who say,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.920
"This is the worst idea we ever heard," or "No, we won't buy it."

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.250
What happens is they'll come back and tell you in the first time they do this,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.430
and you'll say, "Well, you're just not describing it right."

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.920
And you send them back out for another couple of days or weeks or months,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.620
and they'll come back again.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.650
And if you're like any passionate founder, you'll go, "I hired the wrong executive. You're fired."

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.209
Now just imagine we run the exercise this time not with a proxy head of sales or marketing,

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.470
but we force you to get out, you the founder to start talking to customers.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.480
And if you got that same exact feedback, it might take you 3 customers

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.370
or 5 or 30, but eventually, smoke will start coming out of your ears

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.870
because cognitive dissonance is now coming into effect.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.480
It's that you might realize that your story or vision isn't right.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.080
But unlike a proxy, a VP of sales or marketing,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.080
you have the power to change the company's strategy.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.400
You have the power to change the entire value proposition, to say,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.530
"What if we had these features?"

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.200
And customers might say, "Nah, nah, nah, still not."

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.760
But then if you said, "Well, what if we had this?" they might say,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.260
"Oh, if you could do that, you could have my check right now."

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.800
If you're a smart founder you'd say, "Let me get right back to you,"

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.560
because what you'll do is you'll go test that new feature with 5 or 10 other customers.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.420
And all of a sudden you realize that you had the wrong feature set

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.090
and just by adding this small, little change,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.920
you can now actually get a whole series of paying customers.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.160
Only founders could do that.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.400
And what we did in the past is we would wait till first customer ship,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.280
we'd wait till sales didn't match the revenue plan,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.050
and we'd actually make these changes by firing executives

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.540
instead of actually having the founders engage in Day 1.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.540
So it's the founder who could change the product, make pivots,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.790
and hear customer feedback firsthand.

00:02:25.790 --> 99:59:59.000
And that's the idea of getting the founder outside the building.
