00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.029
Here's how I figured it out. If I look at an arbitrary point, x and y, where as

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.933
always in our graphical coordinate systems, x grows this way and y grows this

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:13.367
way, downward. And it's clear that the x value here has nothing to do with

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:19.130
which color to chose. But the y value does, so I have to worry about the y

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.981
value being. Greater than or maybe greater equal, we'll come back to that in a

00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:29.322
minute, then half the height. Now if it's greater than or greater than equal,

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:33.570
or less than or less than equal, it's easy if it would make these things wrong.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.724
So, let's look at the actual numbers. Let's assume that the height is 200. In

00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:44.578
that case the Y values can be from 0 to 199. So, if they're from 0 to 99 then I

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:51.579
want red. And if they're from 100 to 199 then I want white. So, if height is

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.854
200 then height is over 2 is 100. Greater or equal than 100 should give me

00:00:56.854 --> 00:01:01.662
wide. So, this is exactly the right condition, we'll put it in here and

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:07.060
otherwise I want Red. Let me put it in and demo it to you. I'll just make a

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.010
flag, many flags as I want in a half times as wide as they are tall and I'll

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:21.341
use the same here. And here it is. Red on top, white on the bottom. Let's move

00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:24.523
on to a more complicated flag.
