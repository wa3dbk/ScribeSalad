00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.019
So now you've seen that you can encode four things

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.770
in bits. You can encode any number, we just need more

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.560
bits. So if we have more bits, we can encode

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.500
more different things. So, here I've got four bits. That means

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.988
I have four yes, no choices. And I can encode

00:00:15.988 --> 00:00:19.680
sixteen different numbers. And the reason for that is because 2

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.800
to the 4 is 16. Every time I add one

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.450
more bit, I double the number of things. Because I have

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.970
one more yes, no question. So for just this part

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.840
of the graph, I had eight things, I had three bits.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.120
I could distinguish between the numbers zero through seven. Adding one

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.720
more bit, doubles the number of things I can distinguish. So

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.800
that's a way to measure information. And once we can distinguish

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.250
any number of things. Well, we can send any kind of

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.680
data we want. Anything that's discreet, we can turn into a

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.540
number. So we could turn letters into numbers. If we have

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.322
a long string, we could have a sequence of numbers, which

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:56.710
we can turn into one really big number. So, once we can

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.820
send bits, we can send anything we want. So that's what

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.580
bandwidth is. It's a measure of the amount of information that we

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.820
can send, and we're measuring the number of bits. Each bit

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.000
is one yes or no decision. In computing, we usually think of

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.810
that as either a 0 or 1. So that long stream of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.670
0's and 1's is the information we're sending. And it could be

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.463
encoding a string of text like a dozen of web

00:01:18.463 --> 00:01:21.211
page. It could be encoding an image, it could be

00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:24.310
encoding a number. And to measure our bandwidth, we need

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.600
to know how many bits can we send per second.
