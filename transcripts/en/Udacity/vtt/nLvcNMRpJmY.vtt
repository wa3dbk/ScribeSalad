00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.172
This is a really important optimization pattern, so let me emphasize it.

00:00:03.172 --> 00:00:07.411
In practice, most well-tuned GPU codes are memory-limited. I'll repeat that.

00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:11.665
Most, not all, but most GPU codes are memory-limited.

00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:16.919
So, always start by measuring your achieved bandwidth to see if you're using memory efficiently.

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:18.719
And if not, ask yourself, why not?
