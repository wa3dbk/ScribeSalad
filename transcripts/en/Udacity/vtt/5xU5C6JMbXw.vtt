00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.336
When finding the sum of polynomials, we want to identify like terms first. I

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:08.676
have 3x squared y squared, and negative 14, x squared, y squared, these are

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:13.666
like-terms because they're the same variables with the same exponents. Negative

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:18.812
8xy and negative 2xy are also like terms, so I can list those together, down

00:00:18.812 --> 00:00:23.837
here. These last two terms are tricky, they're actually not like, so I can only

00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:28.787
list them separately, I won't be able to combine them, or add them. Now I simply

00:00:28.787 --> 00:00:32.879
count up the number of x squareds y squared that I have, I have positive 3 and

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.182
negative 14 of them, so that's a total of negative 11. For the next term, I have

00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:41.441
negative 8xy, and negative 2xy, so that makes negative 10xy altogether. And

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:46.049
finally, we just list these terms as sums on the end, because they're not like

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.710
with anything else in our expression, so here's our answer.
