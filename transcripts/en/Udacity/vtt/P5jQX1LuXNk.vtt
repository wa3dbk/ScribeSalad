00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.390
Now that you've seen how
classes are built in Swift, so

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.870
many new possibilities
will open up to you.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.750
These are the moving parts that
will make your application tick.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.060
This is a turning point.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.890
So be sure to take the time
to master these concepts and

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.270
complete the exercises on classes,
properties and methods.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.990
Next up enum's and structs.
