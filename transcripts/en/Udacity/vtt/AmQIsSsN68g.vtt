00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.482
Well I know this negative exponent will move to the numerator. So I have y to

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:09.301
the 5th times y to the 4th, next we add the exponents together to get y to the

00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:14.062
9th. Excellent work if you got that one correct. If you use exponents rules you

00:00:14.062 --> 00:00:18.866
would have done y to the 5th minus negative 4. We subtract the second exponent,

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.835
this also leaves us with y to the 9th, our answer.
