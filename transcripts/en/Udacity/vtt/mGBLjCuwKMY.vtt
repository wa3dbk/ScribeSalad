00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:04.606
So let's look at a demo. This is what the example white balance routine looks like in Matlab.

00:00:04.606 --> 00:00:07.983
As you can see it's quite short. Matlab is a high level programming language.

00:00:07.983 --> 00:00:12.533
It's got a simple syntax and a whole lot of built in math and engineering functions.

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.980
So this whole routine can be written in just 6 lines of code.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.512
Now the way this is written out, currently this function runs entirely on a CPU.

00:00:18.512 --> 00:00:21.340
And so next what we're going to do is use the Matlab profiler

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.992
to identify sections of this code that might be candidates to run on GPU to improve performance.

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:31.035
So we run the profiler and it indicates that this last line is by far the most time consuming.

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:35.838
This line of code is applying an operation to each color channel across every pixel on the image.

00:00:35.838 --> 00:00:39.294
Such an operation could be sped up when executed on a GPU.

00:00:39.294 --> 00:00:41.658
This is clearly a good candidate for parallel computing.

00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:45.684
So before using the GPU, let's first measure how long it takes to execute the white balance function

00:00:45.684 --> 00:00:48.502
on the CPU, using the tick and tock commands.

00:00:48.502 --> 00:00:53.521
Notice that it takes approximately 0.124 seconds to execute the code entirely on the CPU.

00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:58.447
Now to utilize the GPU for executing that last line of code, there's a couple of options.

00:00:58.447 --> 00:01:01.166
One thing that we could do is simply transfer the image data

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.764
to the GPU memory using the GPU array command.

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:07.913
And that's what we're doing here on line 14 of this slightly modified white balance routine.

00:01:07.913 --> 00:01:12.557
Whenever a GPU is passed as input to the most common core Matlab functions,

00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:17.696
as in this last line of code, then those computations will automatically be executed on the GPU.

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:20.363
So, here by adding just that single line of code,

00:01:20.363 --> 00:01:23.555
notice that the time it takes to execute the white balance function

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:26.989
went down from 0.124 seconds to 0.026 seconds.

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:29.738
So that's a big speed up, especially for a single line of code.

00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:33.758
So the second approach to using the GPU for computing within Matlab

00:01:33.758 --> 00:01:36.714
is to use the Matlab interface to invoke custom Cuda kernels.

00:01:36.714 --> 00:01:40.359
Here's a Cuda kernel that performs the same operation that was causing

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.635
that original bottleneck in the white balance routine.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:46.357
And in this Matlab function, that Cuda kernel is being used

00:01:46.357 --> 00:01:49.229
to speed up the execution time instead of using GPU array.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.832
So the first 12 lines of code are the same as in the original white balance routine.

00:01:52.832 --> 00:01:56.819
Then, however, Matlab loads the kernel and sets up the threading parameters,

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.651
Creates data on the GPU, and finally invokes the kernel using f eval.

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:06.975
And now notice that the white balance routine executes in .022 seconds using the Cuda kernel.

00:02:06.975 --> 00:02:11.881
So the application executes faster but we should still verify that our Cuda does what its supposed to do.

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.057
So we need ask the question, do the results from the GPU

00:02:14.057 --> 00:02:16.173
match the results that we were getting on the CPU?

00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:19.204
And you can check that the outputs match, using this simple script

00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:21.793
which computes the norm of the difference between outputs.

00:02:21.793 --> 00:02:24.526
So a norm equal to 0, signifies that the 2 outputs are the same.

00:02:24.526 --> 00:02:29.762
After running verified script, we can see that the 2 outputs are the same, and there we go.

00:02:29.762 --> 00:02:32.865
So, in summary, Matlab is a nice high-level language.

00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:35.787
It is used heavily by scientists and engineers all over the world

00:02:35.787 --> 00:02:38.725
for all kinds of applications, and its a great way to quickly design

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:43.768
and test algorithms that perform computations on a GPU, either by using the gpuArray command,

00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:46.140
or by using an interface directly to CUDA kernels.

00:02:46.147 --> 00:02:50.097
Furthermore, existing CUDA kernels can be quickly and easily tested inside Matlab.

00:02:50.097 --> 00:02:55.190
It makes a great harness for developing an exploring and testing CUDA kernels.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.312
And that's Matlab.
