00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.977
This number line is the correct answer. We know that m is supposed to be smaller

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:07.814
than n or equal to n. So we need to have a bracket that includes n to square 1.

00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:11.621
And also select all of the values to the left of n on the number line. Another

00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:15.391
thing to note is that the quantity we're thinking about, which is m in our case,

00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:19.353
is conveniently written to the lower right-hand hand corner of the number line.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:23.139
You'll continue to see this on different number lines in the future with

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:26.710
different variable names, depending on what we're searching for.
