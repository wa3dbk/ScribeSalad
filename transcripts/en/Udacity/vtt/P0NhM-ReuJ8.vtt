It should print 12, and 3 plus 4 plus 5 with all the spaces. This might have

00:00:05.986 --> 00:00:09.726
been different from what you expected. We didn't use quotation marks here. The

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:15.856
quotation marks mark literal text. If we use quotes, it means that we want to

00:00:15.856 --> 00:00:23.445
write 3 plus 4 plus 5 as it is. But when we don;t use quotes, the computer

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:28.620
reads 3 plus 4 plus 5 as numbers. It knows how to add the numbers, so it added

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.819
the numbers and then it printed the result as you can see here. You can use

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:38.899
system.out.println to print numbers and text
