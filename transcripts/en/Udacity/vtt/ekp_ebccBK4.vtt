Earlier on, we looked at the graph of y equals 3 x minus 5. We saw that we got

00:00:04.853 --> 00:00:10.051
this line. Thinking about your new understanding of what the slope of a line is,

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:15.361
can you tell me how many units up, for every unit across to the right, this line

00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:20.147
goes? It can be helpful to start at a point on the line and draw a right

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:24.850
triangle, first moving out to the right and then up, to help you figure this

00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:25.082
out.
