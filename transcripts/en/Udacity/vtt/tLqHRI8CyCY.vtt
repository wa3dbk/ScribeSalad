00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.892
In the last lesson, we implemented several classes but their behavior was

00:00:02.892 --> 00:00:05.774
pretty simple. But, what if we want to do something a little bit more

00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:07.590
complicated, like the day class?

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.710
&gt;&gt; In that case, you'd need to know more about working with numbers and Java.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.879
That's what we'll cover in this lesson. I think I work with text more than

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.554
numbers when I program. Well, actually, that's what I do too and we'll cover

00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:20.568
text processing, as well. In this lesson, you'll learn what java has to offer

00:00:20.568 --> 00:00:22.991
for working with numbers and text.
