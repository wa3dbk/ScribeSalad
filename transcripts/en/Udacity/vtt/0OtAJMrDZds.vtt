00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.480
Now, once again I've laid out a function for you, in the same format as before.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.355
We have one oval that contains some possible values of x, and another oval that

00:00:09.355 --> 00:00:14.080
contains some possible values of f of x, and some values of x mapping to other

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.469
values of f of x. So, using this diagram, I'd like you to tell me what the

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:23.180
domain of this function is, and what the range is. And as before, if you have

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.467
multiple answers in either box, please separate them by commas.
