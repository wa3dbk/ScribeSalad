00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.750
So let me start with some examples that motivate the

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.330
need for very fine software. The first example I want to

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.580
use is the famous Arian five. And if you remember

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.060
that's a rocket that exploded not too long after departure.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.800
Because of a software error. And even without going to

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.400
such dramatic examples. I'm sure you're all familiar with this

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.470
kind of situation. Or this one, or again in this

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.070
one. And here I'm not really picking on any specific organization,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.280
operating system or software. The point I want to make is that software is

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.730
buggy. In fact, a federal report from

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.810
a few years ago assessed that software bugs

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.300
are costing the US economy, $60 billion

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.120
every year. In addition, studies have shown that

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.810
software contains on average one to five

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.472
bugs every 1000 lines of code. Building 100%

00:00:51.472 --> 00:00:55.940
correct mass-market software is just impossible. And if

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.270
this is the case, what can we do?

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.520
What we need to do is to verify software as much as possible. In this part of

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.750
the course, we will discuss how we can

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.480
do this. We will discuss different alternative ways

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.980
of very fine software systems. With particular attention

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.570
to the most common type of verification. Which is

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.470
software testing. Before doing that however, let

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.090
me go over some basic terms that are

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.190
commonly used. And I have to say,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.330
often misused in the context of software verification.
