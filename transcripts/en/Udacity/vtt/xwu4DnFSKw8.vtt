00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.452
As we move from the point 1,7 to the point 5,3, our x-coordinate moves to the

00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:10.651
right, 1, 2, 3, 4. This is the positive direction so we can say that our

00:00:10.663 --> 00:00:16.071
increase in x is positive 4. Now y, on the other hand, as we move from here to

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:21.427
here, has to step down, 1, 2, 3, 4. So, we actually have a decrease of 4 and y.

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:27.781
A decrease is the same as a negative increase. So, our increase in y is negative

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:33.799
4. We know the slope is just the increase in y divided by the increase in x, so

00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:37.278
our slope is negative 4 over 4 or negative 1.
