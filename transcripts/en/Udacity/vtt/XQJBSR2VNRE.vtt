00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.230
Let's answer our NUMA
memory allocation quiz.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.300
In order to improve
performance of a NUMA machine,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.010
the operating system should really put
all data pages that are mostly accessed

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.930
by a single core in the memory
slice local to that core.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.400
That will ensure that most of
the accesses by each of the cores

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.480
are going to the local memory.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.530
Which both makes sure that accesses will
be quicker than they otherwise would be

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.970
and also the network will not be
used for the majority of accesses.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.890
So this should be selected.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.250
If we, however, put all data pages ever
touched by core N in the memory slice N,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
then we have a problem because, for
example, one core might initialize all

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.390
the data, and then we put all
of the data in its memory slice.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.200
And at that point, that memory slice
becomes the bottleneck because

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.960
everybody will be accessing that slice,
and the data might not even fit there.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.470
So this is not a correct answer.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.140
And then put the stack pages for
core N in the memory slice N

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.200
is a very extreme example of this where
really it will just be the core N

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.830
that is ever accessing this data, so of
course it should be in its memory slice.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.580
So the stack is one of those things

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.940
that the operating system can figure
out very easily where to put.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.380
Some of the other pages are a little
bit more difficult because

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.700
more than one core are accessing it.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.420
And then the operating system
needs to choose a good location

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.330
either because one core is accessing
it more than others, or to put it in

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.240
a memory module that is kind of close
to all the cores that are accessing it.
