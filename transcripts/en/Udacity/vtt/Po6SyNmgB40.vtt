We know inequality's can be solved just like equations. But there is one

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:08.157
exception. An inequality sign behaves different when you multiply or divide both

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:12.286
sides by a negative value. Let's look at that. I am going to start by not doing

00:00:12.298 --> 00:00:16.572
division or multiplication, I am going to do subtraction. First, I subtract one

00:00:16.584 --> 00:00:21.346
from both sides, and I get 1 is greater than 0. Then, I can subtract 2 from both

00:00:21.358 --> 00:00:25.791
sides and I get negative 1 is greater than negative 2. This causes a lot of

00:00:25.803 --> 00:00:30.655
trouble for students. Let's look at this. Here's negative 1 and here's negative

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:35.217
2. We know negative 1 is closer to 0, it's further to the right on the number

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:40.044
line, so it must be bigger in value compared to negative 2. But we're not after

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:44.234
comparing numbers here. We want to know about the inequality sign. I've

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:48.399
rewritten negative 1 is greater than negative 2 and instead of doing the

00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:52.884
subtraction twice, what if we just would've multiplied? If we multiplied both

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:58.508
sides of our inequality by negative 1, we'll get negative 2 and negative 1. But

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.305
I can't just carry my inequalities straight down. We know negative 1 is greater

00:01:03.317 --> 00:01:08.043
than negative 2, so the sign has to reverse in direction. The same is true when

00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:12.647
dividing by a negative 1. We know when we divide by a negative 1, we change the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.319
signs of the numbers. So, I'll still need to flip my inequality sign. These

00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:22.261
inequalities might look different, but they're actually equivalent statements.

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:26.995
Here, I have negative 1 is greater than negative 2, and here, I have negative 2

00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:31.729
is less than negative 1. If we flip this entire inequality, we can see that we

00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:36.558
wind up with the same thing. We get negative 2 is less than negative 1. The key

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.414
thing to remember when solving inequality problems is to reverse the direction

00:01:41.426 --> 00:01:45.275
of the sign when you multiply or divide both sides by a negative.
