00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
As a conclusion, I hope you all agree that programming is fun.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So often it's more fun to write a program code to implement things like union

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
rather than finding a built-in way to do this, but it did mean that if we want to improve

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
as programmers, we need to learn new things and the way to do that is try solving problems.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But as you solve problems to learn the things that are useful to solve those problems on the way.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And a great way to do that is to try to build things using the tools that you have already

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and then to look for new tools that would make that more easy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In this unit, we saw a simple example of that whereby knowing about list

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
you could learn about sets that have different properties and make it much easier

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to implement things like union because that's a built-in operation for sets.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So as a challenge, I want to encourage to try to learn more new things about Python

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and one way to do that would be to make the search engine code shorter to figure out ways

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to do things that we had to write a lot of code for by using built-in parts of Python.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
There are lots and lots of opportunities for doing this with the provided search engine code.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Thanks for your attention, and I look forward to seeing you're much improved code in the forums.
