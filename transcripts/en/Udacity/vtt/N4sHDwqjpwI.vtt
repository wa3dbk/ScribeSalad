00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:06.500
The boat travels 576 miles in either direction. Great work if you found this.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.158
We can find this answer by plugging in the value of x which is 84 and take each

00:00:10.158 --> 00:00:14.665
of these expressions. Either expression will give us the correct answer, so

00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:19.442
let's make sure. If we take the expression for distance for upstream and

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:25.947
replace the value of x with 84, we see that the answer is 576. The same would

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:31.143
be true for downstream. We replace x with 84 to get 504 plus 72 which equals

00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:37.357
576. This should make sense that the distances are equal. The boat travel

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:42.500
downstream first and then it went back the same distance to return. So, this

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.100
supports our reasoning for how we solve the equation and we know the boat

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.390
traveled 576 miles in each direction.
