This diagram is correct. It initially takes d N as it's input and then gives N

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:10.475
of d as an output. Then N of d acts as the input for the second machine, which

00:00:10.475 --> 00:00:15.470
spits out R of N of d. That's pretty cool. I know this notation probably looks

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.279
kind of funny right now but we'll learn all about it, in the next few videos.
