00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.142
I'd like us to just go through a couple more examples using factoring by

00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:08.932
grouping with higher order polynomials. I know this isn't really that different

00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:13.342
from factoring quadratic polynomials, but I think it's worth it to get some

00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:18.174
practice. How would you factor 4x cubed minus 12x squared plus 2x minus 6? Make

00:00:18.174 --> 00:00:21.944
sure that at the end you check the factors you've multiplied together to see if

00:00:21.944 --> 00:00:24.173
any of them have common factors within them.
