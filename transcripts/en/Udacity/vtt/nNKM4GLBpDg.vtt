00:00:00.417 --> 00:00:03.123
I'll show you how we can add
breakpoints in our code.

00:00:03.123 --> 00:00:07.129
Go ahead and click on the screen bug icon
to attach the debugger.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.619
We'll go to the Settings menu.
In the SettingsActivity,

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.169
I'm going to add two breakpoints
in the onPreferenceChange method.

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.778
I'm going to add a breakpoint at line 59
in the case of a ListPreference

00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:24.922
when it's about to set the summary.

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:28.808
I'm also going to add a breakpoint
at line 63 when it's not a ListPreference

00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:33.194
and it sets the summary.
Let's go into the app to try it out.

00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:35.816
Tap on the Location
and change the postal code.

00:00:35.816 --> 00:00:40.329
If you hit OK then it triggers
the breakpoint to stop right here.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.962
These are the values
of the variables at this time,

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:47.178
and we see the new postal code here.
You can step over or into the method

00:00:47.178 --> 00:00:52.839
for more details, or you can hit Play
to continue, or Stop to stop the debugger.

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.763
Let's hit Play to continue. And then
we see that the UI has been updated

00:00:57.763 --> 00:01:01.238
so that the preference summary
is the new postal code.

00:01:01.238 --> 00:01:07.055
Let's try it for Temperature Units.
We tap here, and then select Imperial.

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:10.369
It triggers this breakpoint
in the ListPreference case.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.444
We hit Play to continue,
and then we see

00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:24.072
that Imperial is now
the preference summary.
