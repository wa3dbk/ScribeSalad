00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's now go and make this a full capture replay tool,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which comes in to mode either replay or record.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is set by the mode variable.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If we are in recording mode, then we want to

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
store the commands in variable save commands.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We are in replay mode, however.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Then we assume we already do have some stored commands in here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now for another programming exercise.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Go and extend input command, such that if it is in replay mode,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the commands are being read from the saved commands variable.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Over to you.
