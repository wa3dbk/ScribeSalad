00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.230
Say I'm trying to build a game that
let's people build their own robots but

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.050
I'm not sure what I want
the icon to look like.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.012
Let's consider these three options for
an icon and decide on a best design.

00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:14.160
Our first choice,
is a picture of nuts and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.120
bolts that says robot on it and
this one is not very good.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.030
I don't think I'd be able to read
the label if it gets any smaller,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.900
like if it's displayed on my phone.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.290
And the colors aren't very eye catching.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.980
The second is a picture of a large R.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.660
This one is readable and
has a nice bold green background but

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.260
it doesn't really tell me
what the game's about.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.740
Labels like this work for established
brands, think of the Facebook F but

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.960
otherwise, a person browsing
will more want more information.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.960
And the last option is, a picture of a
robot with the screw going in his head.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.290
It's colorful and descriptive.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.775
We immediately know that the game Is
about robots, and there's no small text.

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:55.755
So, this looks like the best choice.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:58.965
The next thing a person will see
in the app store after your icon,

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:00.845
is the game screenshots and description.

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:02.415
So, let's learn more about these next.
