00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.928
So, is masturbation normal?

00:00:01.928 --> 00:00:07.076
&gt;&gt; So masturbation or self love, or self pleasuring, has a couple of different

00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:12.536
names yes it's, it's normal for people to have feelings of loving themself or

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:18.350
touching themself. At least from like a biological point of view, totally

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.044
normative. although there are rare exceptions to that of course. Some people's

00:00:23.044 --> 00:00:27.677
sexual orientation happens to be asexual. and they might not have any desire

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:32.098
whatsoever to engage in self-love or self-touch, but on average across the

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:36.253
globe, most humans engage in some sort of self-touch, unless the society,

00:00:36.253 --> 00:00:42.712
culture, religion. dictates otherwise and then they might not engage in that,

00:00:42.712 --> 00:00:46.952
but in general there are lots of reasons why people masturbate, masturbate. It

00:00:46.952 --> 00:00:51.972
relieves sexual tension. it provides a venue for self exploration it can be a

00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:56.388
shared experience so people might engage in mutual masturbation either where

00:00:56.388 --> 00:01:00.484
they masturbate each other or they might just engage in self touch in front of

00:01:00.484 --> 00:01:07.615
each other. and it can people physically relax so it can relieve just physical

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:12.389
pressure that someone might have or daily stress. One of the things I, I really

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:15.675
recommend for people though is they should be masturbating in a way that's

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:21.186
congruent with their own beliefs. and so, if it's something that makes them

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:24.306
feel uncomfortable, then, then they should, you know, back off and figure out

00:01:24.306 --> 00:01:29.028
another way to do things that might make them feel better. There are tons of

00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:33.430
techniques that people can use, from just using digital masturbation with their

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.305
hands to toys to water to. you know, another partner so on and so forth. And so

00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:42.856
there's lots of different ways that people can masturbate, and they really just

00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:46.248
have to find one that, that is congruent with their own beliefs, and that they

00:01:46.248 --> 00:01:50.665
enjoy, and that's comfortable and healthy for them.

00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:54.503
&gt;&gt; So how can sexual behavior actually be used as a motivator?

00:01:54.503 --> 00:02:02.634
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I, definitely, there are motivations that people have for having sex.

00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:08.320
there are, in the United States, there's three primary reasons for having sex.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.012
Or, kind of, the motivation behind having sex. the first is for traditional or

00:02:13.012 --> 00:02:19.722
reproductive reasons. About 30% of U.S. Americans really believe in this

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:24.507
traditional reporductive framework. And what I mean by that is, they really

00:02:24.507 --> 00:02:30.090
think that the number one motivation for sex is to procreate, to have children.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.146
And typically that's within the confines of a, a monogamous relationship.

00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:40.250
typically one that's either domestic partnered or, or a marital relationship.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.910
So in terms of motivation about 30% of the time it has something to do with,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.650
with actual procreation and, and attempting to, to make children. The next big

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.930
reason is typically a recreational reason or motivation about 25% of people in

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.413
the U.S are having sex for those reason. and it does tend to be more men than

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:06.227
women. and recreationally means that in said in it's simplest way, if it feels

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:11.804
good, it doesn't hurt anybody then let's do it. and and like I said that's

00:03:11.804 --> 00:03:16.171
about a quarter of the people and typically more men than women. And the final

00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:19.953
big motivator for sex or reason behind sex is a relational point of view and

00:03:19.953 --> 00:03:26.016
that's actually become the most common reason or motivator for sex. It's about

00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:31.530
45% of the people in the United States. And this is this idea that sex ideally

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.150
should be accompanied with strong feelings, or affection for someone, but not

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.120
necessarily for procreation, not really for procreation, and not really only in

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.978
the confines of a monogamous or a partnered or A marital context and again,

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:52.998
most people right now at least in the U.S view sex as being more of this

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:59.575
relational viewpoint and that's the main motivation. So, I really like someone

00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:04.075
and I don't want to be married but I still want to be close with them and

00:04:04.075 --> 00:04:10.054
intimate with them. And so I'm going to have sex with them. That's, that's

00:04:10.054 --> 00:04:13.418
typically the most common motivation right now is really this kind of

00:04:13.418 --> 00:04:17.084
affectional or feeling based motivation for sex.

00:04:17.084 --> 00:04:20.036
&gt;&gt; So is there anything else people need to know about human sexuality?

00:04:20.036 --> 00:04:23.364
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's helpful for people to understand a couple of things around

00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:26.952
sexuality, whether it's their motivations or a social component to sexuality

00:04:26.952 --> 00:04:30.072
and that is, what I always tell my students is that if you can't talk about

00:04:30.072 --> 00:04:37.006
sex, you probably shouldn't be having sex. And so if people can't engage in

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:41.834
some sort of basic dialogue about their sexual wants, needs, experiences past

00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:46.094
practices, future practices, health, if there's a history of sexually

00:04:46.094 --> 00:04:52.534
transmitted infection or disease. If you can't have conversations about sex,

00:04:52.534 --> 00:04:56.098
you probably don't have much business engaging in it, at least not with someone

00:04:56.098 --> 00:05:00.678
other than yourself. So, that's really the biggest point that I think people,

00:05:00.678 --> 00:05:03.765
regardless of the lesson that we're giving them, that's really the biggest

00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:07.530
lesson that they need to know around, human sexuality.
