00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.520
As I mentioned earlier, Quicksilver was done in

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.880
the early 80s, and here is a sketch reproduced

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.870
from their paper. An interesting thing that you

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.016
notice is that this sketch is very similar to

00:00:11.016 --> 00:00:13.046
what I showed you as the current structure

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:16.410
of network operating systems in the earlier panel. It's

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.740
a microkernel based design and Quicksilver was the

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.600
same vintage as Mach from CMU. And having seen

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.120
the structure of operating systems in

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.560
earlier lessons, this picture should be very

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.770
familiar to you, that all the system

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.190
services are provided above the microkernel. And

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.500
the microkernel is only responsible for Process

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.420
Management, IPC, and Machine Control, and all

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.120
of the system services such as Window

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.300
Manager, File System, Virtual Memory, and Communication,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.550
all of them sit above the microkernel,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.740
and the system services are implemented as

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.350
server processes. Now, the late 80's was

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.070
exciting time for distributed systems. There were no

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.940
laptops in that time. We were moving

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.680
from CRT terminals, Cathode Ray Terminals, connected to

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.870
mainframe to the era of office workstations,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.920
what we routinely call as desktops these days.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.060
Quicksilver was conceived as a workstation operating

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.870
system. And the ideas that are enshrined

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.560
in the Quicksilver operating system predates over

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.070
concurrent with many things that we take for

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.330
granted today, such as network file system,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.120
remote procedure call, the Internet, the World Wide

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.170
Web, and so on. What sets Quicksilver

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.330
apart from the competition at that time when

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.630
new services such as window manager for managing the real estate on the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.910
workstation screen and how it should be

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.780
integrated into the operating system as a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.350
whole? Services that may not be available

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.520
in the workstation itself, for example, a

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.600
file server maybe remote. So integrating communication

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
into the design of the operating system

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.260
was key and services that are within a workstation and across workstation

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.660
on the network in the distributed system need to recover from failures. Rather

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.290
than ad hoc mechanism for each server to recover from such failures, Quicksilver

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.420
was the first to propose transaction

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.470
as a unifying concept for recovery management

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.723
of the servers. It was the first

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:39.557
operating system to propose transactions in operating systems

00:02:39.557 --> 00:02:42.610
and that's the reason you see transaction manager

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.811
as part of the service provided by the

00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:48.370
operating system. A quick personal note, I

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.905
was a graduate student at University of Wisconsin,

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.780
Madison in the early '80s, and spent a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.210
year in IBM research working with the group

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.740
that conceived and designed this Quicksilver operating

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.100
system. My dissertation research, which was on

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.370
hardware support for inter process communication, used

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.990
as an experimental platform, a precursor to

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.250
the Quicksilver operating system which is called

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.760
925. Recall what I told you earlier

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.360
that Quicksilver was intended as a workstation

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.650
operating system, and 925 was the name

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.350
of the operating system that was a precursor to Quicksilver.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.270
And as you can imagine this is a pun on

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.555
office workstation nine to five. That was the name given

00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:40.420
to internally to the precursor of the Quicksilver operating system.
