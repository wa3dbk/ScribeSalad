00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.980
In the second step of the category partition technique, the goal is

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.630
to Identify Categories. Where categories are

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.650
characteristics of each input element. So

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.490
let me illustrate what that means using an example. And to do

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.440
that I'm going to use again the example of the split program, as

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.830
we are already familiar with it and we kind of already played

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.110
with it. When we were talking about the generic black box approach.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.293
So let me bring back the program, and let me remind you

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:25.440
that what the program does is to take two inputs, a string and

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.560
the size, and it breaks down the string into chunks,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.300
whose length is size. If we look at the split program

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.330
there are two input elements, str and size so we going to

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.930
identify categories for these two. So starting from str, what are

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.228
the interesting characteristics of the string? In, in this step

00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:44.948
you're going to use your domain knowledge, your understanding of what a

00:00:44.948 --> 00:00:47.986
string is, and for example we might identify the length of

00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:50.528
the string and the content of the string as the two

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:53.840
main characteristics that we want to focus on. If we now

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.540
move our focus to size, the only characteristic I can really

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.340
think of for an integer is its value. So that's what

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.470
I'm going to mark here. So at the end of the step

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.030
what we have is that we have two categories. So two

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.930
interesting characteristics for the string input str, which are the length

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.940
and the content. And one category for the integer input size

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.480
which is its value. And notice that there's not only one solution.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.200
So there's not only one possibility.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.384
So that the specific characteristics that you

00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:22.800
will identify are somehow subjective. But the

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.630
important point is that you identify characteristics

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.259
that are meaningful and they sort of cover the main aspects of the

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.200
inputs, which is the case for the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.440
categories that we've identified in this example.
