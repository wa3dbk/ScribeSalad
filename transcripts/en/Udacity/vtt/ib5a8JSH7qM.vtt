00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.499
The first time you saw rational expressions in this course, was way early on

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.860
when we looked at rational inequalities. At this point I think we've setup a

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.210
great framework for us to understand rational inequalities a lot better than we

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.717
did before. So let's look at one now. How about this one. 2x minus 3 over x

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:21.900
minus 5 is greater than 0. Now I'd like us to find the solution set for this

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.768
inequality. All of the values of x that make this inequality true. To refresh

00:00:26.768 --> 00:00:29.992
your memory on how to do this, first I'd like you to find the critical values

00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:34.474
for this inequality. The values for x that make either the denominator or the

00:00:34.474 --> 00:00:40.150
numerator equal 0. These critical values split the number line into intervals.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.520
So check a value within each interval to see if it satisfies the inequality.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.345
Based on this, you can write the solution in inequality form. Remember that you

00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:52.941
can write backslash or and then a space, if you want to join inequalities or

00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:58.377
chain them together, if there's more than one region in the solution. Write

00:00:58.377 --> 00:01:00.659
your answer in this green box.
