00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.040
In addition to choosing the right chart type to show different relationships in

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.980
your data, you can leverage good design principles to

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.870
communicate clearly and efficiently.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.320
Let's examine one aspect of perception that can aid us in the design process.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.530
This topic is called pre-attentive processing, and

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.610
it allows us to instantly recognize parts of a visualization.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.880
Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.120
Take a look at all these digits, and

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.900
I want you to count how many times the digit nine appears.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.650
How many nines do you count and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.400
how many seconds do you think it took you to count them?

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.600
Enter those numbers here.
