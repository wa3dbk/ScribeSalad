00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.990
There are other ways we could have noticed this important feature

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.300
of the data set. But, there are also other ways, that

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.100
by jumping into a different analysis, we might have missed this.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.800
For example, if we just look at a five number summary

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.120
of the data, we might not notice this so easily. One

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.630
clue to the discreteness is that the 75th percentile is the

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.810
same as the maximum. We could also see this discreteness by

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.180
looking at how many distinct prices there are in the data set.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.360
So here it looks like there's about 20 different prices.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.119
Tabling the variable we get an idea of the distribution

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.650
like we saw in the histogram. So now that we

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.390
know something about the price, let's figure out on a given

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.760
purchase occasion how many eight ounce yogurts does a household

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.770
purchase. To answer this we need to combine accounts of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.590
the different yogurt flavors into one variable. For example, for

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.340
this particular household, on one purchase occasion, they bought three different

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.700
types of yogurt. To figure this out for all the households,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.300
we need to make use of a new function. The function

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.426
is called the transform function. Now I haven't introduced this function

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:03.290
yet, but I want you to look up the function and run

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.860
the examples of the code at the bottom of the documentation

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.360
to figure out what it does. See if you can create

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.300
a new variable called all.purchases, which gives the total counts of

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.410
yogurt for each observation or household purchase. Keep in mind that you

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.710
need to save this variable to the data frame,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.150
so this may or may not be in your syntax.
