00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.665
The solution to this compound inequality is from negative 5 to negative 2. When

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:08.930
we solve compound inequalities we need to solve each of the inequalities

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:13.235
independently and since they're connected with an AND, we're going to need to

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:17.745
look at the intersection of these two solutions. So let's solve this inequality

00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:22.020
first. I'm going to subtract 2x from both sides which gives me negative 1 is

00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:27.194
greater than. 2x plus 3. Subtract 3 from both sides, negative 4 is greater than

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:31.830
2x, divide both sides by 2, and I get negative 2 is greater than x. It's

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:36.781
important to know that negative 2 greater than x is the same as x is less than

00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:41.886
negative 2. So we have the solution to our first inequality. Let's solve our

00:00:41.898 --> 00:00:46.440
second inequality. This time I'm going to subtract 3 x from both sides. When I

00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:50.734
subtract 3 x from both sides, I get 2 x plus 3 is greater than or equal to

00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:55.522
negative 7. Subtract 3 from both sides, and I get 2x is greater than or equal to

00:00:55.534 --> 00:01:00.285
negative 10. Once again divide both sides by 2, and I get that x is greater than

00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:04.995
or equal to negative 5. Now that I've solved both inequalities, I have to see

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:09.710
where these intervals overlap. I'm going to use a number line. I'm going to draw

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:14.295
the solution to the two inequalities on top of this number line. X is less than

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:18.880
negative 2 uses a parenthesis. And the solution is less than negative 2. And,

00:01:18.982 --> 00:01:23.490
for x greater than or equal to negative 5, I have a square bracket at negative 5

00:01:23.502 --> 00:01:28.545
and my solution. Goes to the right. Since this is an AND inequality, we have to

00:01:28.557 --> 00:01:33.136
look at where these two intervals overlap. As you can see they overlap from

00:01:33.148 --> 00:01:37.845
negative 5 to negative 2, so I can draw the actual solution on the number line,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.640
which means from negative 5 to negative 2 and everything in between. Let's try

00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:44.415
another compound inequality.
