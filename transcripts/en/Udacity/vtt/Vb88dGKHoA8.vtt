00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.390
Android Wear uses voice throughout the
platform, and one of the best places to

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.410
see it in action is doing
replies to notifications.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.130
Normally when you touch
the reply action on a phone,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.120
it'll take you to an activity
to enter the text.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.500
On Android Wear, the user can touch this
reply button and then speak a reply and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.790
it is then converted into a string and
delivered to your app.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.240
Best of all, you can use this feature
with just a few lines of code,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.330
added to your existing
notifications on the phone.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.660
We use a class called
RemoteInput to implement this.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.710
We declare a string extra_voice_reply
that specifies the key

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.670
that will be delivered
to the intent later on.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.930
We also declare a label to
put on the text reply screen

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.040
telling the user what we
want them to speak to us.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.560
You then call build to get
the remote input object.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.140
Now we need to add the remote
input to our notification.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.390
You can see here we declare a pending
intent to receive the reply.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.990
We then create an action and

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.070
then we use addRemoteInput to use the
remote input object we created earlier.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.700
Then we use extend on the notification
to add a wearable extender, add action,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.870
and the action we just created.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.360
Everything is now linked together,
and we can issue the notification.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.580
This code will continue
to work on a phone, but

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.960
now we can have a reply action that
asks the user to speak a reply.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.230
So how do we get the reply string back?

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.820
The previous code is written to use
an activity called reply activity.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.940
Inside there, you can call get intent
to find details about the intent that

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.260
started the activity.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.800
Once you have the intent,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.670
you can pass it to the getMessageText
method shown here.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.040
We can then extract out the voice
reply using the key EXTRA_VOICE_REPLY,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.780
which returns a CharSequence
that was spoken by the user.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.340
And that's it.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.060
It's that easy.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.920
Speech recognition has traditionally
been very hard to do by yourself, and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.660
Android Wear takes care of all of it for
you.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.520
There is also support for
emoji entry in Android Wear, and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.540
these are automatically
handled on the wearable, and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.920
sent to your app as standard
emoji unicode characters.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.050
You don't always have
to use voice replies.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.740
Sometimes your user will be
unable to speak to the watch and

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.870
they might want to reply with
a set of pre canned replies.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.450
You can use the set choices method
to specify an array of options that

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.910
the user can select from to be
used along with a voice reply.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.350
And here's how you define
the array in the strings.xml file.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.620
It contains a set a strings that will
be given to the extra voice replied to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.830
find earlier.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.910
One more thing to note here,
if your using the Android wear emulator,

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.320
you'll have to type your
voice replies on a keyboard,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.710
since the emulator does not
support speech recognition.
