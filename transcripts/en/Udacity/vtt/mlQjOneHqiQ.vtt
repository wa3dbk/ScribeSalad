&gt;&gt; Now, we all know that you all love animated robots running around and

00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:08.332
shooting each other. I mean, after it all, it is good family friendly fun. But

00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:12.682
we also need to draw the environment map. We draw the environment map through

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:17.037
many of the same processes that we used to draw animated sprites. Firstly, all

00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:21.191
of our map data resides in one large atlas. This allows us to then simply call

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:25.067
the canvas.draw image tag to be able to draw subportions to our map.
