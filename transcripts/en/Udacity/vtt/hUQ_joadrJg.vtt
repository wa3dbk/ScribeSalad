00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.820
In this lesson we will cover a brief history of the internet. The internet has

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.350
its roots in the ARPA Net which was

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.260
conceived in, 1966 to connect big academic computers

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.010
together. The first operational ARPA Net nodes

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.680
came online, in 1969 at UCLA, SRI, UCSB,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.920
and Utah. Around the same time, the National

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.150
Physical Laboratory in the UK also came online.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.100
By 1971, there were about 20 ARPANet Nodes,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.770
and the first host-to-host protocol. There were two

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.200
cross country links, and all of the links

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.110
were at 50 KBPS. Here is a rough sketch

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.180
of the ARPANet as drawn by Larry Roberts in the late 1960s. You can see the four

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.960
original Nodes here, as well as some other

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.480
well known players, such as Berkeley. The MAC project

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.810
at MIT, BBN, Harvard, Carnegie-Mellon, Michigan, Illinois,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.160
Dartmouth, Stanford, and so forth. This is what

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.080
the ARPANET looked like in the late 1960s. Here's a picture of the ARPANET in

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.760
June 1974. And you can see not

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.270
only some additional networks that have come online,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.990
but also a diagram of the machines

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.540
that are connected at each of the universities.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.270
You can also see a connection here between

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.100
the ArpaNet and MPLnet. Of course, the ArpaNet

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.920
wasn't the only network. There were other networks

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.040
at the time. Sat Net operated over satellite.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.160
There were packet radio networks and there were

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.470
also Ethernet local area network. Work started in

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.830
1973 on replacing the original network control protocol

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.570
with TCP/IP. Where IP was the Internetwork Protocol and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.380
TCP was the Transmission Control Protocol. TCP/IP

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.930
was ultimately standardized from 1978 to 1981

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.790
and included in Berkley UNIX in 1981. And on January 1st, 1983 the internet

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.920
had one of its flag days, where the arbanet transitioned to TCP IP. Now

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.790
the internet continued to grow, but the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.580
number of computers on the internet really didn't

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.320
start to take off until the mid 90s.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.370
You can see here that around August 1995 there

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.620
were about 10 million hosts on the internet,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.350
and five years later there was an order magnitude

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.702
of hosts on the internet. More than 100

00:02:21.702 --> 00:02:25.470
million. During this period the Internet experienced a number

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.780
of technical milestones. In 1982. The internet saw

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.730
the rollout of the domain name system which replaced

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.880
the host.txt file containing all the world's

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.980
machine names with a distributed name lookup system.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.140
1988 saw the rollout of TCP congestion

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.390
control after the net suffered a series of

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.510
congestion collapses. 1989 saw the NSF net

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.860
and BGP inter-domain routing. Including support for routing

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.270
policy. The 90s, on the other hand,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.720
saw a lot of new applications. In approximately

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.600
1992, we started to see a lot of streaming media, including audio and video. The

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.440
Web was not soon after, in 1993, which allowed users to browse a mesh of

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.990
hyperlinks. The first major search engine was Altavista, which came online

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.290
in December of 1995, and peer to peer protocols and applications

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.389
including file sharing, began to emerge around 2000.
