00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.417
So I'm starting with the code we had before that works correctly, except for,

00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:06.814
with this assumption that all months have 30 days. So the first step is going to

00:00:06.814 --> 00:00:10.335
be to define the stub procedure daysInMonth that gives the number of days in a

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:14.272
month. But, for our stub procedure, we're just going to always return 30. And

00:00:14.272 --> 00:00:18.631
I'm going to modify nextDay to call daysInMonth. That's pretty simple, but I

00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:21.628
should start testing, and I'm going to write some code to do testing. We don't

00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:24.879
want to have to keep typing the same test cases in the shell. We want to write

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:28.928
some code for testing. For the problem that's provided, there were some provided

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:32.403
test cases. I'm going to write my own starting now. And I'm going to make sure

00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:35.941
that these test cases, we don't expect the correct results yet because I'm

00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:39.665
testing with 30-day months. So, I'm going to test two dates that are the same.

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:43.560
It's a boundary case, it's a useful one to test. I'm going to test from one day

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.409
to the next, that should give us one day. And these are test cases for daysBetweendates.

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.210
I should really be writing some test cases for nextDay. The

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.060
reason for that is that, if they fail, well, it's going to be more easy to

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.260
understand what went wrong, rather than just writing all of my test cases for

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.486
daysBetweenDays. So let's try some nextDay test cases. Got one where the day

00:01:02.486 --> 00:01:08.262
advances. Let's get one where the month advances. And I will use a month that

00:01:08.262 --> 00:01:14.082
has 30 days. So it will be correct in 30 months, but will still be correct once

00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:18.068
we fix this. And I'll use advancing the year. A few test cases, probably we

00:01:18.068 --> 00:01:23.198
should have more. But let's try that. We should save, and let's run this, and

00:01:23.198 --> 00:01:28.090
we'll run our test. And, something failed. Not too surprising, this happens.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.740
Let's see what failed. And the failure is type error that I'm calling

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.380
daysInMonth Not passing in the right number of parameters. In fact, I passed in

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.326
0. I should have passed in both the year and the month. So this is one of the

00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:44.050
reasons for writing things in stubs, we can find these kinds of errors quickly.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.239
So let's try again, and now we're test passed, and our test case is using

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.716
restrictions. I'm going to be a little more careful and print something out when

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:56.864
the test finishes, because it's a little bit dangerous to have nothing to tell

00:01:56.864 --> 00:02:00.909
when the test finished. Maybe we didn't get any output for some other reason.
