00:00:00.212 --> 00:00:04.270
Ember CLI is recommended by the ember
team as the de facto way of building and

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.130
developing a new amber application.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.410
It's incredibly powerful, and

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.460
we'll be using it to generate our
ember app, create new template, and

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.230
component files, and
maintain and update new routes.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.660
You can do a lot more than
just these tasks though.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.498
So let's see what it can do.

00:00:16.498 --> 00:00:20.030
Running ember --help gives us a list
of subcommands with their own set

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.170
of options.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.440
There's a lot to scroll through but

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.580
we can do just one comment at
a time by using the help flag.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.520
And passing the name of the sub command.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.910
I'm going to clear the screen so
that there's not all this clutter.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.390
Then to see just the new command.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.895
Run ember -- help new.

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:36.800
Ember new is the command we
will use to create a new app.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.710
Notice that running this command
will create a new directory.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.280
I like to keep stuff I work
on in a project's directory.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.610
So when i use ember to
create a new project,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.390
it'll create the app's folder in here.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.800
Let's create our app.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.550
A name is required, so
let's give it the name UdaciMeals.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.220
This command does a number of things.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.880
It creates an Ember app's
default file structure.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.600
Creates an initial commit.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.070
Runs npm install.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.890
And runs bower install.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.480
Installing the dependencies can
take quite a while, so I'm just

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.430
going to pause for a second until
it's finished installing everything.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.650
And it's finished.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.040
Let me clear the screen again.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.910
Another thing that Ember CLI
includes is a built-in server.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.820
We don't have to worry about
installing a server or

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.350
dealing with some third party code.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.900
This is really awesome.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.100
But the server needs to run
inside of our project, so

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.850
we need to move in there.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.370
Running Ember serve
will start the server.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.615
We can view our app at localhost:4200.

00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:32.830
Switching to the browser shows us our
Ember app with some starter content.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.700
An entire development server in just
one command, isn't that awesome?

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.420
Ember CLI is an amazing tool
that's always in development,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.540
sometimes a bug will pop
up from time to time.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.180
While recording this video
I ran into a bug myself.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.280
There's a story about it
in the instructor notes.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.950
If you have any problems with Ember CLI
check out the project's issues on GitHub

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.730
to see if a fix is already in the works.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.880
Or check the forums to see
if what you're running

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.860
into has already been solved.
