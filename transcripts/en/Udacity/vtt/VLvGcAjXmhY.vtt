So, I wrote this program that sends out text messages and here is the phone

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.810
where I want to receive my text message. So, let me just go ahead and run my

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:16.140
code. In three, two, one.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.020
Oh, seems like I have a new message, I wonder who that is

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.810
from. The message says, my name is Ron Burgundy, cool. Let's build this program.
