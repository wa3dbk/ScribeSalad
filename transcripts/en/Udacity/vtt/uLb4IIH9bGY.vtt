I already have a tester. So I'll just start filling in the implementation. I

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:09.680
want to go through the longPost, each letter of it. And copy the consonants

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.264
into another shorter post. So I'll start out with a string shortPost. And I'll

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:18.627
go one letter at a time. I can't use the increment to skip the vowels. Because

00:00:18.627 --> 00:00:22.976
I don't know which ones are vowels until I check. Inside the loop, I'll need to

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:26.909
check if the ith letter is a vowel or not, and if it's not, I'll add it to

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.553
shortPost. We've written conditions to look for things that are not vowels

00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:36.726
before. This is a different way of doing it. Instead of using if it's a or e or

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:40.884
i, I made a string that contains all vowels, and then I asked that string If it

00:00:40.884 --> 00:00:48.828
contains the letter I'm looking at. If this string contains the letter I'm

00:00:48.828 --> 00:00:55.580
looking at, the letter's a vowel. So, if it does not contain the letter I'm

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.740
looking for, then it's a consonant. In which case, I'll add it to short post.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.548
There's one more important thing that I need to do. I need to actually return

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:09.926
the string. Let's see if it works. Here's our actual, and it's exactly like the

00:01:09.926 --> 00:01:10.943
expected.
