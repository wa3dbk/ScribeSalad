00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.716
To give you an idea of how common this interface is, strings are already

00:00:04.716 --> 00:00:10.700
comparable. You can check whether a class implements comparable by looking at

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.091
its documentation. Under all implemented interfaces, you can see that

00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:21.687
comparable is listed. Just to get you thinking, what will this method called

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:27.372
return Badminton.compareTo Football. Will it return minus 4, 4, 0, true, or

00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:32.048
false? Think about the natural order of strings. And if you're not sure you can

00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:36.057
try it in bluejay. I haven't totally explained to you how to do this question,

00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:38.474
but just go with your gut.
