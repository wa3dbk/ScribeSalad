00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.343
We had three groups. Snapzi, Irisa, and LolaMoon. So there are 2 degrees of

00:00:05.343 --> 00:00:11.172
freedom for the between groups variability. For the within groups, we had four

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:17.272
values in each group. And we subtract one for each group. That makes 9 degrees

00:00:17.272 --> 00:00:23.713
of freedom. Remember that this is the same as the total number, capital N which

00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:31.250
is 12 minus k, the number of groups, which is 3. 12 minus 3 is 9.
