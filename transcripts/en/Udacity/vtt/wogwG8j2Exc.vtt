To place the use of components into context.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.300
I want to describe a typical situation that often arises during

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.180
industrial software development.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.810
The decision has to do with acquiring software assets.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.500
Should you construct them yourself?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.160
Or buy them from somewhere else?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.170
This is sometimes called the buy versus build decision.
