00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.390
Here are some things that a data scientist may do

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.320
in his or her daily work. They might wrangle data. That

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.480
is, collect data from the real world, process it, and

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.010
create a data set that can be analyzed. Once they have

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.650
a data set, they may analyze trends in the existing

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.960
data or try to make data driven predictions about the future

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.610
using the data at hand. Based on this models or predictions,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.190
they cannot only build data driven products but also communicate their

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.950
findings to those other data scientists and the general

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.720
public. File visualizations, reports or blog posts. But hey,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.720
this is my point of view. Why don't we

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.370
talk to some other data scientists and hear their thoughts.
