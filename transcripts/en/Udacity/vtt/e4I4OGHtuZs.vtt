Let's do an exercise together. Here is a sentence. John took the book from Mary.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.570
For this sentence, first write down the primitive action that

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.800
best captures the meaning of the sentence. And then write down the fillers for

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.780
each of the slots of this primitive action.
