00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.836
If Grant invests $10,000 at a 3% annual rate compounded twice a year, then in 6

00:00:05.836 --> 00:00:13.470
months, he'll receive 1.5% on this $10,000 investment. This means that $150.00

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.700
will be added to his account, in interest. The total balance will then be

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.737
10,000 plus 150, or $10,150. After six more months pass, Grant will again

00:00:26.737 --> 00:00:35.272
receive 1.5% interest, but now on this new amount. The interest added this time

00:00:35.272 --> 00:00:44.696
will be 0.015 times 10,150, or $152.25. This will make the total amount of

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:52.222
money in the account after one year equal to $10,302.25. Note that in the

00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:55.732
second six months, more interest is added, since Grant is getting interest on

00:00:55.732 --> 00:00:58.810
the interest from the previous six months, as well as on his original

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.550
investment. Seems like a pretty good deal to me.
