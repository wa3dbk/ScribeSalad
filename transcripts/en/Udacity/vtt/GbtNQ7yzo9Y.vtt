00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.280
The Diagonalization argument comes up in
many contexts, and is very useful for

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.990
generating paradoxes and
mathematical contradictions.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.020
To show how general the technique is,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.440
let's examine it in the context
of English adjectives.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.330
Here, I've created a table with English
adjectives both as the rows and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.920
as the columns.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.400
Consider the row to be the word itself,
and

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.130
the column to be the string
representation of the word.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.250
For each entry,
I've written a 1 if the row adjective

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.560
applies to the column
representation of the word.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.700
For instance, long is not a long word,
so I've written a 0.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.620
Polysyllabic is a long word,
so I've written a 1.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.670
French is not a French word,
it's an English word so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.400
I've written a 0, and so forth.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.870
So far we haven't run into any problems.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.590
Now let's make the following definition,
a heterological word

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.270
is a word that expresses a property that
its representation does not possess.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.520
We can add the representation of the
word to the table without any problems.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.540
It is a long, polysyllabic,
non-French word.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.200
But when we try to add the meaning
to the table, we run into problems.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.710
Remember, a heterological word
is one that expresses a property

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.470
that its representation
does not possess.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.960
Long is not a long word,
so it is heterological.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.100
Polysyllabic is a polysyllabic word,
so it is not heterological.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.420
French is not a French word,
so it is heterological.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.020
In effect, we've taken the values
along this diagonal and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.620
flipped them to create this row.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.970
What about heterological, however?

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.390
If we say that this heterological,
causing us to put a 1 here,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.250
then it applies to itself, so
it can't be heterological.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.590
On the other hand, if we say that it is
not heterological, causing us to put a 0

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.490
here, then it doesn't apply to
itself and it is heterological.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.440
So there really is no
satisfactory answer here.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.210
Heterological is not well
defined as an adjective.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.770
For English adjectives, we tend
simply to ignore the paradox, and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.620
politely say that we can't
answer that question.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.940
Even in mathematics, the polite response
was simply to ignore such questions

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.160
until around the turn
of the 20th century.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.700
When philosophers began to look for
more solid logical foundations for

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.550
reasoning, and for
mathematics in particular.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.260
Naively, one might think that a set
could be an arbitrary collection.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.020
But what about the set of all sets
that do not contain themselves?

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.980
Is this set a member of itself or not?

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.710
This paradox posed by Bertrand Russell,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.910
wasn't satisfactorily resolved until
the 1920s with the formulation

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.990
of what we now call Zermelo-Fraenkel
set theory or from mathematical logic.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.360
Consider the statement,
This statement is false.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.040
If this statement is true,
then it says that it's false, and

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.640
if the statement is false,
then it says so and should be true.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.970
It turns out that falsehood,
in this sense,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.300
isn't well-defined mathematically.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.582
At this point, you've probably guessed
where this is going for this course.

00:03:09.582 --> 00:03:12.730
We're going to apply the diagnalization
trick to turning machines.
