00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.662
Okay, so a quick quiz just to test a little understanding

00:00:02.662 --> 00:00:05.184
about number of steps and total amount of work.

00:00:05.184 --> 00:00:07.328
We have a more complicated tree right here,

00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:10.891
and so you can think of every circle here as 1 operation.

00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:14.163
Some operations take 2 inputs, some operations take 1.

00:00:14.163 --> 00:00:20.330
So what are the total number of steps in going from the inputs up here to the output down here?

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.999
And what is the total amount of work measured in number of operations

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.149
to get from the 8 inputs up here to the 1 output down here?
