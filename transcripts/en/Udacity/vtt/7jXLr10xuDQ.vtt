Thank you very much for your answer. Proof of the pudding is in the eating.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So what we do is we simply press run and we press run again and we see--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we get an assertion error and indeed it is the post condition of square root that has failed.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So the correct answer is the reduction square root post condition fails.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So we saw that the post condition of square root mainly squaring the square root

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
equals the origin of value failed.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This is weird because all we use--we invoke the standard square root function of Python.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Does this mean that Python square root function is wrong and now finally,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
through systematic random testing, we found the bug.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Let me show you what's actually going on in here.
