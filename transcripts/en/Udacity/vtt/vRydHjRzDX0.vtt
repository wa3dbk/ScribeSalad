00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.948
The process of finding the right
investor is not an easy one.

00:00:03.948 --> 00:00:07.658
I think it really begins in
understanding who are the investors that

00:00:07.658 --> 00:00:10.340
are going to be
attracted to what you do.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.720
So, for example, you can go out and
find investors that like your domain.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.186
They have invested in companies in your
space, not in a competitor of yours,

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.742
but in your type of technology or
business.

00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:24.185
And perhaps,
they would have the propensity and

00:00:24.185 --> 00:00:25.740
the interest to invest in you.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.125
So, making out that list,
you can search on Angie's List and

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:34.570
CrunchBase and other free data sources
out there to find those investors.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.570
That would be number one.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.094
Number two is,
I think people that perhaps you've come,

00:00:39.094 --> 00:00:41.210
throughout your career,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.110
perhaps working in an early stage
startup and you were an early employee.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.110
And maybe there's an investor
that invested in that company.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.160
Maybe those are investors that
invested in your friends, right?

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.560
People that actually can look at you and

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.260
know that what you've done before this
startup is something quite amazing.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.099
And they might want to invest in you
going forward, because of who you are,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.340
because they believe in you.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.710
So, looking at investors in your domain,
looking at investors that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.410
share the same career path with you, or
invested in startups you work with, and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.050
then reaching out to investors
that maybe your friends know,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.990
that invested in their businesses,
that your friends can vouch for

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.270
you when they make the introduction
to those investors.
