00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.710
Phew, some of that was pretty technical, but if you

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.215
followed along, you now have a solid understanding of the

00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:09.280
semantics of threaded programming. You are now familiar with the

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.370
notions of joinable and detached threads, locks, synchronization, and many

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.410
of the details of the p threads library. Of course,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.100
you will learn much more if you get involved in

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.230
developing an application that uses threaded programming, but now at

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.130
least you have a good foundation to start from. Happy programming.
