00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.969
They'll vary integrate,
when we want to share code between

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.720
different versions of what
are essentially the same app.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.189
However, if we want to
build a collection of apps,

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.970
with similar capabilities,
we may instead,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.660
want to break up some of our
functionality often to a library.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.970
We may even simply have a collection of
utilities that we want to share across

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.730
projects, similar to
the Google lava Library.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.590
There are two choices when creating
libraries for use with Android projects.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.310
We can create a straight Java
project that build a .jar file, or

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.570
we can build an Android library
that creates an .aar file.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.600
The primary difference between
the two is that an .aar or

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.380
Android archive can include
its own resources and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.530
manifests, such as layouts or
fragments, and it uses its own R file.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.890
The benefit of creating a Java library
is it can be used on non-Android

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.980
projects.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.870
It's up to you to determine if a library
should be Android-specific or not.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.090
Just keep in mind that there
are maybe future considerations, and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.940
that Java libraries
are easier to turn into

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.830
Android libraries than
the other way around.
