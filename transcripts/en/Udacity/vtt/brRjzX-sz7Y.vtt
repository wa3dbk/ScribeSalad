00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.910
Hello, and welcome to the third part

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.426
of our software engineering course. In this mini-course,

00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:09.250
we will discuss software design. We will

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.170
also introduce the Unified Software Process. And we

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.730
will work on a more complex project,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.330
in which we will develop a distributed software

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.960
system that involves multiple different platforms. In

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.730
our first lesson of this mini-course, in particular,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.150
we will talk about software architecture. A

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.650
software engineering discipline whose goal is to lay

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.980
the foundation on which to build successful

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.130
and long lasting software systems. So let's begin.
