00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here is my solution. Test is a function of the data l and the hypothesis h.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We first compute the mean and then the plus/minus term of the confidence intervals,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and if our actual hypothesis differs from the mean by less than the confidence interval size,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we return true, and that is a two-sided test,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
hence the absolute involving the difference between h and m.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If we look at this, this logical expression at the bottom will only trigger,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
if h deviates way too much more than c from m, and so it goes.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Down here is the output of our example from class. 201.5 was the mean.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
1.366 was the size of the interval, and we got a false.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We don't believe h zero.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If I change my hypothesis to 201 and one will test again, we now get a true as a result of this test.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Great. You programmed confidence intervals and you programmed a hypothesis test.

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That is actually really cool. If you programmed it, I bet you now really know how it works.
