00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.290
The structure of this course will likely
change a bit from semester to semester.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.170
After all, we hope to learn and
improve the course over time.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.415
But there's an overarching structure
that we anticipate staying fairly

00:00:09.415 --> 00:00:10.710
consistent.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.050
You'll start the course by really
getting into an intense phase of study

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.120
in the field that you're most interested
in within educational technology.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.780
You'll answer some reflective questions.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.700
You'll go out and
find your own resources.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.050
And you'll really develop
a mastery of that topic.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.562
At the end of that stage, you'll be
asked to demonstrate that mastery with

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:28.920
a custom question written just for
you to answer.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.120
To demonstrate that you can
really think in this field,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.420
you can contribute to this community.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.300
Then it's time to propose your project.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.430
You'll work with your mentor
to scope out your plan for

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.170
the rest of the semester and decide how
you're going to bring your idea to life.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.270
At this point, you might also
decide to work in a group and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.850
tackle a big problem as a team, instead
of small problems as individuals.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.240
Then it's time to work
on your project and

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.990
you'll spend the rest of
the semester working on it and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.710
delivering weekly reports
on how you're progressing.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.080
You'll talk to your mentor a lot during
this phase to get their constant

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.520
feedback and evaluate how
the project is coming together.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.220
And then at the end of the semester,
you'll deliver the project, a paper and

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.870
a presentation.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.800
So that you can share your ideas,
both with your classmates and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.290
potentially, with the broader
field of educational technology.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.830
The goal is that your
project won't end there.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.850
We hope that this is just
a jumping off point for

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.730
something that you'll continue
to work on going forward.
