00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.694
Here are our two answers. Great work if you found even one of those. For the

00:00:04.694 --> 00:00:09.758
first one, we want to list all the factors of our radicand. We know 2 times 2

00:00:09.758 --> 00:00:14.573
times 3 equals 12. Then we have 3 x's multiplied together. And 2 y's multiplied

00:00:14.573 --> 00:00:19.240
together. We're taking the square root and the index is at 2 here. So we want

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.436
to find factors that repeat twice. We have two 2s, two x's and two y's, so we

00:00:24.436 --> 00:00:30.203
can pull one 2 out, one x out and one y out. This 3 and this x are factors that

00:00:30.203 --> 00:00:33.979
need to stay underneath the square root symbol, and it's because they are not

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:39.604
paired. This leaves us with our final answer, 2xy times the square root of 3x.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.576
For the second one, we want to find factors that repeat three times, since our

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:50.400
index is a 3. We have three 3's and three c's, so we can pull out one 3 and one

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.276
c from our radical. These factors don't appear in a triple, so we have to leave

00:00:55.276 --> 00:01:02.280
them inside of the cube root. We'll add 2a squared times c and our cube root.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.166
This gives us our final result. Keep in mind that this 3 is the index on the

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:11.126
root, it's not the exponent of the c. So be careful when you're writing your

00:01:11.126 --> 00:01:12.273
expressions.
