00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.342
Great work if you got 6 divided by 55. When we multiply fractions, we multiply

00:00:05.342 --> 00:00:09.060
the numerators straight across and the denominators straight across. And if you

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.840
recall all the way back to our first unit, we want to factor the numerators and

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.101
denominators first to simplify our math. We know 4 divided by 4 equals 1, and 3

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:22.680
divided by 3 also equals 1. Keep in mind I can only simplify one of these 3's,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.820
since one is the numerator and one is the denominator. This other 3 must stay in

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.978
the numerator since there isn't another 3 in the denominator to cancel it out or

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:37.484
simplify to 1. We're left with 2 times 3, which is 6, and 11 times 5 which is

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:37.840
55.
