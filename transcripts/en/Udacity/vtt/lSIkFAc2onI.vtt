00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.430
Want some examples? Almost anything done by

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.830
a magician. You know, magicians are masters

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.310
at maniuplating your attention, providing misleading signifiers,

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.930
and misleading affordances. Secret doors. For example, hidden

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.050
behind a book case that swings to the side when one of the books

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.170
is pulled. Another one, many homes or

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.350
business display fake video cameras and security warnings.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.260
They're trying to scare away criminals but without the expense

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.100
of putting in a real camera or hiring a real

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.510
security company. And I own a fake watch. Now, that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.100
is, it's a real watch. It tells good time. But it

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.780
has extra buttons and dials that make it look like

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.280
an expensive chronometer. The buttons don't even move, and the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.870
dials, well, they're just printed pictures of dials. It was

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.490
given to me as a present, and it certainly fooled me.
