Thanks, Chris, for that question. This one's a little bit more difficult. If you

00:00:04.348 --> 00:00:08.382
got 160, you got it right. Even though this is an absolute value problem, we

00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:12.527
also have to follow the order of operations. The absolute value symbols act as

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.531
parentheses as well. We know when we're working with parentheses, we need to

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:19.343
work from the inner most parentheses outward.

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:24.344
So, first thing we have to do is evaluate what is inside these parenthesis and

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:29.262
follow the order of operations, and then we'll move on. The first thing I want

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:34.579
to do is evaluate this 6 squared. 6 squared is 36, so this turns into 6 minus

00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:39.759
36. First we want to evaluate 6 squared. 6 squared is 36, so here we have 6

00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:44.841
minus 36. We still have another operation inside the parenthesis before we can

00:00:44.853 --> 00:00:49.638
move the operations outside the parenthesis. So here I have to evaluate 6 minus

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.284
36. 6 minus 36 is negative 30. Now that I finish evaluating what's inside the

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:59.193
parenthesis, I can move towards the absolute value symbols. When I'm working

00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:03.719
inside the absolute value symbols, I still have to follow the order of

00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:08.921
operations. So I have an exponent. Let's evaluate that first. I have 2 times the

00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:12.473
absolute value of negative 5 squared. Now, we have to evaluate negative 5

00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:17.710
squared. Since the negative is not in parentheses, negative is not part of the

00:01:17.722 --> 00:01:22.048
base, so we have negative 1 times 5 squared. And we know that 5 squared is 25.

00:01:22.222 --> 00:01:27.076
And I copy down the rest of the operations. I know when I write two numbers next

00:01:27.088 --> 00:01:31.528
to each other that I have to multiply them. So the next thing I need to do

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.338
inside my absolute value is to evaluate the two multiplications in order from

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.709
left to right. So I have 2 times the absolute value Of negative 1 times 25,

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:46.320
which is negative 25. Negative 25 times negative 2 is positive 50. Then I have

00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:52.670
negative 1 times negative 30, which gives me positive 30. So I have 2 times the

00:01:52.682 --> 00:01:58.576
absolute value of -1 times 25. Which is negative 25 times negative 2 is positive

00:01:58.588 --> 00:02:02.747
50 and then I have negative 1 times negative 30, gives me a positive 30. Now

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.109
that I've perform ed the multiplication and division inside the absolute value,

00:02:07.207 --> 00:02:11.463
I can do the addition and subtraction. So I have 2 times the absolute value of

00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:17.084
50 plus 30, which is 80. Since absolute value is the distance a number is from

00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:23.027
zero, we know that the absolute value of 80 is simply 80. So, the last step is 2

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.104
times 80, and 2 times 80 gives us our answer of 160.
