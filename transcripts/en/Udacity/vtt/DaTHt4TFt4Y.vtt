&gt;&gt; Once again, David, is using his background knowledge.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.570
In his background knowledge he says that the bricks are like the cylinders.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.240
The vertical bricks are like the vertical cylinders. So, what holds for

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.210
the vertical bricks, they must not be touching, also holds for

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.050
the vertical cylinders. They too must not be touching. Again, someone else may

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.840
have a different background knowledge and may come up with a different answer.
