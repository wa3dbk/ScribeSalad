00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.580
In the earlier description of data structures, we mentioned two terms that we

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.140
have not yet talked about, interrupts and signals.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.170
Let's take a moment now to explain these concepts in a little more detail.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.920
Interrupts are events that are generated externally to a CPU

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.582
by components that are other than the CPU where the interrupt is delivered.

00:00:21.582 --> 00:00:23.190
Interrupts represent, basically,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.640
some type of notification to the CPU that some external event has occurred.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.890
This can be from I/O devices like a network device delivering an interrupt that

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.760
a network packet arrived or

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.880
from timers notifying the CPU that a timeout has occurred or from other CPUs.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.270
Which particular interrupts can occur on a given platform depends on

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.280
the specific configuration of the platform,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.550
like the types of devices that it has, for instance.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.940
Or the details about the hardware architecture and similar features.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.920
Another important characteristic about interrupts is they appear asynchronously.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.570
That's to say that they're not in the direct response to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.540
some specific action that's taking place on the CPU.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.830
Signals, on the other hand, are events that are triggered basically by

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.790
the software that's running on the CPU.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.490
They're either for

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.010
real generated by software, sort of like software interrupt, or the CPU hardware

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.660
itself triggers certain events that are basically interpreted as signals.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.360
Which signals can occur on a given platform depends very much on

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.040
the operating system.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.490
So two identical platforms will have the same interrupts, but if

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.010
they're running a different operating system they will have different signals.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.448
Unlike hardware interrupts,

00:01:42.448 --> 00:01:45.970
signals can appear both synchronously and asynchronously.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.200
By synchronous here we mean that they occur in response to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.110
a specific action that took place on the CPU, and

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.140
in response to that action, a synchronous signal is generated.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.220
For instance if a process is trying to touch memory that has

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.140
not been allocated to it, then this will result in a synchronous signal.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.740
There's some aspects of interrupts and signals that are similar.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.660
Both interrupts and signals have a unique identifier.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.410
And its value will depend either on the hardware in the case of interrupts.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.690
Or on the operating system in the case of signals.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.070
Both interrupts and signals can be masked.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.600
For this, we use either a per CPU mask for the interrupt.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.410
Or a per process mask for the signals to disable or

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.040
to suspend the notification that an interrupt or a signal is delivering.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.510
The interrupt mask is associated with a CPU because interrupts are delivered to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.630
the CPU as a whole.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.090
Whereas the signal mask is associated with a process,

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.100
because signals are delivered to individual processes.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.700
If the mask indicates that the signal, or the interrupt,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.490
is enabled, then that will result in invoking the corresponding handler.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.110
The interrupt handlers are specified for

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.580
the entire system by the operating system.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.160
For the signal handlers however, the operating system allows processes to

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.330
specify their per process handling operations
