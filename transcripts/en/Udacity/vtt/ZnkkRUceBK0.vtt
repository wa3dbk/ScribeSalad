00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.255
I know if I multiply 1 by 2 and then add 1, I would get 3. Let's see if this

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:12.857
same rule applies in the other cases. I can take my input of 2, multiply it by

00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:19.263
2, and then add 1 to get 5. The same rule works for 3. 3 times 2 is 6, plus 1 is

00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:27.534
7. So, for any input of x, I just multiply it by 2 and then add 1. That's my

00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:29.189
rule.
