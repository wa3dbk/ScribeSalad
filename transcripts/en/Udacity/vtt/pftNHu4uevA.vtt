00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.342
However, we're not just concerned with how far values are from the mean, we're

00:00:05.342 --> 00:00:10.637
also concerned with whether or not they're below the mean or above the mean.

00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:15.891
When you standardize any score on the x-axis, we get the z score. We already

00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:20.732
called it z before. And we're always going to subtract the mean from the x

00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:26.073
value, and then divide by the standard deviation. So that way if we have a value

00:00:26.073 --> 00:00:30.949
less than the mean, we're going to get a negative z score. The z score is

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.946
basically the number of standard deviations any value is away from the mean.

00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:41.052
Therefore, we can convert any value in a normal distribution to a z score. When

00:00:41.052 --> 00:00:45.789
we do this, we standardize the distribution. We can start with any normal

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.054
distribution, and then standardize it. So let's again, refer back to our normal

00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:56.635
distribution. The mean is 190, this is the actual mean of Facebook friends I've

00:00:56.635 --> 00:01:01.819
looked at up, but let's pretend that this standard deviation is 36 like it was

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:06.951
in our example were Andy and I were arguing our unpopularity. So using this

00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:12.216
information click the link that we share and tell us how many Facebook friends

00:01:12.216 --> 00:01:17.305
you have And then calculate your z score. Later we're going to, to analyze that

00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:22.311
data and see if we get a normal distribution. So we'll be able to tell if some z

00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:27.088
score values don't match up. Do your best when you calculate your z score

00:01:27.088 --> 00:01:31.846
because it's good practice, and we're going to use z scores the rest of the

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:37.079
class. If you don't have Facebook just enter 0, but be careful. This does not

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.058
mean that your z score is going to be 0. You'll have to calculate that and

00:01:42.058 --> 00:01:47.475
figure out what it is. And I will know if you didn't calculate it correctly.
