So, the one way you could have done this is started out by subtracting 18 from

00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:07.662
both sides. That would have left you with negative x equals negative 6. And then

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:11.398
if you did the problem this way, what was the next step that you took in order

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.106
to get x by itself? Please tape what you did to each side or what you would do

00:00:15.118 --> 00:00:16.949
to each side in these boxes right here.
