00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.968
Now, let's look at that other half of the graph, the part of the graph that's to

00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:07.990
the left of this line of symmetry, the axis of the problem. In this interval,

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.020
which goes from negative infinity to negative 0.75, not including either

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.172
endpoint. What can you say about the behavior of f of x? Again, we're going to

00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:20.560
read the graph from left to right. So, I'm asking you, as x values increase,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.560
what happens to the value of f of x? Does it increase, does it decrease or does

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.479
it stay constant?
