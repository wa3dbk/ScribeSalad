00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.440
This lesson will explain what happens
when we execute more than one thread or

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.040
process at the same time.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.780
This used to be what happens
only in super computers and

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.560
high-end servers, but now and
in the future, almost every computer

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.590
will have more than one core and
possibly more than one thread per core.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.800
So it can be said that all processing
today really is multiprocessing.
