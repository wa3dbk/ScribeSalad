00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.910
One of the best known tools for
batch processing raster and

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.300
vector images is ImageMagick.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.157
ImageMagick is a free and open source
tool that enables you to automate

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:17.197
just about anything you might normally
do with a GUI based image editor.

00:00:17.197 --> 00:00:23.670
Such as converting formats or
cropping or applying filters.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.990
Now for responsive images, this means
you can automate the process of

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.750
creating multiple versions of the same
image with different sizes or formats.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.810
In this example I'm using the
ImageMagick convert command to create

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.660
a webp goanna.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.920
Let's open those in Chrome.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.980
Identical.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.189
Cool thing is, the webp goanna is
about 10% smaller than the jpg.

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:50.400
That could make quite a difference
on a flaky connection.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.930
In this example, I've written a shell
script that uses ImageMagick to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.290
create small and large versions of
my original photographic images,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.630
saving in webp and JPEG formats.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.830
Note that massive
reduction in file sizes.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.710
There's my originally goanna.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.280
And these are the versions
that I created.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.400
You can incorporate ImageMagick in
your build process via a Grunt task.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.080
In this example,
I'm using Grunt responsive images

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.860
to automate production of images,
just like I did with the shell script.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.814
And then you can see the output.

00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:28.157
I've got a bunch of images
saved at 50% width and

00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:33.420
30% width in JPEG format
at different quality sizes.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.080
There are a couple of really useful
apps that combine other tools for

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.585
image optimization.

00:01:40.585 --> 00:01:45.214
For example, ImageOptim enables
lossless image optimization using

00:01:45.214 --> 00:01:47.480
a number of open source tools.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.150
Pngout, pngcrush,
jpegoptim Giftical and so on.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.160
Now look at the file sizes of
our images before and after.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.360
ImageAlpha uses pngquant and
other tools for compression.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.369
ImageAlpha can reduce 24-bit PNG files
by applying lossy compression and

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.139
converting to PNG-8 plus alpha format.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.590
Look at our PNG sizes before and after.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.417
But looking at that, it went down from
about 330 kilobytes to around about 118.

00:02:20.417 --> 00:02:22.270
That's like, around half the size.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.960
As well as the GUI
versions you've just seen,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.730
tools like ImageOptim and ImageAlpha
can also be run from the command line.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.500
And incorporated with
your build process.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.580
In this example I'm running
ImageOptum as a Grunt task.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.268
That means you can incorporate automated
image optimization in your work flow.

00:02:43.268 --> 00:02:46.380

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.720
