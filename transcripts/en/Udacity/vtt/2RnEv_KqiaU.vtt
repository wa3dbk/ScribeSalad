00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.969
The minimum possible maximum depth is 1.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.973
So if we start with a node here that we're going to number 0,

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:09.347
and then we're going to have a graph where every

00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:13.097
single node is attached to that root node,

00:00:13.097 --> 00:00:15.738
well the depth of each one of these is going to be 1.

00:00:15.738 --> 00:00:20.005
On the other hand, the maximum possible max depth is going to be N minus 1.

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:21.951
So what's our graph look like there?

00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:24.053
We're going to start with the root node and then we're going to have

00:00:24.053 --> 00:00:28.813
a linear chain of graph nodes all the way out to N minus 1.

00:00:28.813 --> 00:00:30.856
Now it's important for you to realize these are

00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:33.802
2 very different graphs from the point of view of parallelization.

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:38.341
This linear chain here--very hard to parallelize if we're doing a BFS.

00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:43.502
It's going to take us order of n steps to get from the start node all the way to the end node.

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:45.852
Not going to get a lot of parallelization out of that.

00:00:45.852 --> 00:00:50.519
And clever students are going to realize, this is the worst case step complexity of the BFS.

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.654
But if we have a graph that looks like this, a star shaped graph,

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:56.773
then parallelization is a lot more straightforward.

00:00:56.773 --> 00:01:00.109
We can process each one of those leaves independently, in parallel.
