00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.151
Here's a chance for you to try out how
this works using a slightly bigger

00:00:04.163 --> 00:00:08.992
polynomial. So we have a polynomial of two
terms, as our first factor, multiplied by a

00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:13.744
polynomial of three terms, as our second
factor. So remember start with the 3x over

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:18.521
here and multiply it by each of the three
terms in the second set of parentheses, and

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:22.783
then, distribute the 1 to each of these. So
all we're really doing is using the

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:26.893
distributor property first, only looking
at the 3x and then second, only looking at

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:30.679
the 1. So, give it a try. If this is
difficult that makes perfect sense, this

00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:34.549
is a really tricky concept to grasp. We
will give you plenty of practice to make

00:00:34.324 --> 00:00:36.190
sure that you understand it.
