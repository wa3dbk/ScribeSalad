00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Until now, we've been working with this kind of standard picture

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of this little guy and his browser.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, this used to be you,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but now this is the user.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You have upgraded to the other side of the picture where the servers are.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So let's get these boxes. We've seen these 100 times.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Okay, and let's add you over here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You are now the programmer. Congratulations, you are a web developer.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We can talk about users and how much trouble they cause us.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, in a normal web request, the user makes a request to the servers,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and we respond with the response.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
No surprises there.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, what we're going to be talking about today is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
when your servers start making requests to other servers.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So this is our website. It runs on these boxes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's say we're going to hit somebody else--Twitter, for example.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They have their own servers.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Their servers are probably on fire, because it's Twitter.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So we can have a web page that actually makes requests to Twitter.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
These are our computers talking to their computers.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This happens all the time.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
They're still communicating over HTTP,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and Twitter still responds as usual,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but if we're writing some web program that, for example,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
does some data analysis on Twitter,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
the user might make a request to us.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We might make a request to Twitter servers,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
they respond with what their response would be normally,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and then we may manipulate that data and return it to the user.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And this is actually a really common case.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What I'd like to do now is actually explain

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
how Hipmunk works a little bit,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
because we do a lot of this type of communication.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Okay, let's change our picture a little bit to be a little bit more about Hipmunk,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
because I'd like to explain how our architecture works.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So in this case, this is still--

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
we call users customers when they're actually paying--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and this is me--Steve--and this is Hipmunk servers.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
When a user does a flight search, what we do is

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
we hit a bunch of our data providers

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
where we actually get our flight data from.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So the first thing we'll do is we'll take your flight search

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and we'll send it to ITA,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
we'll send it to an airline,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and in some cases we'll even send it to Amtrak,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
if that's appropriate.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Each of these guys are their own--

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
these are companies who have their own services that we work with.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So ITA will run our flight search, and they will send us data back.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The Airline, too, will run their own flight search on their own system

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and they'll send it back to us.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And Amtrak will do its thing and send their data back to us.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So then on our server, we have all this flight search data,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
represented by this blob here.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We will manipulate all this data, collate it, make you nice results,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and then we'll send back our HTML response.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So what we're going to be working on in this unit

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
is how do we make our server speak to other servers

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
when there's no browser involved.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We're still using HTTP,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
but we are now communicating over other protocols.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We saw some of this in Unit 1,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
but we're going to be doing a lot of it in this lesson,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
because there's a lot of cool things you can do when you realize

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that you're not the only service on the internet.
