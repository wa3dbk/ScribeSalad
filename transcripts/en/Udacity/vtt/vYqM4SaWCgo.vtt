00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.643
We know a positive 3 should go here, since 3 times 3x is equal to 9x. Remember,

00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:11.403
to find this number we can also divide 9x, this first term, by the first term of

00:00:11.403 --> 00:00:17.079
our divisor, 3x, 9x divided by 3x is positive 3. 3 Times 3x is positive 9x, and

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:22.518
3 times negative 2 is negative 6. Now we subtract the 9 x and the negative 6,

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:28.371
which changes both of the signs. This leaves us with 0 as the remainder. So 4x

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:34.451
plus 3 is the quotient, our answer, when we divide this polynomial by 3x minus

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:34.706
2.
