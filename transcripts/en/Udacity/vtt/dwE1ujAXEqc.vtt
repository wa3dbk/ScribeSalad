00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.600
The answer, too big: If P has more threads than a thread block is allowed to have,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.910
then we can't use shared memory to share data among all P threads,

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.504
because we have to distribute that tile across multiple thread blocks.

00:00:11.504 --> 00:00:15.534
Another consideration is making sure that we have at least as many thread blocks as SMs

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:18.213
or else SMs will sit idle.
