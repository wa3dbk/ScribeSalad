00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let’s say we have a list of numbers, and we wanted to find the odd numbers in that list.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One way to do this is to use list comprehensions as we've learned earlier in the class.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Here, the list of odds is only going to be the values of n,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
where n is an element in numbers and that n is odd, which is what this statement results in.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We can also use the same construction to turn this list of numbers

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
into a list of squares of each number.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
These types of operations are so common. In computer science, we give them a name.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This is usually referred to as a filter, and there's a map.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
When we're filtering, we take in a list of numbers and some criteria

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and only return the numbers that satisfy that criteria.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In a mapping, we take a list of elements and some operation

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and we perform that operation on each element.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Python actually gives us built-in functions to do this.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Another way to write odds is to use the built-in function filter where we give in two arguments.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The first is a function that we've created anonymously

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
using the lambda notation that return true or false.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
True if the n is odd, and false if n is even.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The second parameter is the numbers, so filter is going to return all the numbers

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that when inputted into our first parameter, this function returns true.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Here's how we generate the squares using the map operation.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We pass in two parameters just like we did with filter where the first one is a function

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and the second one is a list, and map returns a new list that is the result of applying each element

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in numbers to the first parameter that we gave the function.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This problem asks us to create what is known as a higher order of function

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that is we're going to create a function that generates a function that saves us time from having

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to repeat this first part of the filter and the map every time we want to use the same operation.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Ideally, instead of writing filter of lambda n and mod 2 equals equal one.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We're just going to create an odd filter.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Here our filter maker creates a new function that takes in one parameter--numbers--

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and applies filter in the same way as we have up here because we've already passed in

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
to the filter maker the function the we wanted to use filter on.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
There are two ways you can solve this. The first, would be using the lambda notation.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And the second is using inline function defines. Here, we're creating a function using lambda.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
That's what lambda does. It's a function that creates a function that is a list comprehension

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
for every element in our list, which is the one parameter into our lambda function L.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We're going to leave it in the new function created by this list comprehension

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
if that element satisfies our function F.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
In this alternative solution, I am using a nested function declaration

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
where we're creating a function that takes in the list and returns the result of filter of the original function

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that we used to create our special filter f in the list that we just passed into this function.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So that's how we do this for filter. Let's do the same thing for mapping.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And just like before, we can solve this in two ways. First, we'll go over how to do a lambda.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And then we'll briefly go over how to do it with a function declaration.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Here I am creating a function that is just a list comprehension that returns the result of applying

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
each element in l to function f.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
In this alternative solution, we're defining a function yourmap that simply returns the result

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
in using Phyton's built-in map with parameters f

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and the list that is passed in with applying yourmap.

00:03:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And the last line is returning the mapping function we created.
