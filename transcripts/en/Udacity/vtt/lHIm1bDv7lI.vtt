00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.641
We could jokingly say 2 plus 2 equals 5, but this is not actually an equation.

00:00:04.746 --> 00:00:09.196
So I'm going to check it off. The reasons it is not an equation is that the

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:13.626
quantities on either side of the equal sign are not actually equal to one

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:18.070
another. We know that 2 plus 2 equals 4, and we know that 4 is not equal to 5.

00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:22.668
So this is not a true equation. When you do the same check on this equation

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.980
right here. Once again, since 2 plus 2 equals 4, that means we have 4=4, which

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:30.416
is an equation. So we won't check this answer choice. n plus 2 equals n plus 3

00:00:30.938 --> 00:00:35.991
is a little bit trickier. Now, what is the problem here? Although I didn't tell

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:40.985
you that this is an answer that you should have selected. The issue is that, no

00:00:40.997 --> 00:00:45.982
matter what value you substitute in for n, the two sides of this equation will

00:00:45.994 --> 00:00:50.788
never be equal to one another. The right-hand side, that says n plus 3, will

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.530
always be 1 larger than the left=hand side.

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:58.166
So for example, if we let n equal zero, we have 0 plus 2 equals 0 plus 3, which

00:00:58.178 --> 00:01:03.114
leaves us with 2 equals 3, and that is not true. A similar thing will happen no

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:07.564
matter what number you plug in for n. The same thing is not true of this

00:01:07.576 --> 00:01:11.809
equation, 1 plus n plus 1 equals n plus 2. In fact, the opposite is true. No

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:16.028
matter what value we substitute in for n here, this equation will always be

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.421
true. This is a special kind of equation that we'll talk about in just a second.
