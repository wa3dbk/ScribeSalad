00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.180
The first thing that happens when
we create a new notebook is that

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.100
the context realizes something has
changed in the objects within it namely,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.780
there's a new object.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.968
The context therefore sends the
NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeN-

00:00:19.968 --> 00:00:23.960
otification with a new
object as a payload.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.980
And as FetchedResultsController
receives the notification and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.180
sends a delegate message to
CoreDataTableViewController,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.730
which in turn tells
the TableView to update.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.890
So, there's no magic.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.150
It's just the MVC, delegate, and
notifications doing their job.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.830
Make sure you understand this, and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.750
then if you haven't already, add a
similar button to the node's controller.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.300
It's exactly the same thing.
