00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Now that we have shown clique to be NP-complete,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.290
we can easily say that independent set is NP-complete

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.010
because we can transform a graph for which you want to solve clique

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.780
easily into a graph on which you can solve independent set,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.340
and then that will give you a solution for clique.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.810
So we already have that reduction down here, which of course will make Carol quite unhappy.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.760
And we also had the reduction from independent set to vertex cover

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.110
because we showed that solving vertex cover on the graph

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.480
is basically the same thing as solving independent set.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.890
So vertex cover is also NP-complete.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.890
So Alice is now unhappy as well.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.060
And what this means is the following:

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.480
The problems that Alice, Bob, and Carol are trying to solve

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.760
are as hard as any problem in NP can become.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.180
Any problem that you can solve in polynomial time,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.380
if you have had this magic "if-better" function available, would also be solvable

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.340
in polynomial time if we found a polynomial-time algorithm for any of their problems.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.300
Or even, in other words, if you found a polynomial-time algorithm for vertex cover,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.270
independent set, clique or SAT, what this would mean is that you have found a way

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.380
to simulate the if-better function in polynomial time.

00:01:19.380 --> 99:59:59.000
You can simulate a nondeterministic RAM on a deterministic RAM in polynomial time.
