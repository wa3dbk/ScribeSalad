00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.490
In ARP, a host queries with an IP address, broadcasting that query

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.650
to every other node on the network. That query will be of a form, who has a

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.720
particular IP address, such as 130.207.160.47, and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.990
that particular host. Who has that IP

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.820
address on the LAN will respond with

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.010
the appropriate MAC address. So the ARP query

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.520
is a broadcast that goes to every host on the LAN from the host that wants the

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.750
answer to the query and the response is

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.700
a unicast response with the MAC address as the

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.680
answer. That's returned to the host that issued

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.540
the query. When the host that issues the query

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.010
receives a reply, it starts to build what's

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.570
called an ARP table. It's ARP table then maps

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.590
each IP address on the local area

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.270
network to the corresponding MAC address. Now, instead

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.350
of broadcasting a ARP query to discover

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.480
the MAC address corresponding with this IP address,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.410
the host can simply consult its local ARP table. Let's now take a look at what

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.170
the host does with this information. When the host wants to send a packet to.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.470
The destination with a particular IP address. It takes that IP packet and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.440
encapsulates it in an Ethernet frame

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.190
with the corresponding destination MAC address. Essentially,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.600
it puts that IP packet inside of an Ethernet frame. So before it sends

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.990
the IP packet with that destination IP address it first puts the packet

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.320
inside a larger Ethernet frame with its own source MAC

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.410
address and the destination MAC address from its local ARP table.
