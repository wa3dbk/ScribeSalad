00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.327
Welcome back. In the last unit, we compared graphs and equations to determine if

00:00:04.327 --> 00:00:08.590
they intersected, were parallel or if they represented the same line. In this

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.787
unit, we'll focus on exponent rules and polynomials. By the end of this unit, I

00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:17.077
hope you'll be able to find patterns while working with exponents and use those

00:00:17.077 --> 00:00:21.564
patterns to help you add, subtract, multiply and divide polynomials. Only one

00:00:21.564 --> 00:00:25.854
lesson in this unit will focus on exponents, but we'll use everything we learn

00:00:25.854 --> 00:00:28.536
here for the rest of the unit with polynomials.
