00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
You've already learned quite a lot in the last 6 units:

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.620
How to recognize challenging problems,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.150
the theory of NP-completeness, and how you can,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.030
nevertheless, solve these challenging problems using exact techniques

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.280
such as search trees, pre-processing, or fixed parameter tractability, or approximate method.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.900
So approximation algorithms, or randomization.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.430
So far, all of the problems that we have looked at have had 1 thing in common:

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.540
If you gave the computer enough time, and it has enough memory, then eventually you'll get an answer.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.210
So, of course, if you have an intractable problem, say an NP-complete one

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.710
or an NP-hard one, then, of course, you will have to wait a long, long time to get your answer.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.730
The computer is, at least in principle, able to give you an answer.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.750
In this unit, we will be looking at the ultimate limits of computation.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.020
What that means is, I will show you some problems

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.010
that are not hard to solve, but are impossible to solve.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.870
So the computer has no idea how to do this.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.960
And there's 2 surprising things waiting for you.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.700
First of all, these problems here are very simple, surprisingly simple.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.810
And the second thing is, although these problems are totally impossible to solve,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.240
actually, your computer is probably solving them every day.

00:01:09.240 --> 99:59:59.000
So some baffling things await you in this final unit of our course.
