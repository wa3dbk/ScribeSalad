00:00:00.062 --> 00:00:04.697
Since the denominator of our fractions on the right side is 4, to get rid of the

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:09.272
fractions, we just need to multiply both sides by 4. Remember that since we're

00:00:09.273 --> 00:00:13.564
multiplying this whole side by 4, we need to multiply each term by 4. The 4

00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:18.750
distributes. And we get 4y equals negative 5x plus 51. Well, I like that a lot

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:19.147
better.
