00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.890
Now we get to add a second
view controller to our app.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.030
Adding another screen and
view controller to manage that screen

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.000
is just what we need to turn pitch
perfect into the app we want.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.020
Open the library panel
here on the bottom right.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.640
If you don't see the library panel,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.350
make sure you have the objects
library button selected.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.495
It's the third one from the left here.

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:24.330
Drug our view controller onto
the storyboard, like this.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.800
You may want to position
it as I have here

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.310
to the right of the records
view controller.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.750
Let's make it clear we're
going to the new screen.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.620
We can use our old trick of changing
the background color of the new

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.540
view controllers view so
that it's something other than white.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.350
Here I've selected the view
controller and it's view.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.680
You can see Storyboard has automatically
zoomed in to the second view controller.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.500
With this view selected, I'm going to
change the background color to something

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.480
other than white, in my case, green.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.070
Set it to whichever
color you prefer just so

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.380
that it's something other than white.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.670
Now, we need to make storyboard
transition from our recording view

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.629
controller, which is just called view
controller, to our new view controller.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.900
For now, what I want is to connect
it to the stop recording button.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.860
First, select the stop recording
button here in the document outline.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.000
Then you can hold down
the control key and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.160
drag directly from it to
the new view controller.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.200
Select the show segue.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.770
You should see the new symbol with
the arrow connecting the two view

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.570
controllers, seen here.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.580
This is called a segue.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.390
Remember we previously wired
up the stop recording button

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.720
to the stop recording function,
VN IB action.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.844
It means the stop recording
button is doing two things.

00:01:35.844 --> 00:01:38.807
It will call the code in our
recording view controller and

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:43.530
it will also cause the segue to occur,
moving us to the next view controller.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.890
Now you may be thinking yourself,
wait a minute, where is the code for

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.220
that green view controller?

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.490
We never created any class.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.650
You're correct.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.520
Storyboard is using
the default UI view controller,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.800
not a subclass that you wrote.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.310
And there's just a plain UI view

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.370
of which we've changed
the background color.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.380
Let's run this app and see.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.280
If we click Tap to Record and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.970
then Stop the Recording, we can see
that the Ui navigation controller

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.520
has transitioned us to the second
view controller, that's green.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.780
Take a moment to notice the new bar,
called a navigation bar, and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.220
the back button labeled Back.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.550
This is a pre-built back button that
will return us to the previous view

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.950
controller, a sort of
breadcrumb if you will.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.900
We have just scratched the surface
of UI Navigation Controller.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.900
Because that is all we need for

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.370
now in order to build out
the pitch perfect app.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.650
In UI fundamentals you're going to
learn about UI Navigation Controller

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.780
in much further detail.
