00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.382
We find the lowest common denominator by factoring each of these denominators

00:00:04.382 --> 00:00:09.400
first. The first denominator will have factors of x plus 2 times x minus 6,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.674
since factors of 12 that sum to negative 4 are positive 2 and negative 6. The

00:00:14.674 --> 00:00:20.284
factors for x squared minus 36 would be x minus 6 and x plus 6. This is just the

00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:24.680
difference of two perfect squares. We can see that both of the denominators

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.464
share a common factor of x minus 6. So this is the factor they share, and we

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:33.598
list it in the middle. The other factor of this denominator is x plus 2, and the

00:00:33.598 --> 00:00:38.110
other factor of this denominator is x plus 6. Finally, we just multiply all

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.473
these factors together to get our lowest common denominator, right here.
