00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.100
This is great. We've got our data frame, with our conditional

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.500
means measured in months. Now it's just time to plot them.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.380
Your final programming task here is to make the plot of

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.830
mean friend count versus age measured in months. Be sure that

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.370
you use a line to connect all the points. Just like

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.250
we did in this plot. Now I'm going to make this a

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.200
little bit harder. I want you to subset the data frame

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.560
as well. I want you to only investigate users, with ages less

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.390
than 71. The plot that you create won't be automatically graded so

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.840
I encourage you to check out what we did in the solution video.
