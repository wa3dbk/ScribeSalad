00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.401
So, this is pretty cool. We can make a web application. We can respond to

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:07.480
different kinds of requests. We can embed it with our search engine. There's one

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.572
pretty big problem with it still and that's that every time we start the server,

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:15.440
we have to do this full web crawl. Since we're using our toy test site, we're

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.098
sort of okay with this because it doesn't take long and we expect that site to

00:00:19.098 --> 00:00:23.854
be up most of the time. But if we were trying to build a real search engine and

00:00:23.854 --> 00:00:27.575
want it to crawl a large chunk of the web, well, we need to crawl billions of

00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:31.308
pages. This takes a long time. So, we can't do that every time we need to start

00:00:31.308 --> 00:00:35.002
the server. We might need to restart the server frequently. Maybe the server

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:39.050
crashes, hopefully it doesn't if we built things correctly. But we might need to

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.250
start it on lots of machines, we might need to restart it when things change.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.158
So, we don't want to have to re-crawl the web every time. We're in a bit of a

00:00:46.158 --> 00:00:50.845
pickle. We need a way of storing the results with a crawl in a file and loading

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:54.955
it so we don't have to do the crawl every time. And if it's a really big crawl,

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:58.739
talking about billions of pages, well, a regular file isn't going to be enough.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.018
We're going to assume it's small enough that we can use regular file for that.

00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:04.873
We're not going to get into how you might want to manage this if you have a

00:01:04.873 --> 00:01:08.589
really, really large amount of data here. So, what we need to do is learn how to

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:12.684
perform the crawl instead of needing to crawl the web every time we start the

00:01:12.684 --> 00:01:16.504
server. Instead, we want to load an existing web corpus. So, to do that we're

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:19.580
going to need you learn about how to read and write from files. That's what

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.053
we'll do next.
