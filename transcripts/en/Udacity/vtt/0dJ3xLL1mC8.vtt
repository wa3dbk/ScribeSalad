00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.920
Direct currently has some
technical limitations.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.310
The first is disposition notification.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.700
In certain situations,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.950
it's very important to know that
a direct message has been received.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.850
Clinical laboratories, for example,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.990
are using Direct to send results
back to ordering physicians.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.060
An abnormal result may
require urgent attention.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.890
Confirmation of delivery is available,
although currently not very robust.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.020
But it is accomplished
using encrypted and

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.430
signed message disposition notification.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.020
Efforts to make this more robust
are discussed in the text.
