00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.055
Here's another problem involving interest. This time you invest money at 7% and

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:10.089
8%. You invested a total of $25,000 and your yearly interest was 1,900. How much

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:14.882
money did you invest at each rate? To get started solving this problem let's

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:19.320
first come up with some equations. We'll let x be the amount of money we

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.002
invested at 7% and y be the amount of money we invested at 8%. Using these

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:29.227
variables write two equations for representing this problem. Use the ideas of

00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:33.911
amount, and amount, plus the total amount. And interest plus interest should be

00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:37.731
total interest. And make sure to use those variables. Good luck.
