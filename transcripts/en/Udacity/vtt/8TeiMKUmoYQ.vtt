00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.210
On the left he puts what most people often think of as the first part of

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.310
this process, acquiring and munging data.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.190
And often this is what takes the most time.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.260
On the right, Ben places interactive data visualization,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.960
which is typically what people think of as the final product.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.650
A pretty chart, a graphic once all the hard work has been done.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.180
Ben places the domain he thinks most naturally fits above each stage.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.189
The first of which being computer science.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.180
In the larger context of data visualization, or data science as a whole,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.412
the acquire and parsing stages are often concerned with data ingestion

00:00:42.412 --> 00:00:48.250
be it web scraping, log collection, database accesses, et cetera.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.540
And building scalable extract transform and load pipelines, or ETL.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.810
A second group here of filtering and mining represents what is often most

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.980
associated with data science, and many people consider it the most exciting.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.130
This includes modeling, data mining, and exploratory analysis, and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.670
applying statistical and mathematical theory to discover insights.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.790
Because of this,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.955
Ben Fry labels the second stage as associated with statistics and data mining.

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:25.970
While people often think the second stage is, so

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.490
to say, where the magic happens and the models are built.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.070
I really want to stress the importance of the process as a whole.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.780
After all,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.300
if you didn't have any data in a readily accessible form, you couldn't model it.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.690
And even once you have a model, if you can't present and

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.470
communicate your results.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.610
They might as well never have happened.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.070
The third stage here focuses on the visual representation of your data, and

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.750
how you present it graphically, thus is most associated with

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.030
the fields of graphic design and visualization theory.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.670
It is in this third stage that we experiment with different visual encodings to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.870
present our data in the most effective manner.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.220
And the fourth stage here is concerned with how a reader or

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.530
your audience might interact with your visualization.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.560
Techniques from the field of information visualization and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.580
human computer interaction apply here,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.620
to determine how best to design your graphic or visualization such that it

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.810
enables your user to potentially discover insights for themselves.
