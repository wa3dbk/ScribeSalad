00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The interesting thing is that we can do this

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
for all parts of the program.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For every single function in the program,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we can look up the changes and find out which problems

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
were addressed in that specific file or in that specific function.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What we get this way is a defect count for every single location.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That is, the number of problems that have been fixed in that very file or function.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In 2007, my students and I built such a tool that would create

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
such a mapping from the version databases and problem databases

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
of open source programs.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
For instance, we would apply this on Firefox--the web browser--

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in order to find out where the most defects were.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
More specifically, we would be looking at security defects--

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that is, problems that relate to security issues.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What we would get is precisely the location where the most

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
security bugs would be.
