Now that you know where the first sentence ends, you also know where the second

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.186
sentence starts. Write a method, public String getSecondSentence that returns a

00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:11.962
piece of the book, starting after the first sentence and ending after the end

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:16.887
of the second sentence. Here's a hint, indexOf has several versions, one of

00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:20.121
them just finds the first occurrence of something but there are others that are

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.010
more flexible.
