00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.230
You have just seen how to add context and

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.010
narrative to your data through the process of visualization.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.300
We've also seen how journalists traditionally do this.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.170
And how data journalism reimagines this process.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.040
&gt;&gt; You also learned how important it is to verify and validate your data.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.880
You learned a little bit about the different types of biases that can exist,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.720
such as data bias, author bias and reader bias.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.680
&gt;&gt; Now that we're comfortable with different types of narrative

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.540
structures within visualizations, let's see how we can apply these to our own.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.570
We'll use interaction and

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.260
animation to add a new depth of field to our particular visualization.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.710
In this case, the World Cup example.
