00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:02.139
Welcome to Problem Set #1.

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:05.742
I'm Chin Hun and I'm your TA for the class.

00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:09.212
Today I will be walking you through Problem Set #1.

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:17.787
And for Problem Set #1, our goal is convert an image from color to black and white.

00:00:17.787 --> 00:00:22.392
To convert an image from color to black and white,

00:00:22.392 --> 00:00:26.995
we first have to understand how colored digital images are represented.

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:35.421
The most common format is to specify how much red, green, and blue is presented at each pixel.

00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:37.879
Each color is called a channel.

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:46.240
Zero means that a color is fully absent, whereas 255 means that color is fully saturated.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.011
Therefore, if at a pixel all three channels—red, green, and blue—

00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:55.582
are zero means that pixel is black, like such.

00:00:55.582 --> 00:01:03.156
Or if all three channels—red, green, and blue—are 255 that pixel is fully white,

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:05.974
just like the background of this slide.

00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:08.637
So how are pixels represented in CUDA?

00:01:08.637 --> 00:01:14.687
In CUDA code each pixel is represented as an unsigned char4 struct.

00:01:14.687 --> 00:01:21.463
This structure has four unsigned char components named x, y, z, and w.

00:01:21.463 --> 00:01:31.908
X is your red channel, Y is your green channel, Z is your blue channel, and W is your alpha channel.

00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:37.058
The fourth component, char W here, is reserved for the Alpha channel,

00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:40.169
which carries the transparency information.

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:42.567
We will ignore this component throughout our homework,

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:48.775
as this does not pertain to transforming the image from color to greyscale.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:53.180
How do we convert a color image to a black and white image?

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.053
One possibility was simply to take the average of all of the three color channels.

00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:02.622
For example, add R to G to B—

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:07.461
the channels R stands for red, G stands for green, and B stands for blue—

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:09.895
and simply divide it by three.

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:14.316
But it turns out that our eyes don't respond to all colors equally.

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:21.724
We're more sensitive to the color green than red and more sensitive to the color red than to the color blue.

00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:26.135
Taking into account our varying sensitivities to the different color channels,

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:29.063
we are going to use this following formula instead.

00:02:29.063 --> 00:02:34.620
We are going to multiply the color channel red by 0.299,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.986
we are going to multiply the color channel green by 0.587,

00:02:39.986 --> 00:02:46.059
and we are going to multiply the color channel blue by 0.114.

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.096
So let's look at Problem Set #1,

00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:51.865
and let's look at the code that you will actually have to write for this assignment.

00:02:51.865 --> 00:02:55.836
For Problem Set #1, you have two jobs that you have to do.

00:02:55.836 --> 00:03:02.343
For the first part, your job is to fill in this RGBA to greyscale function.

00:03:02.343 --> 00:03:09.190
We will pass you in an array of uchar4 which represents the pixel in the color image,

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.897
and your job is to convert each pixel in this 2D array into an intensity value

00:03:15.897 --> 00:03:20.595
that you will write back to this 1D array called greyImage.

00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:26.169
You will follow the formula that we talked about in the previous slide, as seen here.

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:32.649
In part two, the kernel's already filled in for you but with incorrect dimensions and spot is empty.

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:36.718
So your job for part two is to fill in the body of the kernel

00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:42.091
and to correct the dimension of block size and grid size.

00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:47.730
We have included reference code that performs the same calculation of serial on the CPU for your reference,

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.353
and if you have any questions or if you run into any problems,

00:03:51.353 --> 00:03:54.335
feel free to post on the forums, and I'll be there to help you.

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:59.272
Lastly, I would like to thank Eric Elson of Royal Caliber and Mike Roberts

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:02.209
for their fantastic job with writing the homeworks.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.046
They have also written the script for this video today as well,

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:09.000
so thank you Eric and Mike.
