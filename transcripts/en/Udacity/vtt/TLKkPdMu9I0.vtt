00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One way to reason about this is just to write out all of the strings that this matches--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
0, 1, 2--all the way up to 9. Ten different 1-digit strings.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Zero is certainly in this set, so 0 matches 0 through 9.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
One matches 0 through 9. Remember the interpretation is everything

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
between and including the beginning up to and including the end.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Ten, however, is a 2-letter string. It's too big.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This regular expression only matches ten strings that are each 1 letter long.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This one doesn't match. Similarly, 11 is just too large.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
05 is very tempting, but regular expressions are string equations, not mathematical equations.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
While 5 and 05 might have the same mathematical meaning,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
our regular expression, which is concerned with strings,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
matches this one-letter string "5" but not this two-letter string "05".

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Then "9"--well, that's right on the border. We totally match it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
"Isak Dinesen"--we don't match this for a number of reasons.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
First, it doesn't contain 0 through 9, and second it's much too long.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
"Isak Dinesen" was a pseudonym adopted by Karen Dinesen, a Danish author

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
who wrote Out of Africa.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Let's imagine that's Africa.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
These regular expressions sound super cool,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and I'm going to show you how to use them in Python programs,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.092
but that's going to require one more step.
