Okay. And, what I'd like you to do

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.750
know, I'd like you to update your fizzbuzz.html template,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.830
make it inherit from base.html, and fill in

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.210
the content block. And when you're done you should

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.610
get a result that looks like this. When I go to /fizzbuzz now, we have my common

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.610
header, and then we have the content of fizzbuzz.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.300
So go ahead and paste the result in here.
