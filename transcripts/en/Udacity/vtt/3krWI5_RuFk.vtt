00:00:00.173 --> 00:00:02.138
In this lecture we're going to talk about GPU hardware

00:00:02.138 --> 00:00:04.078
and how that affects the programming model.

00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:08.447
Let's summarize what we've learned so far about the GPU programming model and start adding to it.

00:00:08.447 --> 00:00:12.290
In our last lecture, we learned about the programmers view of the GPU.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.296
I'm going to summarize that and then start adding some more details to it.

00:00:15.296 --> 00:00:22.560
Your job as the programmer is to divide up your program into smaller computations called kernels.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.797
A kernel in our case is a C or C++ function.

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:29.800
The key idea of a kernel is that it's going to be performed by many threads.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.865
A thread is a path of execution, a thread of execution through the program code.

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:38.894
I've drawn them as wiggly lines here because they're not necessarily all going

00:00:38.894 --> 00:00:40.829
to take the same path through that code.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.300
There might be branches like if statements or switch statements.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.258
There might be loops--for loops, to loops.

00:00:47.258 --> 00:00:50.373
You don't know in advance what path you're going to take.

00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:51.704
This is not straight-line code.

00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:55.910
In fact, different threads might take different paths.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.007
There might be a thread which takes a completely different path.

00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:05.218
The key thing about threads is that they come in thread blocks.

00:01:05.218 --> 00:01:08.923
A thread block is a group of threads that cooperate to solve a sub-problem.

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:12.195
A GPU program launches many threads to run one kernel,

00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:15.364
and then they all run to completion and exit.

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:18.842
The program launches many threads to run the next kernel like bar.

00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:22.572
Another thing to notice about the way I drew this is that, you notice

00:01:22.572 --> 00:01:24.974
I have a different number of thread blocks with a different number of threads.

00:01:24.974 --> 00:01:28.144
That's actually something you can pick for each kernel.

00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:32.324
And we'll talk later why you would choose different numbers of threads,

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:34.223
different number of thread blocks, how you would organize these.

00:01:34.223 --> 00:01:36.687
That's the programmer's view of the GPU.
