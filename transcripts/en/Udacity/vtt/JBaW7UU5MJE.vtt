00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.908
I'm going to trace name, friends and numFriends. I start at the first line,

00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:10.045
create a new person with the name Sara. So name will be set to the name I

00:00:10.045 --> 00:00:16.116
passed in. Friends is empty, numFriends is 0. And then we're done with the

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:22.130
constructor. We do the same thing for Chenghan. And now we add a friend to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.813
Sara. So in addFriend, friends will get longer, it'll be friends plus Chenghan

00:00:27.813 --> 00:00:32.948
and numFriends will go up by one. And then that method's done, so we go up to

00:00:32.948 --> 00:00:39.158
the next line. In sara.unfriend, we shorten friends, we replace Chenghan in a

00:00:39.158 --> 00:00:46.340
space with nothing. So friends goes back to being nothing and then we're done.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.500
Something went wrong here, though. I clearly have no friends in the list here.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.932
But here, my number of friends is still 1. We saw when that happened. In

00:00:55.932 --> 00:01:02.032
unfriend, we updated the list of friends, but didn't update the number of

00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:04.303
friends.
