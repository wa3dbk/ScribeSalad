00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.480
In this first final exam problem, we were

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.830
tasked with writing the Lexar for a new

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.189
programming language. There are seven types of tokens,

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.630
and four of which are simple operators. We

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.570
have plus, minus, times and divide. So, here

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.850
I've written the token rule for the plus

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.800
operator. The first line is a regular expression

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.350
that matches the plus symbol. And then we return

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.250
the token unchanged. And for the rest of the operators,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.510
we're going to follow that same format. We're just going to change

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.070
the name of the function and we're going to change the

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.560
symbol to which it matches. Our next token is the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.930
identifier. In our programming language, this will be the names

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.940
that we have for things. So it can be something

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.560
like. My _variable or something even more interesting like just

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.590
the word Andy. More precisely, in our program language, an identifier

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.660
is a non-empty sequence of letters and underscores, where

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.860
the first character is not an underscore. So, we can

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.590
write our rule for that pretty simply. Here I

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.950
have a function, t_IDENT. And the regular expression is pretty

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.970
simple. The first character, and it has to be

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.830
at least one character because it's a non-empty string, it's

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.240
just going to be some letter. And then we're going

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.690
to be followed by zero or more letters or underscores.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.860
So strings in this language are very similar to

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.660
strings in Python. We can have single or double quotes,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.880
but in this particular language, for which we are designing

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.650
our Lexar, we don't have any escape sequences. This actually

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.490
makes the expression to match the strings much simpler. So,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.400
the first rule I'm writing is just for single quoted

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.030
strings. The rule for double quoted strings is going to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.100
be very similar. It's just that the right of expression

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.880
to which we are matching is going to be slightly different.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.460
When I go over the code at the end and I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.800
show you the finished product, I'll show you what that looks

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.350
like. But for now let's just concentrate on single quotas strings. Here

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.450
I require that the string begins and ends with a single

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.020
quote and is a sequence of zero or more, kind of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.370
an empty string, characters that aren't the single quote. Since we

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.310
don't have escape characters that's all we need. So here I'm taking

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.410
out the quotes from the beginning and end of

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.810
the string, that way the value of this token is

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.540
the string itself. And I'm setting the type to

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.110
string. All caps. Numbers in this language are a little

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.930
bit different than Python. First off, the only numbers

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.520
we have are positive integers. So negative 5, and 5.5

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.730
are both not valid numbers in this language. So, one

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.560
example of a good one would be 5, we're also

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.820
allowed to put underscores anywhere in the number, as long as it's not the first

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.158
character in the number. So, 5_5 _ _ _ is going to be

00:02:43.158 --> 00:02:48.370
equivalent to just 55. A lot of languages actually have

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.810
this feature because it's easier to read 1, 2, 3, _, 4, 5, 6. Similar

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.070
to how we often put a 123,456.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.580
So here I've started writing out the token rule

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.250
for numbers in this language. The first character has to

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.790
be a digit, zero thru nine. And afterwards we

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.690
can have zero or more digits or underscores. Now we

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.540
want the value of the number token to be

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.020
the number, the integer, that it represents. However if we

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.620
just return the string, or try to call some. Integer

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.240
conversion on it, we're just going to get a lot

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.730
of underscores and it's not really going to work

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.390
and it's not what we want. We want to take 5_5_

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.860
_ _ and just get 55. So, my strategy

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.450
is going to be to go through each character in

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.340
our string, append any digits to a new string,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.170
ignore any underscores. And once I'm done call ent onto

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.170
that string, to get the integer that the original token

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.940
represented. So, here I have the finished function. I want to

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.450
go through each character like I planned. If it's

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.360
not an underscore I'm going to append it onto our

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.160
temp string and then call ent on that temp

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.890
string to get the new value. And here I

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.930
have the finished code. We have our basic operators,

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.960
plus, minus, times, and divide, the identifier function we

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.320
wrote, single and double strings, [UNKNOWN] the only difference

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.740
here is that we have single quotes right here,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.380
double quotes right there. And lastly, the number token function that we wrote.
