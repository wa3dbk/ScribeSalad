00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.100
So now that you've survived the bunny uprising, we're ready to

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.470
get to the main goal of this class, as far as building

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.090
the search engine. Our goal is to improve the results by finding

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.670
the web page instead of just returning a list of all the

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.830
web pages that match a query. As the web has grown, it's

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.040
become more and more important for search engines to do this ranking

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.410
well. That what really distinguished Google

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.250
from previous search engines was they

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.270
had a much smarter way of ranking pages that produced more useful

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.600
results, where the first one or two results in response

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.980
to a search query were often the very thing that

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.650
the user was searching for. So now we're ready to

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.780
start thinking about the problem of how to rank web

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.340
pages. Let's start by recapping how our search engine works.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.950
So we started by building a crawler. And what the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.505
crawler did, and this is what we did in units

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:50.270
one, two, and three, what the crawler did was follow all

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.480
the links in the web pages. Following those links, building up an index.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.400
And the end result of the crawler, after units four

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.260
and five was we had an index. By the end

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.530
of unit five, it was a, a table where we could look up a key word,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.400
and we would find the entry where that

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.690
key word might appear. And we'd follow, and we

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.800
could look through each of those entries to find the one

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.500
that matched, and that would match the key word that we

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.050
were looking for. And as it's value, it would have a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.430
list of all the urls where that keyword appears. And the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.130
order of those urls in that list was determined just by

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.850
how we added them to the crawl. Every time we encountered

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.200
new page, we indexed that page, and we added a url

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.920
for that keyword. So the one that's first in this list is

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.590
just the one that we happen to find first. So

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.520
say it's the c page. The one that's second would be

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.270
the one that we find next. And it's this page. So,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.690
this doesn't tell us anything about which page is best. So

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.160
the order of the URLs in the list and what we

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.300
were getting as our output just depends on the order that

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.770
things happen to go in the crawl. When the web was

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.030
really small, which was quite a while ago now, this was

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.330
sort of okay. That there were only a few pages that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.030
might match a given keyword, and you could look through them

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.110
all and decide which one you wanted. With the web today,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.890
this doesn't work at all. There are thousands of pages that

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.070
match any interesting keyword. Maybe millions. Certainly many more than you

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.000
want to look through by hand. So the most important thing

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.630
that a good search engine does is to figure out how

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.040
to rank these pages so the one that's at the front of

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.710
the list is the one the user wants. So that's our goal for

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.970
the rest of this unit, to figure out how to rank pages. Before

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.370
we do this for web pages, we're going to do something very similar, but

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.710
perhaps easier to relate to. We're going to

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.560
talk about how we decide who's popular.
