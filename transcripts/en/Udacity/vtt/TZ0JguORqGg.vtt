00:00:00.147 --> 00:00:03.219
So far we've had a stationary
point of view while GigaGal

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:04.628
moves around the screen.

00:00:04.628 --> 00:00:07.283
That puts some pretty severe
limits on our level design though,

00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:10.201
given that we only have one screen's
worth of platforms to work with.

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:14.230
Let's fix that by allowing the camera
to follow GigaGal around the screen.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.154
While we're at it, we'll also remove the
floor at the bottom of the screen and

00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:20.360
detect when GigaGal has
fallen to her doom.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.443
Finally, while the chase camera is great
for debug purposes, it'd sure be useful

00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:27.962
to be able to move the camera
independently from GigaGal's position.

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:30.280
So we'll add in some debug
camera controls as well.
