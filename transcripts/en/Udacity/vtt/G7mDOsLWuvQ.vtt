00:00:00.755 --> 00:00:02.880
Press can help you achieve
your goals quickly.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.670
You'll want to have writers and

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.220
tech magazines mentioning you to help
spread the word about your products.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.050
If you can, getting a tweet, a public
donation, or a mention from a relevent

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.830
celebrity or peer leader who supports
your product can be a huge help.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.240
Working with a peer firm
can be expensive, but

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.580
might be worth considering.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.490
If you have a big bang launch,
like a KickStarter campaign or

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.362
any other specific launch date that
you want to create a big buzz around.

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:30.180
PR firms can help you get
big names supporters or

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.710
celebrities to promote your business.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.612
However, if it's too early for
your start up to spend budget on PR,

00:00:36.612 --> 00:00:38.403
you can always do it yourself.

00:00:38.403 --> 00:00:41.542
If you choose to do it yourself,
you will want to start by writing

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.694
a paragraph that you
like writers to write,

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:46.037
if you could have them
write whatever you want.

00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:49.654
This will help you clearly identify
how you want your company to be

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:51.450
presented in the press.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.835
Check out the instructor notes for for
an article on tips on how to do this.

00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:59.125
And let's see what Tali Saar has to
say about PR in the early stages of

00:00:59.125 --> 00:00:59.915
a start up.

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:04.209
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Tali Saar,
I'm the founder and CEO of Rooster.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.780
Before starting Rooster,
I spent four years at Google.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.010
I was on the marketing team and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.300
I was part of the founding team that
started a program called Google Engage,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.130
which developed today into Google
Partners, which is a global program.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.260
I left Google, I came to Silicon Valley,
and I was first employee for

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.860
a start up called Honey Book.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.700
And then I started my company
Rooster a year and a half ago.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.930
Rooster is a pay it forward movement.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.690
We're building a local network that
brings people together to help, borrow,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.460
and share with one another completely
for free in their local communities.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.440
So the idea is you join Rooster in your
location, and you create a profile,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.330
you have your real identity there,
and then the rules are you can ask for

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.630
whatever you need and help whenever
you can, but it has to be for free.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.530
So people use it to hand down used
furniture and items they don't need,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.890
like sofas, TVs, art supplies.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.430
They borrow baseball bats and baby cribs
from one another, they walk each other's

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.120
dogs, they help each other fix their
bike chains and things like that.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.950
We're currently launched in three cities
with thousands of users, and a lot of

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.750
them use it daily and meet each other,
and have all these great experiences.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.130
Starting with PR with low budget.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.264
It's funny a lot of start ups operate
under the assumption that doing PR

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:11.988
is this really complicated thing, and

00:02:11.988 --> 00:02:14.967
you have to build personal connections
with all the reporters, and

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:17.911
you have to be in the scene so
that they'll want to write about you.

00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:21.496
In my experience, not true at all.

00:02:21.496 --> 00:02:27.000
PR and journalists,
their job is to get these stories.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.740
And all you need to do is
understand their world and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.550
where they're coming from and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.120
know how to pitch them, and have
an interesting story to tell, right?

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.820
So you want to have a product
that's interesting enough,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.810
you want to have some kind traction,
or some kind of story,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.790
something that you know, can make a news
story and you'll know when you have it.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.150
And then you just want to be very
thoughtful of the journalists' time.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.750
So you want to research who your
journalists are that cover your space

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.470
that will potentially
be interested in this.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.330
Don't go and
pitch a thousand irrelevant people.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.420
And once you have those people,
just write in a very clear and

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.870
concise way and just consider that
they're getting hundreds of emails per

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.150
day and you have to grab
their attention first, right?

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.460
So just write a very compelling title,
write a very clear and concise pitch

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.215
about why this would be interesting
to them and just go and do it.

00:03:11.215 --> 00:03:13.965
Go and reach out to all these people,
and in my experience,

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:17.725
I got great stories in local press and
in the tech countries of the world,

00:03:17.725 --> 00:03:21.375
and everywhere I wanted just by giving
the right person the right story.
