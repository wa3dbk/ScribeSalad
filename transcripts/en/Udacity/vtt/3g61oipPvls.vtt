00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.890
Before we jump into intra-domain routing, let's take a

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.100
look at what a topology might look like inside

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.200
a single autonomous system. A topology inside an AS

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.920
consists of nodes and edges that connect them. The nodes

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.990
are sometimes called points of presence, or PoPs. A

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.370
PoP is typically located in a dense population center,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.310
so that it can be close to the PoPs

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.370
of other providers for easier interconnection. And, also close to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.500
other customers for cheaper backhaul to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.290
customers that may be pruchasing connectivity from

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.870
this particular AS. The edges between

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.460
pops are typically constrained by the location

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.630
of fiber paths. Which for the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.080
sake of convenience. Typically parallel major transportation

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.580
routes such as railroads and highways. Here's an example of a single AS topology

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.340
which is the Abilene Network, which is a research

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.350
network in the United States. Each of these locations

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.620
would be considered a Pop, and each of these

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.750
PoPs may have one or more edges between them.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.690
Georgia Tech is an autonomous system that connects at

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.130
the Atlanta PoP of the Abilene Network. Here's a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.510
close up of the Abilene Network in the south

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.360
eastern U.S.. The Abilene network connects to other universities

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.260
in the southeast near Atalanta and an internet exchange

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.760
point called SOX or southern crossroads. Now thus far

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.750
we've just talked about the topology of an autonomous

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.860
system which essentially defines the graph. The next step

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.890
is to compute paths over that topology. A process

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.650
called routing. Routing is the process by which nodes

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.750
discover where to forward traffic so that it reaches

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.890
a certain node. There are two types of intra-domain routing.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.520
One is called distance vector, and the other is called link

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.070
state. In the rest of this lesson we'll explore the two

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.750
different types of intra-domain routing and the advantages and disadvantages of

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.430
each of them. Let's first take a look at distance vector routing.
