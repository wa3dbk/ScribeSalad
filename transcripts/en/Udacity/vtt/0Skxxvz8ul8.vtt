00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.019
So we've been talking about
sort of MAC models and BLP,

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.560
Bell and
LaPadula is one example of that.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.280
That's the Biba model.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.970
Anytime we talk about a model, you have
to say what's the nature of the labels?

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.090
How do you compare them?

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.670
What kind of rules do you have?

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.230
Similar to what we had in the BLP model.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.880
The Biba model actually
is dual of the BLP model.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.370
And this duality is because rather
than focusing on confidentiality,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.390
which is what BLP focuses on,
Biba focuses on integrity.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.330
Integrity is defined, somebody being
able to write or corrupt data.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.790
The interpretation here is that, when
you say it is top secret information,

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.240
it is really top secret information or
something like that,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.720
or the information indeed
should be at that level.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.570
So think about the sort of, quality
of information rather than disclosure

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.130
of information that
confidentiality focuses on.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.080
So it's dual because the rules actually
are opposite of what we had in BLP.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.660
When you're concerned about
information quality or

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.440
integrity you want to read-up.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.704
Because anything below you is lower,

00:01:06.704 --> 00:01:10.370
I mean information with lower integrity,
you don't want to read that.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.687
So reads in BLP you have read-down,

00:01:12.687 --> 00:01:16.170
here you're going to have
read-up in the Biba model.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.440
BLP you have write-up,
in Biba you have write-down.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.240
So if you're at a certain level,
well, the integrity of

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.440
the information that you can create and
then write is either at your level or or

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.120
it's less integrity than
the level at which you are.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.710
So you're able to write down.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.000
Again, we're not concerned about
confidential disclosure here.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.250
We're concerned about
information integrity.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.260
Okay, so let's look at an example
to clarify this a bit.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.640
Let's say integrity could be high
integrity, medium integrity, or

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.420
low integrity.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.290
So saying information quality, think
of your favorite newspaper that you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.760
trust a lot, let's say for me,
it may be the New York Times,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.880
the information that appears there is
highly likely that I can trust it.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.960
Your supermarket tabloid,
let's say at the other end.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.180
Apologies to anyone who
may be a fan of those.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.900
When you're talking
with confidentiality,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.350
anyone, it's not about
controlling who can see it.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.910
It's controlling how
good the information is.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.460
So here it's high, medium, or low.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.380
Compartment could be similar to BLP,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.840
depending on what
the information is about.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.130
Really, it's the topics of the document
that contains that information.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.600
So label here.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.950
So anytime I quote a model I
said I want to talk about,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.280
what does the label look like.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.010
So, high, medium, low is ordered again,
totally ordered compartments,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.280
partially ordered,
because they are sets.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.450
And, the model says low
integrity information should

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.490
never flow into high
integrity documents.
