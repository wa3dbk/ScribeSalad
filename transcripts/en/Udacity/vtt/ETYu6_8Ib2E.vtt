00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In the previous unit, we have introduced the notion of NP-completeness.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.750
We have seen that many practically relevant problems fall into this category,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.330
such as vertex cover, clique, independent set, and of course the SAT problem

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.400
that we got to know in the last unit.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.810
Now, since the famous P versus NP problem is unsolved,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.070
there is no algorithm for any of these problems that is guaranteed

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.030
to run in polynomial time.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.830
Now, in the first unit, we met three computer scientists

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.460
who were working on these problems,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.980
and they did not know that their problems were NP-complete.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.960
So, in this unit, what I would like to teach you is how you can detect

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.260
that a problem is NP-complete.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.650
Then in the following units, we'll be dealing with counter measures.

00:00:41.650 --> 99:59:59.000
Once you have found out that your problem is NP-complete what can you do about it?
