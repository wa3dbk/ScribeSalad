00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.850
There are two different APIs for this: device orientation

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.300
and device motion, both of which are really interesting. Device

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.410
orientation tells you which way the device is tilted and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.970
which way it's pointed. This can be useful for implementing

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.070
a virtual joystick for example, or implementing a compass. Device

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.880
motion gives you events and information about what forces are

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.910
being applied to the device. Which makes it easy to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.550
tell if you're shaking the device but it also let's

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.930
you include and exclude gravity. This means it can tell you how the device is

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.800
oriented too. It's really a strict superset

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.390
of device orientation but it's a bit more

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.790
challenging to use in that way. So

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.450
given these descriptions in which of these scenarios

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.050
do you think you would use device orientation

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.870
And in which would you use device motion?
