00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.631
So what's going on here? Does 4 equal 6? Well no, this can't be right, we know 4

00:00:04.631 --> 00:00:09.266
isn't equal to 6. So this substitution method isn't working, something else is

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:13.680
going on with these two lines. If we remember that a solution to a system is a

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.224
point of intersection, then we know that these two lines can't intercept, we

00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:22.957
don't get a true statement. In other words the lines have to be parallel. Let's

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:23.609
make sure.
