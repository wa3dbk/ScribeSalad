00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.380
By far the best way to build
a sender application for

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.330
Android is to use the cast companion
library, or CCL for short.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.860
CCL provides a collection of ready to
use components that provide features and

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.770
behaviors recommended
by the US guidelines.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.450
CCL primarily helps you build media
centric apps, but it's also helpful for

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.530
data centric use cases as well.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.300
In this lesson, we'll take a look at
the major features and in the next,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.560
we'll see how it's used in practice.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.240
Now as you can see,
CCL does quite a bit for you.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.850
The main features include a ready
to go mini-controller and

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.250
a full screen player.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.100
Also included are notifications
to provide player controls when

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.950
your app is closed or out of focus.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.300
Lock screen controls, so

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.140
the user can maintain control
even if their phone is locked.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.520
Closed caption support and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.550
WiFi reconnection support in
case the connection drops.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.570
You control the CCL through
the VideoCastManager.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.310
This is a singleton and maintains
the state of the application, and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.520
keeps track of the connectivity to
the cast device behind the scenes.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.570
It also keeps track of the playback
status of the receiver for instance,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.300
if it's playing or paused.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.580
Now for data centric app you'd use
its analogue which is actually called

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.380
the data cast manager instead
of the video cast manager.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.490
Before you can use it you have to
initialize it as we're doing here.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.520
When you initialize it, you choose
which features you want enabled.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.010
The first argument is your
application context and

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.460
the second is the application
ID of your receiver.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.130
We'll get the third and
fourth arguments later.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.190
At this time you also select the types
of features you'd like enabled,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.550
here we're enabling quite a bit,
notifications, lock screen and so forth.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.940
When you use the CCL you want to create
an instance of the video cast manager

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.470
early, typically inside your
oncreate method of your activity.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.030
Before you do so though it's
a good idea to call this method

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.320
to check whether Google Play Services
is installed and updated.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.370
If it's not, the CCL will automatically
show the user dialog that will

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.730
direct them to take
the appropriate action.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.950
The third argument when we
initialize the CCL is for

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.680
a player control activity.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.410
If you leave it null,
CCL will provide one for you.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.960
This player shows automatically
during media playback, and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.410
provides controls to play,
pause, and seek.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.910
You can also start this
activity manually if you like,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.530
using the cast manager instance,
like this.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.220
This argument by the way is
an instance of media info and

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.130
that's the class used by cast to keep
track of metadata for a video or song.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.370
Check out a link to that
in the instructor notes.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.240
Now the fourth argument is a name
space of a custom message channel

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.950
if you'd like one created between
your sender and your receiver.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.580
Once the channel is created you
can easily send messages with just

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.940
a single message call.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.500
CCL also provides call back to inform
you whether a message was received and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.800
whether there was an error.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.220
And, if you have a data centric app,
the DataCastManager makes it easy for

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.220
you to add a number of channels,
each with their own name space.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.170
One of the ready to use components
CCL provides is the mini-controller.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.020
This is a small controller that can
be added to the layout XML of your

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.640
different activities.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.910
It's purpose is to allow the user to
browse to different pages of your app

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.660
while still being able
to control the cast.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.470
If you use this component,
in addition to the XML, you'll need to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.520
register it with the Video Cast Manager
inside your activities oncreate method.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.340
Also remember to
unregister in ondestroy.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.590
Behind the scenes, the Cast Manager
handles everything else including

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.640
updating its metadata, its playback
state, as well as hiding it when no

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.640
media is playing and for details on all
of this, check out the instructor notes.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.950
Another great ready to go
component is notifications.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.040
CCL shows these automatically when your
app is in the background or killed.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.660
All you have to do is indicate you
want this feature when you initialize

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.120
the video cast manager.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.370
Then, you need to keep CCL informed
when your app is active or not, and

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.520
you do this by incrementing or

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.500
decrementing the UI counter inside
your onStart and onStop method.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.870
Another excellent ready to go
feature are lock screen controls.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.890
When you enable this feature when you
initialize the video cast manager,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.900
a play pause button will automatically
go on Android devices running

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.140
Jellybean or higher.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.510
And as a added bonus, CCL
automatically provides the ability for

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.270
users to control the cast
device's system volume,

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.950
even if your application
is in the background and

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.179
you're screen is locked by using
the hardware controls on your phone.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.950
CCL makes reconnecting to
a running cast sessions easy, for

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.780
instance if the WiFi drops.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.950
To do so, it starts up a reconnection
service behind the scenes, and you have

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.870
to indicate you want this functionality
both when you initialize the video Cast

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.120
manager, and also by adding these
lines to your Android manifest.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.800
You need these permissions as well.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.560
Then, inside your on-create method,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.010
indicate that you want to reconnect
to an existing session if possible.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.540
In this parameter here is
a time out in seconds.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.600
In addition to helping you
out of the wi-fi drops,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.470
the reconnection services is also great
if your app is killed before you can

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.500
gracefully exit the cache section.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.279
If the user then restarts your app,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.050
you can automatically rejoin
the existing session.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.740
That's the CCL in a nutshell,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.940
we have an extensive PDF guide you can
find in the structure notes that will

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.920
provide details on how to use all
of these features in your app.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.710
And again, if you're building or
extending an Android app to work with

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.980
Cast the CCL is definitely
your best way to go.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.650
Another great resource is
the Cast video sample.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.230
This contains a handy guide on
downloading and installing the CCL and

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.880
connecting it to another
project inside Android Studio.
