00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to unit 4. Unit 4 is all about asymmetric cryptosystems.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We started talking in unit 3 about the paper that Diffie and Hellman wrote in 1976

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that introduced the idea of an asymmetric cryptosystem.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They didn't figure out how to build one quite yet.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They did figure out that key exchange protocol that we focused on in unit 3.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What we'll do in unit 4 is talk about the first successful asymmetric cryptosystem,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which is called "RSA," which is named for its inventors--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We'll look at how asymmetric cryptosystems can be used

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that we'll see how RSA is constructed, and we'll go in a fair bit of detail

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of why RSA works and why people believe it is secure.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Then we'll look at some of the problems that happen when people use RSA in practice.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Finally, we'll start talking about applications of asymmetric cryptosystems.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We won't get too far in applications in this unit,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but that'll be the main focus of unit 5.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
All the cryptosystems we've talked about so far have been symmetrical.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What that means is that the key used for encryption,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and the key used for decryption are the same.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This lead to the problem that we talked about in the previous unit

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
about how do you distribute this key between two parties,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but even if you can solve that problem using the same key for encryption

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
as you do for decryption limits what you can do with a cryptosystem.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
With an asymmetric cryptosystem we have different keys for encrypting and decrypting.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We'll call one of those keys ku--the u stands for public--

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and the other key kr--the r stands for private.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Unfortunately, both public and private start with the same letter p.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
That's why we use u and r to distinguish the two keys.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Public is a bit of a misnomer here.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
What we really mean is this key does not need to be kept secret.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It's still very important that it's generated in a particular way

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and it's associated with the right identity.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Before we get into the scheme for actually building a cryptosystem like this,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and until one is actually built, it seems like this should be impossible.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
If we reveal the way we do encryption,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that seems like we also reveal the inverse.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The way to do decryption.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
For the cipher to be correct, decryption must be the inverse of encryption.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
For most functions when you reveal how you compute the function in one direction,

00:02:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that also reveals how to compute the inverse.
