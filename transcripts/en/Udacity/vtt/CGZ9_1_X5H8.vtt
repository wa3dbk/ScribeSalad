00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.920
If we want an interval width of 1 10th, we need to choose the value that's 1

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.533
10th away from 1.5 and 1 10th away from 1.7. That value is 1.6. So, our new

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:15.181
intervals then are going from 1.5 to 1.6, and then from 1.6 to 1.7. Now, the

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:21.231
value of the function at 1.6 is negative. So, that means our zero must lie

00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:27.561
between 1.6 and 1.7 since we know that the function is positive at 1.7. So,

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:31.255
what have we done? Well, we started out with a big graph of this function, this

00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:35.805
quartic function. And we were able, through testing different values of x and f

00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:40.546
of x to zoom in on one of the zeros of that function. We've narrowed down it's

00:00:40.546 --> 00:00:44.742
location to a really small interval. An interval of just 1 10th. That's really

00:00:44.742 --> 00:00:47.118
tiny, considering we started out looking at the domain going from negative 3 to

00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:52.702
3. We can see how powerful the intermediate value theorem really is.
