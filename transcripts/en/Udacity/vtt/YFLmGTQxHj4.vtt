00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.570
Wow what I got is this value here. Seems hard to believe so let me show you how

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.760
I did it. Here is the code pattern in BlueJ. I defined my variable one million.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.232
I defined mystery as the product of one million by itself and I asked BlueJ,

00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:18.480
whats mystery and here I get this very mysterious number. So what's with that?

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.189
It looks like we need to understand a bit more about number types in Java than

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.770
just the difference between integers and floating point numbers.
