00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
And here, only one statement is correct.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.280
This statement down here is not correct.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.730
The clique can not contain multiple vertices

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.400
from one of these groups,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.150
and the reason why that is is

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.200
that in a clique, all vertices, as you know

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.110
must be connected to all other vertices,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.710
but this is not how we constructed the graph.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.360
When we constructed the graph, all we did was draw edges

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.990
between vertices from different groups,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.870
but we did not allow any edges between vertices

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.380
in that group,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.090
so if you find a clique

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.010
that can only contain exactly one vertex from each of these groups here.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.450
So if the graph has a clique of size m,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.660
and the clique can not contain

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.170
multiple vertices from a clause group,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.450
this means that you have to have exactly 1 vertex

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.630
from each clause group in your clique.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.840
So this statement here is definitely true.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.820
It contains at least one vertex from each clause group.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.840
But actually, we can make an even stronger statement and say

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.180
it contains exactly one vertex from each clause group.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.190
And now we're almost done with our reduction,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.700
because if you think about it, so

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.910
we solved clique for this graph we have constructed here,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.710
and we asked the decision problem,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.870
does the graph have a clique of size m

00:01:16.870 --> 99:59:59.000
where m is the number of clauses?
