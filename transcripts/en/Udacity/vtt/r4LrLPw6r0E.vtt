00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.750
Let us examine the connection between methods like means ends analysis and

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.689
problem reduction on one hand, and

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.480
human cognition on the other. Methods like means ends analysis,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.210
problem reduction and even generate and test, are sometimes called weak methods.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.180
They are weak because they make only little use of knowledge. Later on,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.630
we'll look at strong methods that are knowledge intensive. That will demand

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.130
a lot of knowledge. The good thing about those knowledge intensive methods is,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.759
that they will actually use knowledge about the world,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.810
to come up with good solutions in an efficient manner. On the other hand, those

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.186
knowledge intensive methods require knowledge, which is not always available. So

00:00:42.186 --> 00:00:46.489
humans, when they are working in a domain, in a world at which they are experts,

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.164
tend to use those knowledge intensive methods because they know a lot

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:55.480
about the world. But of course, you and I constantly work in worlds,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.830
in domains in which we are not experts. When we're not an expert in our domain,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.980
a domain that might be unfamiliar to us, then we might well go with

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.740
matters that are weak because they don't require a lot of knowledge.
