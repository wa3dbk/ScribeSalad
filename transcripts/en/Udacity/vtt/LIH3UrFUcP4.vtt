00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.180
And how do you make sure that your queries

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.670
work on appspot? Do you manually edit the index configuration

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.550
file? Do you run the queries on localhost first,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.040
before you update your app to appspot? Do you annotate

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.329
the properties that you want to be auto indexed

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.090
as at auto index in the entity file? And do

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.130
you just not worry about the single property queries? And

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.980
by that I mean you don't worry about creating indexes

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.390
for queries that only use a single property. Go ahead and check all that apply.
