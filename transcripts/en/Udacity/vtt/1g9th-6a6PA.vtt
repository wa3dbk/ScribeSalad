Now when I wanted to add touchscreen support to the synthesizer application, I

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.000
initially started with touch events. There

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.820
were two challenges, though. First, you'll notice

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.620
that on the desktop, if I don't have that touch event emulation turned

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.340
on, it doesn't actually work at all when I use the mouse. [NOISE] Of

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.980
course, this is expected. But I didn't really want two code

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.670
paths, one for mouse and one for touch. Secondly, I really

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.439
wanted to be able to have a drag across the keyboard.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.930
Play each note as you slid across it in turn. But with

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.100
the way touch delivers all the events to the originally touched

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.060
down element, I would have had to calculate the hit testing

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.070
myself for these. And that was kind of a pain. I

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.190
really wanted these touch events to be delivered to the down element

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.056
for each key. Instead what happens in this synth, is when I hit one key

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:58.870
[SOUND] and then drag, it doesn't actually move where the events are delivered.
