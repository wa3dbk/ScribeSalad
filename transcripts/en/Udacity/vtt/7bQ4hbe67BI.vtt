00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.691
The answer is 2 times the square root of 13. Great thinking if you found this

00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:08.902
number. We want to find the distance between these two points. So, we need to

00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:14.140
set up a right triangle with the vertical distance and the horizontal distance.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.730
The horizontal distance between x equals negative 1 and x equals positive 3 is

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.870
4. We have to move four units in the x direction to get from x equals negative

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.983
1 to x equals positive 3. Now we need to find the vertical distance. We start

00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:35.287
at y equals 2, which is here, and then we go all the way up to y equals 8,

00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:40.965
which is here. So, this vertical distance on the y axis is a distance of 6

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:46.584
units. Once we've found these two legs of our right triangle, we can use the

00:00:46.584 --> 00:00:52.203
Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse. So, we'll have this leg squared,

00:00:52.203 --> 00:00:58.546
plus this leg squared, equals d squared, our hypotenuse. We solve this equation

00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:03.367
to get d squared equals 52. And then we take the square root of both sides to

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:08.525
get d is equal to the square root of 52. Simplifying the square root of 52,

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:15.012
we'll get d is equal to 2 times root 13. This is our simplified distance. And

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:18.252
again, notice that the horizontal distance is simply the change in the x

00:01:18.252 --> 00:01:24.344
values. We went from x equals negative 1 to x equals 3. And notice that the

00:01:24.344 --> 00:01:29.113
vertical distance was the change in the y values. We went from y equals 2 all

00:01:29.113 --> 00:01:34.179
the way up to y equals 8. So, we'll have the change in y squared, plus the

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.362
change in x squared equals d squared. We can use our algebra skills and

00:01:39.362 --> 00:01:41.080
eventually solve for d.
