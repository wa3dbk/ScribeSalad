00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.284
We need to divide distance by speed to find time. Let's look at this equation

00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:08.732
to figure out why. Time is in the denominator, so let's multiply both sides by

00:00:08.732 --> 00:00:14.500
time. Then we have that speed times time equals distance. Now we just need to

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.849
divide both sides by speed. And we get time equals distance over speed.
