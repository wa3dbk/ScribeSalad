00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.407
These lines are both written in the same form, even though we have different

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:08.917
variable names now than we normally do when we talk about slope intercept form.

00:00:09.018 --> 00:00:13.193
These equations are both in the same form as y equals m x plus b. We have a

00:00:13.205 --> 00:00:17.561
variable on one side, a constant times a variable, and then a constant term

00:00:17.573 --> 00:00:23.170
tacked on to the end. This is true for this equation as well. Becasue they are

00:00:23.182 --> 00:00:28.900
in slope intercept form, we can just read off their slopes from the equation

00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:34.813
directly. They do not have different slopes, they have the same slope. That's

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:39.175
what being parallel means after all. What changed we moved from the old

00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:44.106
situation to the new situation with the surplus solution was the g intercept. We

00:00:44.118 --> 00:00:48.629
can find that g intercept need equation in the slide where b normally is in

00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:53.492
slope intercept form. If I wanted to graph these pretty informally I may little

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:58.095
sketch up here, I would have our first line like this. In the second line,

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:02.613
exactly parallel to it, but just shifted up on the vertical axis. The

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:07.745
information we used to create the second equation then, came from us knowing the

00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:12.405
slope that this new line should have, and also one point that it should go

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:17.324
through, 0, 20 which we reflected in the g-intercept part of the equation.
