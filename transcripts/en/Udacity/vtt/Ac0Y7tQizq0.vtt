00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.960
Here, the solution was negative infinite to negative 3 or 1 half to positive

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.320
infinity. Nice algebra skills if you got these two integrals. To begin to solve

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.649
this quadratic inequality, we want to subtract 3 from both sides. So we have 0

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:19.614
on the left and the quadratic expression on the right. We can flip the entire

00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:26.170
inequality around, so we'll have 2y squared plus 5y minus 3 is greater than 0.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.035
These two statements here are exactly the same. They're just written in the

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:34.954
reverse order. Once we have this inequality, we want to find the 0s. If we find

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:40.000
the 0s, we can set up our number line with three intervals. So we'll factor the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.757
left-hand side of the equation to get 2y minus 1 times y plus 3. We set each

00:00:44.757 --> 00:00:50.592
factor equal to 0 and we solve for the values of y over here. In this case, y

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:55.229
could equal 1 half, and in this case, y could equal negative 3. We use positive

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.243
1 half and negative 3 to create the intervals on our number line. For interval

00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:05.348
I, we'll try the number y equals negative 5. When we substitute negative 5 in

00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:11.226
for y, we'll get the statement 22 is greater than 0. We know this is true, so

00:01:11.226 --> 00:01:16.258
this is included for our solution set. For interval II, we'll try the number y

00:01:16.258 --> 00:01:21.747
equals 0. When we plug in 0 for y, we'll be left with negative 3 greater than

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:26.403
0. We know this is not true, so any of these numbers within this region are not

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:31.180
part of our solution. And finally, for the third interval, we can try the

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.620
number y equals 1. When we plug in 1 for y, we'll get 4 greater than 0. This is

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.650
a true statement, so we can include these values as part of our solution set.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.544
We use parentheses at negative 3 and positive 1 half, since we need to be

00:01:45.544 --> 00:01:51.922
greater than 0, we can't be equal to it. So our final solution is negative

00:01:51.922 --> 00:01:56.370
infinity to negative 3 or 1 half to positive infinity.
