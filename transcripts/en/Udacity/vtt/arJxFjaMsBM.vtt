00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this and the following units, we will talk about probability.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Probability is just the opposite of statistics,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and there's a yin-yang relationship between both.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Put differently, in statistics we are given data

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and try to infer possible causes that relate to the data,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
whereas in probability we are given the description of the causes

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and we'd like to predict the data.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The reason why we now study probability and not statistics

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is because it gives us a language

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to describe the relationship between data and the underlying causes.

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, enough of the theory; let's dive in.
