00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
And the answer here is as follows--so first of all, it's important to notice that

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.660
a RAM that has the if-better function available is at least as powerful as a normal RAM

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.440
because all we're adding is this additional instruction

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.200
but we can still do anything that we could do before.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.810
So this here is clearly a check mark.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.660
Vertex cover, independent set, and clique would be solvable in exponential time.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.330
Also, if we have this if-better function available.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.910
And the second thing is that in the well sort of programming example that we just had

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.670
we also saw that the if-better function is so powerful that it will allow us to solve

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.300
vertex cover, independent set, and clique in polynomial time

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.660
if we have the if-better function available.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.820
And of course this one down here, that unfortunately has to stay blank

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.000
but not because we're sure that these problems, vertex cover, independent set, and clique

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.790
don't have a polynomial time algorithm but simply because we don't really know yet.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.310
We will come back to this matrix picture here in a minute.

00:00:56.310 --> 99:59:59.000
But let's turn our attention back to the RAM machine for a moment now.
