00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.450
All right.
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.900
Today what we're going to do is having
just started talking about Video.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.100
We're going to start talking about,
Action Recognition or

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.340
Activity Recognition in Video.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.910
That's the processing of video.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.330
For generating,
generating some sort of label or, or

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.150
descriptor that tells
you what's going on.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.680
So, there's a bit of a challenge in

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.020
activity recognition in
terms of terminology.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.088
And there's no sort of universally
accepted terminology, and

00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:32.093
I'll say some of this goes
back to the 70s, Hans Nagel,

00:00:32.093 --> 00:00:36.420
first started talking about events and
actions in history and things like that.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.070
So, loosely, we're going to use
the definitions that I have here.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.350
So, we talk about Events.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.290
And the one thing about an event
is it's a single moment in time.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.960
Right?
So

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.250
the moment a door closes or something
changes right, right in the imagery.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.980
A typically we refer
to that as an event.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.560
A little bit higher up perhaps thinking
is this basic idea of movements or

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.650
sometimes referred to as actions.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.720
And these are I'm going to describe a,
sort of atomic movement patterns.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.440
So you know, sitting down.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.310
Or you know, waving or
something like that.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.626
We've got a gesture-like, it's a,

00:01:13.626 --> 00:01:17.500
you could describe it as
a trajectory in some feature space.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.820
Whether it's the feature space of the
joints of the body or some appearance.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.200
It is it's a, it's a single thing.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.340
And then at the higher level there's
this notion called Activity.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.680
By the way the only reason it
says adopted from Venu and, and

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.280
myself not together I did the original
paper on movement activity and

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.890
action and it was wrong.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.590
I mean wrong in the sense of in,
in hindsight had activity followed

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.590
by actions because I was thinking
of actions being a big scale thing.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.710
And the field which like the paper for
a little while has sort of moved on and

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.550
we have this notion of, of movements.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.910
And then actions and
then relay activity.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.170
And activity is being sort of
composed of a series of actions or

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.310
a bunch of actions
happening at the same time.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.702
Typically if you're looking
at some interactions

00:02:03.702 --> 00:02:07.050
among the group of people that
we thought of as an activity.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.419
So one example.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.960
Here's a thing taken from
some surveillance, work.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.420
Some of this was shown at
the PETS conference let's see.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.660
Performance Evaluation of Tracking and
Surveillance,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.345
I think is what PETS stands for.

00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:22.570
There's been a lot of work lately on
just you know finding the person in

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.090
the image here and
have extracted them there.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.170
And maybe looking at some interactions
between people in a train station.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.140
The idea of basically being able to
watch an environment sometimes to be

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.850
able to inform authorities if
there's possible problem going on,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.640
sometimes to do things forensically.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.290
Right?
So something happened and

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.680
I'd like to look back over
the last eight hours of video and

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.210
find different kinds of things.
