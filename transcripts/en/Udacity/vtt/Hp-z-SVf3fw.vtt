00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. Let's play with some of these substitutions, in practice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All right, here we are, back in that simple text file--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the play HTML file I was playing with before--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we're going to use this because it's a little bit quicker

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to demonstrate what I'd like to talk about.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So I'm going to enter some text.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So I've typed in some text; I Save it this and I load this in my browser.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Okay. So here we are; I've loaded this text in my browser

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and, if you remember--if I just type in plain text in an HTML file,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
it just shows up as plain text in the browser.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Okay. Now I'm going to surround this tag with angled brackets

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and let's see how this renders in our browser.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
When I Reload my browser,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that word, html, disappeared.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That's because, when I put angled brackets around it,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
it turned into a tag, and tags don't render an HTML.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
They turn into tags.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So if we use the Escaping we just learned

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and I replace this Less Than symbol with our Escape,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
which is: &lt;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and I replace the Greater Than with: &gt;

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and I Reload this in my browser, what we see is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the actual text that we wanted to demonstrate--

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which is the actual angled brackets.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So let's try another quick example of this.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If I were to change the string, html,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to the letter, "b",

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and Save this and Reload this in my browser,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we now have the <b>tag.</b>

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And if I were to go back to my Editor and change

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
these Less Than's and Greater Than's

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
back into the actual &lt; and &gt;,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and Reload this in my browser,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
our text turns to bold.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So if we don't want our HTML to behave as HTML, we need to Escape it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And if we want it to behave as HTML--we don't Escape it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
All right. Try some Escaping on your own.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So what is the correct way to include the text:

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
&amp; = &amp; in rendered HTML?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So it should look like this once it's rendered in the browser.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.723
What do we need to include in the HTML to get that ?
