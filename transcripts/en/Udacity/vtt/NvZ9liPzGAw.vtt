00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.199
So I think there's two things that are true here. The first one is polynomial time,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.632
because we're trying to do pre-processing for problems that normally require exponential time.

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:13.766
So if we don't have this requirement here, you could use pre-processing to already solve the problem,

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:18.966
because then you would have exponential time. And that really wouldn't make any sense.

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:25.232
Of course, in practice it could make sense to have certain exponential time pre-processing algorithms where,

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.599
for example, the base of the exponent is much smaller than of the general algorithm.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.332
But actually I've never seen that done. And right now, for us, polynomial time is a good requirement to have.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:40.699
Speeding up worse-case running time is, in my opinion, not a requirement for pre-processing.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.466
Of course, you would like to get a speed-up, but on the other hand, as you've seen, the pre-processing rules are very simple.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:50.899
So, we might always encounter instances where pre-processing does not apply.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.766
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. Pre-processing runs in polynomial time, so it's easy to do.

00:00:55.767 --> 00:01:00.332
So we should just hope that pre-processing helps us, but not make it a requirement.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:06.599
And finally, that is of course very important. Pre-processing must not affect the solution that we get in the end.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.132
If we have a decision problem where the answer is yes or no, after pre-processing, we want the answer to be the same, of course.

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:18.966
And the same is for optimization problems. If the answer is 10, 11 or 12, then after pre-processing,

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:25.099
the answer should remain 10, 11 or 12. Because otherwise, pre-processing would actually alter the problem,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.667
and it would alter the solution to that problem, which of course is something we do not want.
