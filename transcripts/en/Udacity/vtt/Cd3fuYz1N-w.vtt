00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.560
For modular multiplication,
the story is a bit more complicated.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.369
First, similar to modular
addition,in modular multiplication

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:16.293
the result of x times y not m is
the remainder of x times y divided by m.

00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:18.760
In modular multiplication,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.501
the result of a number times
its inverse, MOD M, is one.

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:29.072
For example, if the modular is 10,
then three and seven are inverse

00:00:29.072 --> 00:00:35.220
of each other because three times
seven is 21 and 21 MOD 10 is one.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.060
Because, the remainder of
21 divided by 10 is one.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.460
It turns out, that, for a given modular,
only some numbers have inverse.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.126
For example, if the modular is 10,
then the numbers two,

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:52.710
five, six, eight do not have inverse.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.680
For example, for the number two,
can you find its inverse,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.150
say x, such that two times x,
MOD 10 is one?

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.020
There's no such x.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.120
The great mathematician Euclid invented
the method to find multiplicative

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.890
inverse.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.640
That is, for the modular n given X,
Euclid had an algorithm to find Y.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.940
Such that X times Y mod N equal to one.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.920
Euclid also proved that only
the numbers relatively prime to N

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.380
has MOD N multiplicative inverse.
