00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:05.599
And the way that we're going to prove that the halting problem is undecideable is by using a technique

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.899
known as a proof by contradiction, which means that I will first assume that the halting problem is, in fact, decideable,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.766
and then show you that this assumption leads to an unresolvable contradiction.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.999
So let's start out by assuming that the halting problem is, in fact, decideable.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.999
So it follows directly from the assumption that the halting problem is decide-able that there must be some algorithm

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.232
for the halting problem. Now, this algorithm can be very sophisticated, very complicated, whatsoever.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:37.899
But since the halting problem is decideable, or since we assume that the halting problem is decideable,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.666
we can directly conclude from this assumption that there must be some algorithm solving it,

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.299
no matter what the program, no matter what the input.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.632
So now that we assume that we have this halt algorithm, what we're now going to do is something sneaky,

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:55.666
and this will lead us to the proof by contradiction. We're going to write a program that uses this algorithm here,

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.699
and this program I call inverse halt, and it's defined as following:

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.999
So inverse halt takes as input a program, so not a program and input, but just a program,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.032
and then it calls the halt algorithm with two inputs. So the first input is, again, the program, just as in halt,

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:17.466
but it also gives the program source code itself, if you will, as an input to halt.

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:24.266
So it's basically the question of what happens if I give a program its own program code as an input?

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:31.132
And the way this then reacts is the following: If halt says the program when it's fed its own code, it will stop.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.966
Then inverse halt, that's why I call it inverse halt, will go into an infinite loop.

00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:43.399
So if program stops on being fed itself, then inverse halt of that program will not stop. It will not halt.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.899
If, on the other hand, halt determines that program, given itself as an input, would not stop, so go into an infinite loop,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.766
then this whole program here, inverse halt, would in fact terminate. And we're guaranteed in this case that the overall program,

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:01.966
inverse halt, will terminate, because we know that halt is guaranteed to terminate.

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:07.232
After all, it's a valid algorithm that solves the halting program for any program and any input.

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:12.532
Now we're almost there; there's just one more step missing to arrive at our proof by contradiction.

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:17.866
And that is that we now run the following program: So we're almost ready to have proof by contradiction,

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:22.099
and to actually conclude the proof, we'll now consider the following program:

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.499
We run inverse halt with inverse halt as an input. So it's kinda similar to up here.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.899
We consider inverse halt in two ways: This one up here is the program inverse halt that we actually run,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.332
and this here is inverse halt, if you will, it's the source code of inverse halt that we want to analyze.

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:43.899
So it's similar to up here again. We're considering a program both as an actual algorithm,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.499
but also the description of that algorithm. And what we're now going to show is that inverse halt,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.232
when given inverse halt as an input, is going to basically choke on itself.

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.633
And of course, we're going to do this as a quiz.
