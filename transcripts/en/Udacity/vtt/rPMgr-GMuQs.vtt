00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.850
Let's check our knowledge
of direct-mapped caches and

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.380
how they handle conflicts.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.584
Let's consider a 16 kilobyte
direct-mapped cache with

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:10.274
256-byte blocks.

00:00:10.274 --> 00:00:16.860
The question is, which of these
addresses conflict with 1234567 hex?

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.130
The first choice is 12345677.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.300
The next choice is 11335577.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.954
The next choice is 11115678.

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:32.130
And the last choice is 12341666.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.170
So which of these will
conflict with this address

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.141
in a 16 kilobyte direct-mapped
cache with 256-byte blocks?
