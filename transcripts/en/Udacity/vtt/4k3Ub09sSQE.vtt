00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:03.657
So if you could sort and scan, and more importantly understand the kinds of

00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:08.179
algorithms that we study in using sort and scan and why they're good and bad for the GPU,

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.049
you are in fine shape. The ideas you've learned will carry over to many other algorithms.

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.553
You'll be using these techniques in the assignment this week

00:00:15.553 --> 00:00:19.073
where you'll do automatic red-eye removal using template matching.

00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:24.258
This algorithm relies on sorting a vector by key which indirectly relies on scan,

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:28.000
so go apply your new found knowledge to the assignment.
