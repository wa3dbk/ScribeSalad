Now that we've tried a number problem, let's try a geometry problem. Here we

00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:07.768
have the width of a rectangle is 9 inches less than its length. If the perimeter

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.560
of the rectangle is 58 inches, find the dimensions. You can put one dimension

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:12.904
here and one dimension here.
