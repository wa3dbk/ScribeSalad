00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So the answer is: it prints out the numbers, from 1 to 10.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And if we follow through the code, we can see why.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So initially, the value of "i" is zero.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The test says, well "i" is not equal to 10,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so zero is not equal to 10--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
so we go through the Block,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the Block adds 1 to "i".

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So that will change the value of "i".

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now "i" refers to "1".

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And then the next statement prints the value of "i".

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The value of "i" now is 1, so it will print, "1".

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And then, because it's a while, we go back.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We do the test again--I'm not going to step through every time, so we keep doing this.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
As "i" gets bigger, we're going to keep going.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Eventually--let's say "i" is 9,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and by the time "i" is 9--well, after "i" was 9--we print "9".

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So we've printed the numbers from 1 through 9.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
At this point, "i" is still not equal to 10,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
so we still go through the loop body.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now we add 1 to "i"--that will make the value of "i" 10.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Then we do the print, so that will print out, "10".

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Then we go back to the "while" test.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now the value of "i" is 10, so: "i" not equal to 10--"10" not equal to 10--

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is False, because 10 does equal 10.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That means we're done with the "while" loop

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and we're going to continue,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but there's nothing to continue with, so we're done.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So the net result of the code is printing the numbers from 1 to 10

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and that's all that happens.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So now the test is False.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We don't execute the Block anymore, we would continue with the next statement.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
There isn't one, so we're done

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and what the code did was print out the numbers from 1 to 10.
