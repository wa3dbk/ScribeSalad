00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.115
Dividing both sides by 3 gives us x is greater than or equal to 4. Let's check

00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:07.764
this on a number line. Here is what this inequality should look like on the

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:11.517
number line. The number line is thus divided into two regions. There's one

00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:15.448
region over here on the left of values that x is not allowed to equal. And then

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:19.288
the region on the right of the number line, that's all the values that x is

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:24.655
allowed to equal take on. Let's pick one value from each, and see if they verify

00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:30.174
our solution. First, I'll pick a value of x that should work in the original

00:00:30.174 --> 00:00:36.150
inequality. Maybe, 6. 3 times 6 is equal to 18. And, yes, 18 is greater than or

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.759
equal to 12. So that works. Now let's check a value from the left side, the area

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:46.433
that's not shaded in. So when I plug in a value from over her to the original

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:50.913
inequality, I should not make this true. A value from over here should not

00:00:50.913 --> 00:00:55.393
satisfy this. Let's pick 0. 3 times 0 is equal to 0, and 0 is not greater than

00:00:55.393 --> 00:00:58.537
or equal to 12, so this also confirms our solution.
