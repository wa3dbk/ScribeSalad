00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And that is why you could think of hardness,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
meaning how hard is a specific input to solve as a combination of 2 things.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One is, I think, the size of the input,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and we always measure this as a number N.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But the other thing is the structure of the input.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In a way, it's not larger instances are harder to solve,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but in a way you could say, harder instances are harder to solve.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This of course might seem like a bit nitpicking around,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so the question is, is this actually useful, and the answer is yes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For some problems, you can actually express the structure of the input,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and I'm soon going to show you how to do that, as a number K.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And while in classical NP-completeness,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
so to say, you would measure hardness as some function of N.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You can then measure hardness as a function of 2 parameters.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
One parameter is still the size of the input,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the other parameter is going to specify

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
something about the structure of the input.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now this might sound a bit abstract,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so what could this parameter be?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And I'm going to show you 2 possibilities for this parameter,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and we're going to discuss them in detail.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
One is size of the solution,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and the other one is something I would call distance from triviality.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So for example, for the network from the last quiz,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
you could actually see that both parameters could tell us

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that finding a solution here is easy,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because first of all, the solution here and optimum vertex cover is very small,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
you only require 1 vertex.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And also, you could argue that this graph here is very trivial

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
because all you need is a pre-processing rule

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
to actually find the best possible solution.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But again, we'll get into more detail.

00:01:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's start out with the size of the solution.
