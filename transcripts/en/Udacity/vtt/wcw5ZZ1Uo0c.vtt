00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.670
Let us return to our problem from the intelligence test to see how generate and

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.940
test might apply as a problem solving method. Again, here is a problem that

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.580
we encountered earlier. Notice that this is a more complicated problem

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.700
than the guards and prisoners problem. Here is why. In case of the guards and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.570
prisoner problem, each transformation from one state to another,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.842
was a discrete transformation. One could take a certain number of guards to

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:32.380
the other side. One could take a certain number of prisoners to the other side,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.020
or one could take a certain of number of guards and prisoners to the other side.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.950
In this case, if I look at the approximation between A and B,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.730
and I notice that the diamond inside the circle is now outside the circle and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.350
is larger. Now suppose I were to try the same transformation from C

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.090
to D. So I can look at the circle inside the triangle,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.300
put it outside, and also make it larger. I notice that when I put it outside,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.420
I can put it outside right next to the triangle, a little bit farther,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.680
a little bit farther, a little bit farther away. I can make it the same size, or

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.869
a little larger, or a lot larger. Increase its size by 50% or 51% or 52%.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.380
So this space of possibilities here is very large. So for problems of this kind,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.650
the need for a smarter generator and a smarter tester is critical,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.530
because this space of possibilities can become very large, very quickly.
