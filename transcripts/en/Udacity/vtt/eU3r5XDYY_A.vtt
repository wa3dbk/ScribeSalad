00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.385
But what can we do for an equation like this? Notice that these two bases are

00:00:04.385 --> 00:00:11.222
different. We have 16 raised to the x power. And 4 raised to the 3rd power. The

00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:16.254
16 and the 4 are different bases. So, for an equation like this, we want to try

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:21.390
and get the bases to match. We want them to be equal. So, we can rewrite 16

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.526
with a base of 4. We'll have 4 squared which is 16 raised to the x. And the

00:00:28.526 --> 00:00:32.398
right hand side will stay the same. We know by the properties of exponents when

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:36.661
we raise a power to a power, we multiply these powers together. This means

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:42.962
we'll have four raised to the 2 x, equal to 4 cubed. Now, since both of the

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:48.705
bases are equal, we can set 2x equal to 3. These exponents must be equal to one

00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:54.148
another. And finally, we divide both sides by 2 to get one x is equal to three

00:00:54.148 --> 00:01:01.290
halves. Now, this value for x should make sense in our original equation. We'll

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.648
have 16 raised to the three halves here. And we'll have 4 cubed on the right

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:10.740
hand side of our equation. We know that a fractional exponent really represents

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.635
a root. So, this really says that we have the square root of 16 raised to the

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:22.195
3rd power. We know the square root of 16 equals 4. So we'll have four cubed

00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:28.846
equal to 4 cubed, so yes, this checks. You try solving this equation. Try

00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:32.628
rewriting these bases so that way they're the same, and then see if you can

00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:34.440
solve for x.
