00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
A couple of mistakes—right on tactics—I just want to remind you about.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I mentioned them earlier, but a common startup error on day one

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is let's price on cost.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We know how much it takes to build our product.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We'll just add a markup that is a profit,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and therefore we have a price.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
How hard can that be?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is typically not a strategic way to price.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You might end up here, but boy there's a lot more moves on the table.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What you really want to think about is not just your internal economics,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but the customer insight that you actually have.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I want you do think about, yes, pricing on cost is maybe the first place we start,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but are we leaving a ton of money on the table?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Because the alternative to pricing on cost is pricing on value.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
As we said earlier, you know now your customer segment's perception

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
of the value of your value prop.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Is it about time saved? New efficiency created?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Remember we talked earlier about pains and gains for this customer segment.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What is it that they value?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Why are you saving them a ton of money?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now, customers don't necessarily feel that they want to pay this way,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but smart marketeers and smart startup executivies

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
can convince customers that instead of paying on cost

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
they really ought to be thinking about that your company is unique

00:01:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and providing the most value—not just the cheapest product.
