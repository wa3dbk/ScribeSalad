There is a simple way to get access

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.740
to the camera and the audio input, the capture

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.570
extension on the accept attribute on the file input

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.850
element in HTML. This will give you a button

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.550
that opens up the system camera or Audio recorder

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.160
app on a mobile device. However there are some

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.360
issues with this approach. Can you think of some

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.900
problems with this approach to camera and audio input?
