00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now apply the Forward Euler Method to the following situation:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We drill a big hole and let a mouse fall into that hole.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The mouse starts at height 0 and at velocity 0.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The height is going to be our x-coordinate.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That means that x(0) = 0.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:29.000
V(0) = 0, and a(t) = f/m = -9.81 m/s2--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
minus because the velocity is going to become negative.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Your job is to provide the appropriate code to

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
compute the t and x and v values

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
for all steps.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We create these arrays with 51 entries

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so that the entry number 0 can be the initial value,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and you compute 50 additional values for each array.
