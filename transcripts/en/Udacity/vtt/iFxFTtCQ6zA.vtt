00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.580
The best way to improve your pitch,
is practice.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.120
And after you finish practice,
you practice some more.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.500
So it really starts with other
entrepreneur friends of yours.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.850
Maybe it's your co-founders, maybe it's
people that raise money from investors.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.280
Other friendly investors you might
know that maybe are not right for

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.310
a business, that are willing
to help you with your pitch.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.930
It's about practicing and
practicing and practicing.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.020
Sometimes, it's you go to pitch
competitions that's also a good way to

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.980
practice but

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.460
the more you say your story,
the better it will become over time.
