00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.260
All right.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.670
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.890
Last time, we introduced principal
component analysis as a way of doing

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.920
dimensionality reduction,
going from a high space to a low space.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.570
And we said it only works
if the signal actually is

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.478
present in that lower dimensional space.

00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:16.590
In particular,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.500
you can only reconstruct an image well
using a small number of low dimensional.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.945
A low dimensional small
number of basis images or

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:28.660
eigenvectors if the image itself
was kind of like that, right?

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.210
I can only make faces out of eigenfaces,
I can't make bicycles or tortilla chips.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.490
So that gave us a little insight, as you
might use that to do detection, right?

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.150
So if I want to find a face, I might
look for patches that can be well

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.850
described, reconstructed,
using just that low dimension.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.450
So, there's a related task that
we can use this method for.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.210
And that's what's called appearance
based tracking all right?

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.220
So here's the basic idea,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.430
learn something about
what a target looks like.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.140
Maybe not just a single image but
the possible variations

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.350
by capturing a low-dimensional space,
being able to reconstruct.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.170
And then you're going to
track that target around

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.310
by finding the place that you can
reconstruct the best, all right?

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.500
So that's the basic idea and

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.560
what's cool about this is instead of
like some of the previous tracking.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.100
Where if you learn new appearance
every time step, you might drift

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.730
that is you eventually get stuck on
something that's not the object.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.390
Here you might be more robust to that.
