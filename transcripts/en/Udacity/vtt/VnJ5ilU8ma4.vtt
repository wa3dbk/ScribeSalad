00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer to that question is no.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Actually, the opposite is true.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The more thoroughly a piece of code is tested,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the more bugs it is likely to have.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The story goes the other way around.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Good managers have a good intuition of where the bugs are,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then when deciding on where and how to test

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
they go for the locations where most bugs would be suspected.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Therefore, in a program like Firefox for instance,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
there is lots and lots of testing that's being done for JavaScript, for instance.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Therefore, this has high coverage,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but still many, many bugs are left because testing apparently can't find all the bugs.
