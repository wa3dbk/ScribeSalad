00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.380
Okay, so I've gone ahead and pulled up a meme of myself.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.660
And let's analyze the way this text is drawn.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.860
Memes tend to use white text that is outlined in black.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.810
This makes it easy to read the text no matter what background it's over.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.820
So in this case, the like here is on top of a light background, but

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.110
we can read it really easily because of the black outline.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.510
And then down here, over my dark shirt because the letters have

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.270
white fills inside they're easily legible there too.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.970
So this is a nice strategy for making sure that text is always legible.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.410
The way this is accomplished is with a mix of fill and stroke text.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.470
To the scripts I've added this method, stroke text.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.500
Which is going to draw the string hello udacity.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.540
And it's going to put it at the point 50, 10.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.320
Now, note here that this 50 is going to be,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.320
in the case of this text, the lower left-hand corner of the text.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.971
So, if this were 0,

00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:56.970
0 we wouldn't be able to see the text because the lower left-hand corner

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.780
would be at zero and the rest of the text wouldn't be above the page.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.630
So that's just something to know.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.930
Let's go ahead and see what happens when we call this method.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.170
Come over here and hit Refresh.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.605
And we can see that we now have a hello udacity written in

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:14.326
the same green color that we set earlier drawn at the position 50, 10.

00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:18.450
This string here could be any string and we can use JavaScript to set it.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.110
We could also use fillText instead.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.570
I'll go ahead and save that.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.030
Now we've got fillText.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.730
I'll come over here and hit refresh, and

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.110
we've got hello udacity written in the same blue color that we set here.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.450
In addition to letting us decide what strings to draw on the page and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.310
where to draw them, the Canvas 2D context allows us to set a lot of

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.890
other options, like for instance, font size, font style, and line width.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.660
Check the instructor notes for more information.
