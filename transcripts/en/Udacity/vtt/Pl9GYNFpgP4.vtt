00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.830
I think one of the great thing
about startups is that it

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.540
puts a great big hurdle in
front of future employees.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.270
It tells them look,
if you want to work here,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.336
you're going to take a huge salary cut.

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:17.300
Yes, you get equity, but you're going to
sacrifice a lot with the potential for

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.440
amazing rewards but
it's just the potential.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.360
That high bar usually attracts,
potentially,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.940
those employees you want to to hire.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.980
You want to to make sure you don't
try to compete with salaries,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.690
often you can't.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.170
You want to make sure that you
compete with your company's vision.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.230
You want to compete with the culture,
you want to compete with what it is that

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.870
the company does that no other company
in the world can offer because you're

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.150
doing this unique thing that will have
a significant impact on people's lives.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.620
Selling the vision is your
number one tool to recruit and

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.730
the good news is it's aligned with
finding those amazing employees that can

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.290
really change your
company in the future.
