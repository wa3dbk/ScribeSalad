00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.460
Returning once again to our,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.150
our window diagram. Now let's look at the third compartment, this is the one for

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.950
operations. Once again, there's optional visibility, using the same symbols we

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.200
had before. There's the name. There may be a return type,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.520
if the operation returns some value. It's not shown in, in these particular

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.710
examples. Then there's a list of parameters. Just like you would have,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.700
if you were describing some method within an object oriented language.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.810
The parameter list includes a name of the parameter. It's type. You

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.420
may express a default value. And you may also indicate, whether the particular.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.060
Parameter, is an input parameter, an output parameter or an in,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.370
out parameter. In, out parameters are those in which the value can come in,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.800
and a different value can be returned. Those kinds of param adjectives in,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.390
out and in out are not shown in this particular example. In addition to

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.550
the parameters in the operations section, you can give some properties. Some of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.390
those properties are expressed within the braces, like we've seen before. For

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.310
example, you can indicate that a particular operation is a query operation.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.910
That is, it's only providing information about some existing attributes

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.190
that in, within the class. You can, there's, there's, properties to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.690
describing concurrency. there's, there's properties describing whether or

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.230
not this particular operation is abstract, as would be

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.960
seen in an abstract method in obscuring language. And you can also show,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.330
that a particular operation has Class Scope. That's shown by an underline on

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.380
the operation name, and what class scope means, is that it's not a operation

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.730
of particular instance, but a operation for the class as a whole.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.900
For example, let's say you wanted to know how many instances of vehicles,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.000
you had already instantiated. You can't query any particular instance and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.140
ask it about other instances. Instead you query the class, using

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.710
a Class Scoped operation, and the class

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.760
if you've implemented things correctly can provide the answer back to you.
