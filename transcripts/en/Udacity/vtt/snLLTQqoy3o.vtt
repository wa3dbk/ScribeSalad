00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.260
So let’s go fix my page. Now the first thing

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.420
we need to do in order to make a mobile friendly

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.110
page, is to set the viewport. The mobile browser needs to

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.460
know that this webpage knows how to format itself on devices

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.960
with varying width. It doesn’t need the mobile browser to pretend

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.420
that it’s a desktop screen with a given width. Once you

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.780
set the viewport correctly, it will be able to resize properly

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.950
and lay out properly. So what should my viewport meta say?
