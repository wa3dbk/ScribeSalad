00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.368
Continuing along the same vein, let's play around with another similar problem.

00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:08.501
This time, can you tell me what the solutions to x to the fourth equals 1 are?

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:12.724
I'll remind you that we saw earlier that i to the fourth equals 1. So that gives

00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:16.785
you one answer. And also tell you that there are several that belong in this

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:21.045
box. Think really carefully about what these could be, and seperate your answers

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:23.291
with commas once you've figured them out.
