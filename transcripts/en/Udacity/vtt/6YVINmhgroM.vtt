00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.637
I've been at Venmo for two years,
and for the first 22 months,

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.772
at Venmo, I was on the iOS team and

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:10.760
I built a large part of the Apple
that exists currently today.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.716
And now I'm on the strategy team,

00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:17.045
we're focused on exploring different
monetization strategies at Venmo.

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:20.926
The Venmo iOS team decided to
rewrite the Venmo app in Swift.

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:25.702
Around the same time as WWGC 2015,
Swift 2 was just announced and we were

00:00:25.702 --> 00:00:30.272
watching all these videos about all
the cool things you can do with Swift.

00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:35.240
At the same time, quintessentially,
our product design teams were discussing

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.280
new UIs and new UXs and
in the Venmo app.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.595
Also, at the same time, our existing
Objective-C.code base was becoming very

00:00:42.595 --> 00:00:46.700
unmaintainable, building new
features was taking a long time.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.520
If we ever wanted to do any design
changes to the app or different

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.120
flows in the app, it would require
massive refactors because of the fact

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.360
that our UI layers and our model
layers are so deeply coupled together.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.059
So, one day after the one
of the WWDC sessions,

00:01:06.059 --> 00:01:09.555
all of us came back to
the San Francisco office and

00:01:09.555 --> 00:01:15.282
just started whiteboarding what of Swift
version of the Venmo app looked like.

00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:20.350
We made an API layer,
we made a UI layer and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.090
we just opened up our computers and
started building it.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.750
This wasn't like an official project or
anything but

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.930
we started we kept doing this for
about a week and a half and

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.606
came up with a bare bones
version of the Venmo app.

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:35.472
kind of just like an experiment to see
how a Swift only version of Venmo app

00:01:35.472 --> 00:01:39.467
feels, and how much faster we think we
can iterate on a version like this as

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:41.813
opposed to the current
version of the app.

00:01:41.813 --> 00:01:44.271
We got to a very good point
in those two weeks, and

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:48.870
finally told what we were working on and

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.426
how this code base that's going to
maintainable for a very long time.

00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:58.480
And it's also going to enable us to
write features much faster, and because

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.089
of all that, they decided to get on
board and we started building this app.

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:06.670
Objective-C will stick around for
a very, very, very long time.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.660
All of you like it,
the foundation and I think all of

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.261
Apple's frameworks are actually
written in the 100% Objective-C.

00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:16.070
I don't think Objective-C is going
anywhere for an extremely long time and

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.440
I think that having some knowledge about
how it works is extremely important.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.740
I do think that as time goes on,
more and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.910
more Objective-C developers will be
writing Swift more and more often.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.640
A lot of existing companies that

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.560
have 100% Objective-C apps will
start catching the Swift train and

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.060
start building all their new features
in Swift, which I highly recommend.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.987
What I don't recommend is just rewriting
an app, a perfectly good app and

00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:48.110
in Objective-C and
Swift because it's going to be a very,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.540
very, very long project
with very little gain.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.600
One of the largest challenge of doing a
big rewrite is the fact that during that

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.320
time of the rewrite, your team can't
really build new product features and

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.600
if you are building new product
features, you have to build it twice.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.746
Once in the existing app,
as well as like in the new app.

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:12.660
The nice thing is that when you build
it twice, you can actually see how much

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.170
faster you're building it in a new app,
which is quite delightful and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.620
kind of proves your point to the rest of
the team that this is a good decision.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.128
But that was definitely the most
difficult part about doing this rewrite,

00:03:25.128 --> 00:03:30.550
but when we were being conservative on
new features in the app during this time

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.410
and the ones that absolutely had to
get in, had to be written full times.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.600
We're still working on it today,
it's almost done.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.459
The scope of the app is also changed
a lot since we first started.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.662
That said,
the entire team is working on it.

00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:50.290
And whenever some project does come up,
like a product feature that needs

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.670
to come out,
one of us will move off the core app,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.480
rewrite app and start working on that
project and then work on it twice.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.150
Once for the old app and
once for the new app.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.680
If we were hiring a new
developer at Venmo who

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.420
primarily will be writing Swift, I
think that them having some Objective-C

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.260
knowledge coming in to Venmo
would be really valuable to us.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.690
It would also differentiate
them from other candidates

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.010
that might only also know Swift,
which is really important.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.772
Though our entire code
base will be 100% Swift,

00:04:26.772 --> 00:04:30.660
we do have a lot of dependencies
that are Objective-C, and

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.342
sometimes you do have to go
into them and maintain them.

00:04:34.342 --> 00:04:38.438
We would want them to know
the syntax of Objective-C primarily,

00:04:38.438 --> 00:04:41.421
as well as some of
the nuances of Objective-C.

00:04:41.421 --> 00:04:46.245
For example, Objective-C variables
are by default always optional.

00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:50.970
That means that opens you up to a lot
of errors and runtime bugs which

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.790
you don't have in Swift, and so it's
important to be even more careful, and

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.800
check for nil before you're adding
a variable into a dictionary.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.860
A lot of our third party dependencies
are still in Objective-C,

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.980
some of which we have
open source ourselves.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.600
So going back into those dependencies
and updating things is important.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.170
Knowing basic Objective-C
syntax is very important.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.640
Knowing how to do anullability on it
to make sure that your Swift code

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.690
plays nice with Objective-C
is also very important.
