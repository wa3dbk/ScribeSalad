00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Andy] This lesson is on list comprehensions.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is something that wasn't covered in CS101 but will be used in many future classes,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
including CS212.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
List comprehensions are a powerful tool for quickly and concisely creating lists.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For example, let's say you have a list of the Udacity TAs like this,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and maybe we'll want to write the TA names in uppercase

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because lowercase is a little bit boring.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
One way we can do this is with a for loop like this one. And let's see how it works.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This for loop is really doing 5 different things.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
First we create the empty list bad<u>uppercase</u>tas,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and I've called it bad<u>uppercase</u>tas

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to emphasize that this really isn't the way we're going to want to create such a list.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Next it generates the indices, and it does that here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
These indices will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 because udacity_tas is a list of length 6.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Then we iterate over these indices.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Next we apply the upper function, and this is a function that just takes a string

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and converts all of the characters to uppercase.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Finally, we append to the bad<u>uppercase</u>tas list.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And this code will be perfectly functional, but it is bad, it is ugly, and it is slow,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which is why we have list comprehensions.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And just to show that this code works, let's run it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And sure enough, we get a list of the TA names, and they are printed in uppercase.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Using list comprehensions we could solve this problem in 1 line of code.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And here Python recognizes that udacity_tas is an iterable.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Iterable just means any object that can be iterated over.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So for example, lists can be iterated over, strings can--and you'll see a lot of that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in CS212 in the first unit--tuples--and if you don't know what those are yet, don't worry.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
These are all iterable objects, and this notation tells Python

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to iterate over all of the entries in udacity_tas, call each entry name,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and then apply this upper function to name.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The brackets indicate that we want to put the results into a list,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and that's the list that we see down here:

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Peter, Andy, Sarah, Gundega, Job, Sean.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And actually, I'd rather print each name on its own line, so let's do that like this.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
That's better.
