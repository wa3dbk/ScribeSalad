00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.810
When we go through the steps of long division, we end up with x squared minus x

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.489
plus 1 as our answer. Again, this matches a rule that we learned earlier when

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:13.721
we were factoring. We learned that x cube plus 1 is equal to x plus 1 times x

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:18.229
squared minus x plus 1. And that's exactly what you found here. All we're doing

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:22.440
this time is dividing both sides of this equation by x plus 1. That's pretty

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.440
cool.
