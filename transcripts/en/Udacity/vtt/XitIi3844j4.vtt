00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.328
Let's take a couple [of] minutes to look at the solutions.

00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:11.288
When we're looking at the slope of line 'uc,' you can see that our slope works out to be 3/5.

00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:15.073
Finding the perpendicular slope is then relatively easy.

00:00:15.073 --> 00:00:20.788
We find the inverse of the slope, which is negative 5/3.

00:00:20.788 --> 00:00:23.700
Now it's time to find the equation of this line.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.367
Let's first recall our midpoint, 3/2 and 9/2, and our perpendicular slope, which is negative 5/3.

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:36.489
Please insert those values into the point-slope form and solve.

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:43.647
And our equation in slope intercept form is y = -5/3 x + 7.
