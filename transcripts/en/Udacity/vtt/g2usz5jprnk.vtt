Now, that we're more familiar with the concept of domain, let's look a little

00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:09.030
bit more closely at this graph. Our initial function for the area of Grant's fun

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.422
room as a function of half of its width was A of x equals 4x squared plus 6x.

00:00:14.422 --> 00:00:18.568
And we said that our domain is x is greater than 0. Now, what do you think then

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:22.825
the range values will be? We'll write this in inequality notation as well. And

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:27.325
I've already written in A of x for you, so all you need to fill in, in this box

00:00:27.325 --> 00:00:30.102
is some sort of inequality sign and a number.
