00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.378
So now that we have this equation for the
total amount of money that Grant's going

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:06.871
to make from people who bought his
products the first day and the second day,

00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:10.942
it would be great if we could simplify it
further, however we don't know how to do

00:00:10.942 --> 00:00:14.723
that yet. So, before we dive into this
particular example, let's look at a

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:18.960
slightly less complicated but similar
problem. Let's say we just have some

00:00:18.972 --> 00:00:26.325
expression. I picked 3x - 5y + 6x + 9y.
Now how can we simplify this expression?

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:31.296
Well, I think we need to remember what
each of these terms really means. So 3x

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:40.095
for example is actually equal to x + x + x
and 6x is actually equal to 6 x's added

00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:43.763
together. Right now, writing this out
might not seem particularly helpful. But I

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:47.991
think the reason that I chose to write
these terms this way will becomes clear if

00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:52.244
we just rearrange the order of the terms
in this expression. So now we switch the

00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:56.207
order of the terms around so that terms
with x are next to each other and the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.221
terms of y are next to each other. Now we
can see that the first thing we want to do

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:05.047
is add 3x and 6x together. With all of the
x's written out, that doesn't seem that

00:01:05.047 --> 00:01:08.778
hard. I just need to figure out how many
x's, total I have down here. And if I

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:15.226
count them I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 9 x's. So I guess that means that 3x +

00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:21.260
6x = 9x. Now, one thing we can notice is
that, in order to get the sum of 3x and 6x

00:01:21.272 --> 00:01:25.973
here We don't actually have to count all
the x's. All we really have to do is add

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:31.468
the coefficients of the variables
together, since 3 + 6 = 9. Once we have

00:01:31.468 --> 00:01:35.719
the coefficient, we just make sure that we
multiply that by the variable that both of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.201
these terms have. We usually call this
adding like terms, or combining like

00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:42.421
terms, as I've written at the top of the slide.
