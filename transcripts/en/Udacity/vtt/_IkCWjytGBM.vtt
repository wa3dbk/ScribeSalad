00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.930
We talked about a whole bunch of things
that we think should be private.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.320
We should be able to exercise control
over who can learn about them and

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.110
who can use that information.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.810
But there are other things
that are clearly not private.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.900
For example, where I live, my address.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.520
You buy a house,
there's some that's recorded,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.330
the deed is recorded, and
by your local government or whoever.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.600
And anyone can go see that
book where that's done.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.800
Am I registered to vote in the US?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.570
This information is public.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.960
You don't have the right to say,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.330
it shouldn't be collected or
shared with anyone else.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.250
And some more surprising
things may not be public.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.120
I, as a professor at Georgia Tech,
which is a public university,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.370
my salary is public because
the state of Georgia said so.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.090
Actually, this is a good point.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.500
The context is extremely
important as well.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.170
So, we talked about communication,
emails.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.290
Well, as the employees of the state of
Georgia, we're subject to, Georgia Tech

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.650
is subject to, it's a public university,
subject to open records requests.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.740
The other side of privacy we're
going to see is your ability

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.658
to access information,
so privacy limits it.

00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:17.636
So, there is certainly sort of
trade-off, and what you and

00:01:17.636 --> 00:01:18.884
I view as private.

00:01:18.884 --> 00:01:22.956
Some things are clearly private versus
non-private, but obviously in other

00:01:22.956 --> 00:01:26.411
cases, we may have different
opinions and those opinions may have

00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:30.440
been formed by who we are, our cultural
backgrounds, and things like that.
