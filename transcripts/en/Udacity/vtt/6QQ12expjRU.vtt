00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.782
So, you might have noticed that x^2 and
6x^2 may be combined to 7x^2.

00:00:06.782 --> 00:00:11.549
And for now, we're going to leave the rest
of the expression as it is. So now, the

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.904
next thing I noticed with this expression
is that we need to multiply the quantity

00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:29.232
x+2 times 7x^2-1.
This gives us 7x^3-x+14x^2-2, and we'll

00:00:29.232 --> 00:00:33.933
leave the rest of the expression the same.
So, our next step is to distribute

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:39.822
the 4 with everything inside the
parenthesis. When we do this, inside the

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:51.553
parenthesis, we get 28x^3-4x+56x^2-8 and
we'll leave the rest of the expression the

00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:57.512
same for now. So, our next step is to
distribute the -1 in front of the

00:00:57.512 --> 00:01:03.533
parenthesis with everything inside and
combine like terms. This gives us our

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:12.609
solution of -28x^3-56x^2+7x+1.
