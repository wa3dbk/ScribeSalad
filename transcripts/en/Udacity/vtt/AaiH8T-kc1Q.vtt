00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.530
Well it started as a US DOD effort,
at or the orange book, then with time

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.900
multiple countries sort of recognized
this importance of software procurement,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.350
they had to worry about security
that they can evaluate for

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.630
those software products.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.020
That evolved into what's called
the Common Criteria which is Is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.390
an international standard.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.320
Common Criteria came from efforts

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.940
in Europe, in Canada, and
the US one that we talked about.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.336
The idea Is that you are consumer of
the system or user of the system,

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:43.221
you're going to specify what needs you
have or what requirements you have.

00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:46.132
Vendor going to sort of
implement a solution and

00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:51.550
going to make claims about that solution
meeting your needs or your requirements.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.530
And in particular, we're talking about
sort of security requirements or

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.720
security properties.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.310
So whoever is going to evaluate is
going to determine whether the vendor

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.060
actually, the claims that they make
are claims that you can believe.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.420
And these claims actually
allow you to say,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.462
well, my needs that I
had specified are met.

00:01:10.462 --> 00:01:15.790
So there's three entities, you have
some requirements, a vendor who provides

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.090
the solution makes a certain set of
claims how they meet those requirements,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.700
and somebody who evaluates has
to then assess those claims,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.900
and the reason we should be able to
trust whatever those claims are about.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.930
Based on that, we're going to
give it an assurance level,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.810
which rates the trustworthiness
of the systems.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.830
Evaluation assurance level or
EAL, we will be

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.930
able to use that to rate a system,
in particular, how well

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.280
it meets the claims about security
properties that are important to us.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.147
So similar to division D,
we said, basically,

00:01:56.147 --> 00:02:00.760
it didn't do very much EAL1 is
the most basic one and EAL7 is

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.580
the most rigorous or the highest level
of trustworthiness that you can get.
