00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.240
I mentioned also, aggregation and composition.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.550
Using aggregation in particular is very common in UML class diagrams. You

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.950
often want to say that one class is related to many instances of another class.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.100
And you use the aggregation association to do this.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.720
It's still an association, it's just adorned with an open diamond to

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.760
indicate that it's a particular kind of association called an aggregation.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.900
I want to say a word, though, about the difference between aggregation and

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.450
composition. It's somewhat subtle, and it gets to the point that aggregation

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.482
doesn't really say much about the semantics of the relationship. In particular,

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:50.890
it doesn't say much about the lifetimes of the participant objects.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.600
For example, let's say you had a house class and room classes.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.240
Clearly, a house has rooms so you'd expect there to be an aggregation there.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.150
But think further, if you destroy the house you're also destroying the rooms.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.320
Therefore, instead of using aggregation, we would use composition. That is,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.520
we'd fill in that diamond. In compositions, there is a responsibility for

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.780
managing the lifetime of the constituent objects. That further

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.710
says that a particular constituent can only belong to one composition.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.390
Compositions also have the transitive property. That is, a house can have room

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.930
and a room can have closets. For aggregations there's no rules like this.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.810
Aggregations are general situations. We might say, for example, that a room has

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.610
a table. Now this is an aggregation situation, because we could certainly

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.100
destroy the room after taking the table out. They have separate lifetimes, and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.260
therefore we'd use aggregation instead of composition.
