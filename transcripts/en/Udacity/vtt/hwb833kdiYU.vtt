00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.890
So Lessons contain instructional videos, quizzes and

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.870
solution videos. In addition to these quizzes

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.260
interspersed throughout the lessons, you'll find a

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.270
problem set at the end of every lesson

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.080
including this one. Problem Sets allow you

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.950
to extend what you've learned to different

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.380
situations. These are more to solidify rather

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.500
than assess your knowledge. So try your best.
