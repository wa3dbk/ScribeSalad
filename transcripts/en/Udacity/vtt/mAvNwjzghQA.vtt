00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.610
So the specific objectives of this lesson are for

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.810
us to learn, in detail, how does the aperture, the shutter speed, and

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.250
ISO which is basically the sensitivity of the film or the sensor,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.872
together form a triangle, let's you then control the exposure of the image

00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:22.830
that you're trying to capture, based on the light that's coming into the camera.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.930
Exposure triangle is a well known concept in photography.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.108
And the reason we want to cover it here is,

00:00:28.108 --> 00:00:31.656
we want to be able to learn about the different aspects of a picture or

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:35.519
an image that's actually captured on a camera by controlling things like

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.150
the aperture size, the shutter speed, and the sensitivity.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.200
And these are, of course, the three aspects of the exposure triangle that camera

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.010
operators use to be able to take the photograph that they're interested in.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.820
We will also show you various types of examples today.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.190
As to what variations of each one of them.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.330
And how it impacts what kind of an image you get.
