00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.330
Noah Lorang of 37signals wrote a provocative blog post stating that he

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.990
only need three charts.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.660
At the end of the post, he has a fun quip asking, what three charts would you

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.650
take with you if you were stranded on a desert island.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.850
Before I cover my slightly more than three favorite charts,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.180
I want you to use what we have talked about to think about which three you would

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.840
take with you to best represent any sort of data that you might encounter.
