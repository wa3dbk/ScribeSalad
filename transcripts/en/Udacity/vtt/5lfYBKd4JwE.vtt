00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.220
Replace the resource XML for the list item

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.630
forecast to split up the single text field

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.640
into multiple fields with the IDs below, while

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.793
keeping the same approximate design. Note that you

00:00:11.793 --> 00:00:13.324
won't just be able to drag additional fields

00:00:13.324 --> 00:00:15.664
onto the existing list_item_forecast layout, since it contains

00:00:15.664 --> 00:00:18.380
only a text view, which means there is no view group to add additional views to.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.280
I recommend deleting list_item_forecast and creating a new

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.410
file if you want to use the visual editor.
