00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.465
Now that we've seen solving a system of equations using substitution and

00:00:04.465 --> 00:00:08.626
elimination, let's see how we can use those skills to solve some more

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:13.478
interesting problems. Let's try one with interest. You invest $10,000 in two

00:00:13.478 --> 00:00:18.122
funds, one of the funds pays at 7.5% and another fund pays at 8%. You earned a

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:23.217
total interest of $787.50. So, how much money did you invest at each rate? Maybe

00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:27.257
you lost your tax forms or maybe you don't have your bank statements. Either

00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:31.353
way, you can use algebra to help figure out how much money you invested in your

00:00:31.353 --> 00:00:35.681
trade. When creating a system of equations, we know that we need two variables,

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:39.826
x and y. This question actually indicates what variables we should use. We're

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:44.351
looking for how much money was invested at 7.5% and at 8%. So that's going to be

00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:48.800
our two variables. I'm going to go ahead and let x be the amount we invested at

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.124
7.5% and y be the amount we invested at 8%. Using these two variables, what

00:00:53.124 --> 00:00:57.637
equation could you write involving the amount of money you invested? You want to

00:00:57.637 --> 00:01:01.734
use an amount plus the amount should equal your total amount. Write that

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:06.749
equation here. And remember, it should involve x and y.
