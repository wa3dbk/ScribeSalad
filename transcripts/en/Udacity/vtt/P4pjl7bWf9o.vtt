00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.310
Welcome to Elementary Statistics.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.059
We're really excited
to have you on board.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.700
My name's Katie and

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm the one who will be explaining most
of the concepts throughout this course.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.640
I'll also be doing a lot of drawing and

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.329
a lot of writing to help you understand
the content as much as possible.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.690
in each of the sixteen
lessons in this course,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.980
you'll learn new methods to describe and
analyze data.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.730
Each lesson builds on
the concepts you learned before.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.640
So as you progress through the course,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.260
try to get a good grasp of
the material before moving on.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.250
But if it turns out you need a review,
no big deal.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.900
You can easily go back and rewatch
the videos and redo the exercises.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.180
What do I mean by exercises?

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.920
Each lesson consists of short
instructional videos where I explain

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.500
cool stat stuff and guide your thinking.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.840
But we want you to make
breakthroughs on your own.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.000
So instead of just telling you a fact or
formula, I'll ask a quiz.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.570
A quiz or exercise, same thing,
is not there for us to judge you or

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.830
to impact your grade.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.860
It's there for your own benefit,
to make you think.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.390
At Udacity, we believe that the chance
to think about something from your

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.460
own unique perspective is
a powerful learning opportunity.
