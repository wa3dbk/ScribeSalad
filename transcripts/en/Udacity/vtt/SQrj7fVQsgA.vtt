00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.450
Now let's look for candidate operations.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.320
An operation is a computational service provided by an object.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.770
In OOA, candidate operations are suggested by looking for

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.500
verbs, particularly action verbs.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.034
In addition to action verbs there are other kinds of

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:20.150
verbs including linking verbs.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.617
Which are typically associated with the word is, they're more likely to

00:00:24.617 --> 00:00:28.950
be descriptive, hence related to attributes rather than to actions.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.631
Another category contains the stative verbs,

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:37.611
typically descriptions of situations rather than of objects.

00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:41.910
And they're going to be indicative of relationships among the objects
