00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.692
It must make the graph more narrow, judging from the fact that this green curve

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.035
is skinnier than this gray curve. And the only difference between our two

00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:13.235
equations is that here, x squared is multiplied by 3, and here, it's just

00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:17.729
multiplied by 1. Otherwise, the graph hasn't moved at all. There is no shift

00:00:17.729 --> 00:00:22.401
horizontally or vertically. It's just the width of the graph that's changed.
