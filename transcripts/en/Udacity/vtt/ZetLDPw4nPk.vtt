00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.431
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The y-intercept is at 0, negative 14. We know that the x-coordinate has to be

00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:10.579
0 because the y-intercept is where this curve hits the y-axis, and the y-axis is

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:15.760
just the line x equals 0. If we substitute 0 in for x in this equation, these

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.044
two terms both turn into 0, and we end up with y equals negative 14. So that's

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:22.231
the y-coordinate.
