00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.630
And highly intelligent in linguistics would be really good for poets, writers,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.330
lawyers, politicians or speech writers. Because they're really good with spoken

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.272
and written words. Scientists, engineers and accountant would really benefit

00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:18.320
from mathematical and logical intelligence. Because they're good at performing

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.950
mathematical operations and analyzing information and problems logically.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.660
Spatial intelligence really helps navigators, pilots, architects and sculptors

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.397
do their job. Because they're really good at solving problems in three

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:35.297
dimensional space. Musical intelligent benefits musicians, songwriters, and

00:00:35.297 --> 00:00:39.444
dancers. Because they have a greater capacity to perform, or compose music, and

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:44.385
to hear patterns and recognize them in music. Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence

00:00:44.385 --> 00:00:48.509
really helps athletes, dancers, mechanics, and carpenters. Because the use

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:52.149
their whole body or different parts of their bodies to solve problems and make

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.172
something or carry out performances. You'll see high levels of interpersonal

00:00:58.172 --> 00:01:02.393
intelligence in people who live contemplative lives, such as rabbis, priests,

00:01:02.393 --> 00:01:07.332
or monks, because they reflect inwards. They really understand who they are,

00:01:07.332 --> 00:01:11.370
and what they want. You'll see high levels of interpersonal intelligence in

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.770
psychologists, politicians, and some types of writers because they understand

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.735
other people and what motivates them. And finally, the naturalist intelligence

00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:23.875
is great for botanists, ecologists, and biologists because they're sensitive to

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:27.775
the natural world, and can understand how to differentiate different living

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:29.819
things.
