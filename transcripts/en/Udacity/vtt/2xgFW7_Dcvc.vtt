00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The Euler forward method is pretty simple again and the time

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that you should find for the explosion should be 0.64.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is a diagram resulting from that setting and this really makes it obvious that the solution

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is escaping to infinity and a finite amount of time.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Actually, this behavior is not that much of a surprise.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
X always has to grow because the right hand side is always positive.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The square is always positive and if you're adding to it and dividing by a positive number,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but as x grows, the square is going to become really huge,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so the rate of change becomes really huge, which leads to x become even higher and so and so on.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This is going to escape to infinity in a finite amount of time.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Footnote for the mathematically proficient, what we're getting here

00:00:50.000 --> 09:59:59.000
is actually the shifted version of the tangent function.
