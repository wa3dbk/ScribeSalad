00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.010
So to summarize this overall architectural design process, phase zero

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.930
was specifying properties, and this involved constructing the context diagram.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.846
Indicating the external actors but only one activity the system itself.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:18.430
We indicated external stimuli or events. That can affect the system.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.514
We have the external actors being the user and the file system.

00:00:23.514 --> 00:00:27.380
We indicated how the system communicates its results back to the external actor.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.281
Those are the percepts. And then we specified in English, the behaviors that you

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:36.406
want the system to have, and we used as starting point for that, used cases or

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:40.343
scenarios that we developed when we looked at the exercises at the start of

00:00:40.343 --> 00:00:45.360
the term. In Phase 1 we componentized. Which meant decomposing the system into

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.760
components, reallocating responsibilities to them, for handling events and for

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.360
delivering percepts, and we assigned responsibility for the vary,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.390
guaranteeing the various properties. In Phase 2 we chose an architectural style,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.717
and that in turn specified how the components will interact. We chose a layered

00:01:04.717 --> 00:01:08.715
implicit invocation architecture, we have assigned the components to layers,

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:13.455
we determined the dependencies between the layers, we updated our guarantees,

00:01:13.455 --> 00:01:19.140
we selected an invariant maintenance strategy, and we've assigned,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.780
in doing so, that assigned responsibility for maintaining those invariants.
