00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.830
Mobile devices not only have different numbers of actual

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.610
pixels, but they fit very different numbers of pixels

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.560
into each inch of screen real estate. So, to

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.030
get roughly consistent formatting, they pass different numbers of layout

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.290
pixels into the view port. This chart shows the

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.700
number of physical pixels for each device, the device pixel

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.660
ratio. And then the resulting layout viewport. If we

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.420
look at the number of device independent pixels per inch,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.290
this results in for each of these devices, we'll

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.320
note that almost all the mobile devices are very

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.220
close to 160 device independent pixels per inch. This

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.960
makes layout design much easier for us. The device pixel

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.040
ratio gives you a clue as to how high

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.080
resolution the screen really is. Not just how many

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.140
layout pixels there are. You can use device pixel

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.310
ratio in media queries to control properties like background images.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.030
And in fact, this is going to become very interesting in

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.390
the next lesson, where we learn about how to use adaptive images.
