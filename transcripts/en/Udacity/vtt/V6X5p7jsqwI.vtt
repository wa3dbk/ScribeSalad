00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.888
Unlike the Z and T tests, the distribution of the F-statistics is not

00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:09.223
symmetrical. The F distribution is positively skewed, meaning it peaks on the

00:00:09.223 --> 00:00:15.526
left side and is stretched off to the right side. This distribution peaks at 1.

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:19.878
This is because if there are no differences in the population means, in other

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:25.824
words the between group variability is. Expected to be 0. Then the mean of each

00:00:25.824 --> 00:00:30.925
sample will still, likely differ by chance. Since the difference, then, is due

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:35.637
to chance. The same way that each subject in each sample differs by chance, as

00:00:35.637 --> 00:00:41.256
measured by the within-group variability. Then the between group variability

00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:46.564
and within group variability will be the same. Therefore, when we divide them

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:51.739
we get 1. And that's where this distribution peaks. Also note that when we're

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.759
doing an F test, this will always be non-directional. Whereas when we were

00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:00.851
doing the Z and T test, our alternative hypothesis could have been that one

00:01:00.851 --> 00:01:06.613
population mean is less than another. With the F test, we only know if there's

00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:11.932
a significant difference. Our critical region will always be out here in the

00:01:11.932 --> 00:01:17.698
upper tail. But everything else is essentially the same. We choose an alpha

00:01:17.698 --> 00:01:22.279
level, usually 0.05. And then we find out if our F-statistic lies in the

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:27.469
critical region or not. If it lies in the critical region, we know that at

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.450
least two population means will be significantly different.
