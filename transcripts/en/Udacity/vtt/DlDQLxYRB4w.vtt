00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.500
Now you may notice that some of these points are spread

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.440
out from one another, while others are stacked right on top of

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.340
each other. This area of the graph is considered to be over

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.750
plotted. Over plotting makes it difficult to tell how many points are

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.180
in each region. So we can set the transparency of the

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.880
points using the alpha parameter and geom point. I'm going to add this

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.800
on a new line so that we can see our layers more

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.970
clearly. Next I set the alpha parameter equal to 1 over 20.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.760
So this means it's going to take 20 points to

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.950
be the equivalent of one of these black dots. Writing

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.659
this code, we can see that the bulk of our

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.370
data lies below the 1000 threshold for friend count. Now

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.550
let's also add a little jitter here too. We can

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.150
swap out geom_point with the geom_jitter. Age is a continuous

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.160
variable but you really only have integer values, so we

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.030
are seeing these perfectly lined up columns. Which isn't a

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.830
true reflection of age. These columns should feel intuitively wrong

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.010
and we want to make sure that we can see more

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.870
of the points. So using jitter we can add some

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.310
noise to each age so we get a clearer picture

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.630
of the relationship between age and friend count. Writing our

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.830
code with geom_jitter we can see that we get a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.320
more disperse distribution. What stands out to you in this

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.650
new plot? Keep in mind that the alpha is set to

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.359
120th or 0.05.
