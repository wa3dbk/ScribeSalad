00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now for the solution to the second problem of Unit 3,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
let's start it by adding in a constraint to the system with this line right here about n.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This shows, I've explained earlier, that the total population n remains constant in all times.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The people just switching between the S and I groups.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now let's move on to the core of the problem.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Switching the contents to the for loop to use the trapezoidal rule

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
instead of the forward Euler method.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We begin with the standard expressions for Ṡ and İ,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but this time showing that people can move from the infected population

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
back to the susceptible population directly.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Just for simplicity, I'm going to call our constants a and b right now

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and I'll change them later to show what's actually in the code.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now we can get a single equation that encapsulates

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the information in all three of these equations if we just substitute N-I for S in the equation for İ.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This is what this line right here shows.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If we do a little bit of rearranging and simplifying, we get a quadratic equation for I-dot.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now this make things a lot simpler altogether because now we have one equation

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and one independent variable instead of three equations in two independent variables.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Now it's time to move on and use the trapezoidal rule.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You'll notice here that I'm using a t in the subscripts instead of an n this time.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That's just so that we don't get confused between big N's and the little n's.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So we know that for the t+1 time step, I is going to equal this expression just in the trapezoidal rule.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
However, we just created an equation for I-dot that depends only on I.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So we can plug that expression in to get this expanded equation right here.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Since many of the terms in this expression have factors of h/2 and a outside of them,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I'm just going to pull out a factor of ha/2.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
With a little bit of rearranging, we come up with this long expression.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now we can think of this equation as made up of two parts--

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
one part that involves I sub-t+1 and another part that just involves I sub-t.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Since we want to think of I t+1 as the only independent variable,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
we can lump everything else under other variable names.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Looking at the equation, we have one term with (I subt+1)² .

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
A couple of terms with I t+1¹ and several terms that don't have I t+1 at all

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and we're going to call everything that's in front of I t+1¹p.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And we're going to call everything that doesn't involve at all q and this is going to give us

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the simplified quadratic expression that shows very clearly

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
how this is a quadratic equation using I sub-t+1.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Using the quadratic formula and rearranging a little bit, we get this expression right here

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
using p and q to express I sub-t+1.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Now this actually has two possible solutions--

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
one with a plus sign here and then one with the minus sign here.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So how do we decide which one to pick? Well we know that this h to times that goes to zero.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We want I sub-t+1 and I sub-t to get closer and closer together

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
since the curve is going to become smoother and smoother.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Since p has a term of 1/h inside of it, this means that p is going to infinity as this happens.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If we pick the minus sign over here, they're going to have minus infinity,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
which means that I-sub-t + 1

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
is definitely going to go to negative infinity and this is definitely not what we want.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So just to be safe, we will pick the plus sign here.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Now we return to the code where we've translated our expressions for p and q into Python.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
To do this, we have to remember that the coefficients a and b that we were using

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
when we're writing things by hand actually each have different names in the code.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
A is equal to a transmission coefficient and b is equal to one over the infectious time.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Using this information, you've just done a simple translation of p and q into Python.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
This makes writing out the expressions for I step+1 and S step+1 very easy.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
For I step+1, we just write in the solution that we got from using the quadratic formula

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
using of course the plus sign right here in the variables p and q

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
since they are just written right here anyway.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Because we know that I plus S is always equal to n,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
our expression for S is simply equal to n-I at the time step.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Now, let's run this first with step size 0.5 and see what happens. This looks very nice.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We have two really smooth curves with the infectious population is green

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and the susceptible population is blue just like in the last problem.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We see that since each curve in the plot approaches a constant value at long times

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
we're approaching a steady state situation.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Now let's run the program instead with step size 10.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So this is what we get from our model if we're using h=10 instead of h=0.5.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Even though now that the curves is particularly smooth,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
we can see that they obey the same overall pattern as we saw in our graph using the smaller step size.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The most important thing is that we still are approaching

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
a stead state situation at the end of the graph.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Now think back to what happen when you run the supplied code like we ask you to.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
When you run the supplied code with h=0.5, you should have gotten a graph that looks like this.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
This definitely looks a lot like what we saw when we run the solution code using h=0.5 as well.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
However, let's peek at what happen when you use h=10 using the forward Euler method.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
You can see that there are a lot of differences between this and the graph that we just saw

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and also between this and the graph with the solution code when we had h=10.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
The most important thing to notice though is what's happening over here in this region.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
You can see that instead of each curve approaching one set value as time goes on

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
they keep crossing paths at each other.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
In other words, since I and S here don't obey nearly the same trend that they do

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
with smaller step sizes, this shows that the forward Euler method doesn't allow for stability

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
with large step sizes nearly as well as implicit methods like the trapezoidal method do.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Hope that was an interesting investigation with the difference between implicit methods

00:05:41.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and other kinds of methods and get ready for the last problem of Unit 3.
