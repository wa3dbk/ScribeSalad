00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.870
In this lesson we will talk about viruses and internet worms. Let's first

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.230
define what a virus is, and then define what a worm is. A virus is

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.800
effectively an infection of an existing program

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.840
that results in the modification of the

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.880
original program's behavior. A worm is code

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.330
that propagates and replicates itself across the network.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.650
A worm is usually spread by exploiting flaws in existing programs or

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.360
open services whereas viruses typically require

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.200
user action to spread. For example, opening

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.990
an attachment on an email or running an executable file that a friend gave

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.760
you on an USB key. Worms propagate automatically. We will focus most

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.350
of our attention on internet worms. But before we dive into the details

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.590
of internet worms, let's first talk about

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.310
the different types of viruses. A parasitic

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.319
virus typically infects an existing executable

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.990
file. A memory- resident virus infects running

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.660
programs. A boot-sector virus spreads whenever the

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.410
system is booted. A polymorphic virus encrypts

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.790
part of the virus program using a randomly generated key. So one of the key

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.250
differences between viruses and worms is that viruses typically

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.740
spread with manual user intervention. Worms

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.760
typically spread automatically by scanning for

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.670
vulnerabilities and infecting vulnerable hosts when

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.640
those vulnerabilities are discovered. A worm might

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.680
use any of these techniques to infect a particular host before spreading

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.890
further. In the rest of the lesson we will first talk about a brief history

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.570
of internet worms, including the first Internet

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.960
worm, called the Morris worm, and other

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.120
famous Internet worms from the early days of Internet worms in the early 2000's,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.710
including Code Red and other well-known Internet worms of the time. We'll

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.810
then talk about how to model the spread of a worm, in terms of scanning and

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.090
infection rates, using analogies from epidemiology. Finally,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.260
we'll talk about design techniques for designing

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.350
super fast-spreading worms. And we'll look at

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.754
an example of a super fast-spreading worm.
