00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.873
Try multiplying these radicals out. Keep in mind that you have a cubed root

00:00:03.873 --> 00:00:08.541
here. Now when we multiply it we don't change the index of the root. We just

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:12.476
multiply by what's underneath. Then when we simplify, since we have a cubed

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:15.638
root we only want to take out factors that appear three times underneath the

00:00:15.638 --> 00:00:20.182
radical. Use your knowledge of power divided by roots. And your knowledge of

00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:22.299
factors, to get to the simplified form.
