00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.450
Let's have the solution for our PSHARE versus

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.210
GSHARE quiz. The question is, for all of

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.670
the branches in this code, how much history do we need to make them all very

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.386
well predicted? We have 1, 2, 3 branches. This

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:20.910
branch here is easily predictable even without any history. So for this one,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.702
any history will work. The exit branch. We do 1,000

00:00:25.702 --> 00:00:29.310
iteration, each time it's not taken except the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.760
last time. So for this branch again we

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.216
don't need much history. Even with no history

00:00:36.216 --> 00:00:38.246
using just a 2 bit counter we will predict

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.914
this branch accurately 1000 times followed by one

00:00:40.914 --> 00:00:43.829
misprediction so it's a very good prediction rate still.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.276
This branch however, requires some history. This is

00:00:48.276 --> 00:00:50.916
the even-odd branch, so we really need to know

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:53.622
whether the previous outcome was even or odd, so

00:00:53.622 --> 00:00:56.646
that we can do the opposite. For PShare, the

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:59.544
even-odd handling can be done with just a history

00:00:59.544 --> 00:01:01.821
length of 1 and the history length of 1

00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:07.495
will work well for these two as well. So we just need a history length of 1. For

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:11.295
GShare, when we are doing this branch, we want

00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:15.960
its previous outcome to be part of the global history.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.112
If we look at what the global history looks like, this branch is not

00:01:21.112 --> 00:01:26.090
taken, so the global history will be 0. This branch in the very

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.040
first iteration, because i.e is 1000, that's divisible

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.060
by 2, is taken because the number is even. This branch is is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.105
then taken. Then we have this branch 0. Now it's going to be

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:45.044
not taken here, followed by a taken here, and

00:01:45.044 --> 00:01:49.362
this pattern will repeat. So really, we need this to

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:53.130
be part of the history when we're predicting this. We

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.100
need this to be part of the history when we're

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.701
predicting this and so on. In order to do

00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:00.263
that, we need the history to contain at least this

00:02:00.263 --> 00:02:03.598
much which is 3 bits. And similarly here we need

00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:06.630
this to be our history, so it catches this bit.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.685
Know that really, there are only 2 possible histories

00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:12.106
for this branch. One is the 1, 1, 0 and

00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:14.416
the other is 0, 1, 0 because the other

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:17.650
two branches are just having the same outcome every time,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.490
so we need a 3-bit history. As you can

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.480
see, GShare can do a similar job to PShare except

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.480
that it needs a longer history. Even for branches that

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.790
are actually kind of self determining. Note that GShare can

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.830
also do those correlative branches that PShare cannot do.
