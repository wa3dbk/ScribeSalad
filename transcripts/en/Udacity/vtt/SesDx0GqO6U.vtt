00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.110
Let's first take a look at the contents of an HTTP Request. First there's

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.810
the Request Line which typically indicates first,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.620
a method of request. Where typical methods

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.310
get to return the content associated with the URL. A Post which sends data

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.230
to the server and a Head Request which returns, typically, only the headers of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.120
the Get Response, but not the content. It's worth

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.250
noting that a Get Request can also be used

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.560
to send data from the content to the server.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.240
The request line also includes the URL which is

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.050
relative, and may be something like index.HTML and it

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.120
also includes the version number of the HTTP protocol.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.090
The request also contains additional headers, many of which

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.650
are optional. These include the referer, which indicates the

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.540
URL that caused the page to be requested. For

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.980
example, if an object is being requested as part

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.970
of embedded content in another page, the referrer might

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.600
be the page that's embedding the content. Another example

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.220
header is the user agent, which is the client

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.500
software that's being used to fetch the page. For

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.430
example, you might fetch a page using a particular

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.850
version of Chrome or Firefox. And the user agent

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.780
informs the server which, client software is being used.
