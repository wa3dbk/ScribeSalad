00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Norvig] The crux of the whole matter is doing the assignments.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
There are 2 ways to do it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We can deduce what assignment must be true--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that it must be the case that the Englishman is in a certain house.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Or we can just try different possibilities--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
try to put the Englishman in house 1, then in house 2, then in house 3 and see what works.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You'd have to be very clever to figure out how to do all these deductions,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and I don't want to try to be that clever.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I want to see if I can get by with just trying all the possibilities,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
make the computer do the work so I don't have to.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So let's approach that and let's say we're going to try all possibilities.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And so first we put the Englishman into house 1,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and later we'll try him in houses 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What about the Spaniard?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If the Englishman is in house 1, what possibilities should we try for the Spaniard?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Give me your best answer:

00:00:51.000 --> 09:59:59.000
all the numbers; only 1; only 2; or 2, 3, 4, 5.
