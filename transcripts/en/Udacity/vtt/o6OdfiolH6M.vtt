The run is the difference between the x values. If we travel all the way over

00:00:04.306 --> 00:00:08.791
here to the right, we want to subtract off this distance so we're left with just

00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:13.256
the run. This is a really tough question. So great job if you got it right. If

00:00:13.256 --> 00:00:17.009
not, hang in there and we'll keep learning some more about slope.
