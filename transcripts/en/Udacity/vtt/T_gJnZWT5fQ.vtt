00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.106
Quick quiz to make sure we're all on the same page. Two quick questions.

00:00:03.106 --> 00:00:06.709
One, how many multiplications will this CPU code perform?

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:12.232
And two, assuming that each multiplication operation takes 2 nanoseconds and everything else is free,

00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:15.482
how long will it take to compute the entire computation?
