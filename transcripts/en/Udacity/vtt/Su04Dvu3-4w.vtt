00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.100
So, in this question, I'm showing you three processes,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.400
P1, P2 and P3. And these are the events

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.590
that you can see happening in these three processes.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.420
And, what I want you to do is to

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.820
derive a total order and in deriving the total

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.020
order, we're going to use Process ID to break the

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.930
tie. And smaller the Process ID, the higher the

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.480
priority. In other words, P1 dominates P2 dominates P3.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.870
So, using that, go ahead and derive a total order for this

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.130
set of events that I'm showing you happening in the distributed system.
