00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.800
So why do we need to find the lowest common denominator? Well remember that we

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.420
have to find a common denominator in order to add or subtract fractions. In our

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.028
very first example, we needed to have 90th in order to add these two fractions

00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:18.772
together. In the second example, we needed to have a common denominator of 2ks

00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:23.620
squared in order to add these two fractions together. Once we have a lowest

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.030
common denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator in each

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.159
fraction by the factors that are missing to change our fraction into an

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:38.378
equivalent form. So for 18, it was missing a factor of five. So we multiplied by

00:00:38.378 --> 00:00:43.086
5 divided by 5. Likewise for the denominator 2 s squared, we multiply this

00:00:43.086 --> 00:00:49.364
fraction by k over k. Since k is the missing factor. From 2s squared. When we

00:00:49.364 --> 00:00:54.100
multiply by k divided by k, we're really multiplying by 1, and we're changing

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.577
our first fraction into its equivalent form. So let's go back to our third

00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:03.314
example of finding the LCD. We found the lowest common denominator for these two

00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:08.100
fractions, and it was p minus 1, times p minus 2, times p plus 3. Remember we

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.286
want to change these two fractions to an equivalent form. So here's your

00:01:12.286 --> 00:01:16.592
question. What should we multiply each of these fractions by to get an

00:01:16.592 --> 00:01:20.753
equivalent fraction with a lowest common denominator of this?
