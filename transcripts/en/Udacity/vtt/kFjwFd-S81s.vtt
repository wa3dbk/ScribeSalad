00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.847
For renting our car we found an equation and a line that represents this

00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:08.230
statement. Now let's try and tackle the cost of the car rental. Car-nival will

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.388
charge a $5 registration fee just for us to get the keys to the car, and that's

00:00:12.388 --> 00:00:16.547
not driving it anywhere. Then they'll charge an additional $10 per hour for

00:00:16.547 --> 00:00:20.757
renting the car. So let's come up with an equation for this statement. If x is

00:00:20.757 --> 00:00:24.585
the total number of hours for renting the car, and y is the total cost of

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:28.890
renting the car, which of these equations would represent our total cost? Try

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.182
creating a table if you feel stuck. Think about what you would pay for 1 hour of

00:00:33.182 --> 00:00:37.465
renting the car and 2 hours of renting the car. Maybe you can find the pattern.
