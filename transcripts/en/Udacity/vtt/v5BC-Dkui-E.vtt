So I got this program to work, but I send this program to my friend, she's

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.110
going to be a little bit confused. She won't know what it does. Let's look at

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.620
the program again. There's nothing in here that says that the point of this

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.450
program is to calculate the number of days that Sally Ride lived. So why don't

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.220
you go back, write some comments for your code, and then I'll show you the

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.400
comments that I might have written.
