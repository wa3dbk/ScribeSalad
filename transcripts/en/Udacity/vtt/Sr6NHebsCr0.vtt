00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.730
I actually just started going through
the process of proving this and

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.730
it was an awful lot like stuff
that we've already done,

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.250
in terms of taking bellman equations
minus other bellman equations.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.840
So let me just jump to the punch line.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.270
So if you push the math all the way
through, what you find is that

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.640
all the transitions and
rewards are alpha close to each other,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.700
then the difference in the values that
you get for following the policy is

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.160
going to be no more than G over one
minus gamma, where G is that alpha.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.780
That error amount, plus a discounted
version of that error amount,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.430
times the maximum reward that we get for
forever.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.896
Right, so this is actually
the maximum value that you can get.

00:00:39.896 --> 00:00:43.147
If you get the maximum reward over and
over and over again.

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:43.820
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.933
&gt;&gt; So, this just gives a quantity.

00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:49.841
And it has some properties
that you'd expect,

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:54.923
like the fact that if we estimate
the parameters perfectly and

00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:59.080
alpha is zero,
then this is zero plus zero.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.320
And then, this is zero over
one minus gamma, which zero.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.470
So, the two value functions
are actually identical.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.800
But they fall off from each other.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.380
So, if this alpha is something not zero,
some slightly bigger than zero,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.130
then these value functions
are going to be off by a bit more.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.400
So ultimately what we're
going to want is, we want to know

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.390
how accurately do we have to
estimate the transition and rewards?

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.630
What should alpha be so that the
difference between the value that we get

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.540
by running in our simulation of
the model, and the value that we get

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.280
running in the actual MDP,
are really small, like epsilon close.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.950
So I think all we need to do, actually,
is solve for alpha, in terms of epsilon,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.320
to be able to see how accurately we need
to do our estimates to make sure that,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.110
ultimately, our values
are going to be close.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.990
&gt;&gt; That makes sense to me.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.155
&gt;&gt; So this is me now solving for Alpha,
and we end up with this expression here,

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:56.837
[SOUND] which says that, that we need
to take the epsilon that we want,

00:01:56.837 --> 00:02:01.875
how close we want the values to be,
and then transform it in various ways.

00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:06.182
Actually make it a heck of a lot
smaller, and that gives us how accurate

00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:10.479
we need the estimate to
the transitions and rewards to be.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.440
So we know that we're going to be
that close in terms of the value.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.110
&gt;&gt; Sure, that's intuitively obvious,
even to the most casual observer.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.465
&gt;&gt; Well, okay,
you're probably being sarcastic.

00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:20.720
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Possibly.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.570
&gt;&gt; So it's maybe not completely obvious
but I, you know, I did algebra here so

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.120
it's, it's not,
it's not deep but it's not,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.080
it's not intuitively obvious
why it should have this form.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.030
In fact, usually, I don't know.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.220
Epsilons are like one over.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.160
Oh, but I guess we're trying
to define a quantity, alpha,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.730
which is like an epsilon quantity.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.090
So it wouldn't make sense for
it to be a giant number.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.430
It should be a tiny, tiny number.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.530
But, yeah.
No, no, you're right.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.730
It's not completely obvious.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.410
But the point.
The point that I want to make with this

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.615
is they're polynomially
related to each other.

00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:50.115
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:50.115 --> 00:02:52.038
So if we have RMAX, and

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:56.070
one over one minus gamma, and one over
epsilon, then the kind of alpha that we

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.990
get out is going to be polynomially
related to the other things.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.690
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So that's reassuring.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.080
I mean, if you actually work out what
these numbers are, they're pretty scary.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.330
But, you know, we're, we're trying to
not let ourselves be scared of that.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.617
The important thing though is that
alpha's not really a parameter of RMAX,

00:03:13.617 --> 00:03:15.680
the RMAX algorithm.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.480
Right?

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.283
What was the parameter that we had
when we talked about the algorithm.

00:03:21.283 --> 00:03:22.011
&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]
&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]

00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:22.675
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [FOREIGN]

00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:23.995
&gt;&gt; So, that is to say,

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:26.685
what we want is a parameter that
says how many times do we have to

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:31.630
try a state action pair,
before we are confident that our

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.330
estimate of that transition
probability is better than alpha?

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.240
So, how are we going to
get that last piece?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.490
How are we going to turn alpha into C?

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.080
&gt;&gt; More algebra?

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but specifically,
there's bounds that come into play here.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.330
So now, we've actually turned
it into the same kind of problem

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.010
as the bandit problems that
we were talking about, right?

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.510
That we need to know, how many times
do we pull a bandit arm before your

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.120
estimate in the mean
is sufficiently close?

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.380
And that is the Hoeffding bound.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.180
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.870
You did say we were going
to use Hoeffding bounds.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the union bound.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.090
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.110
&gt;&gt; We want to simultaneously
make this alpha

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.490
close estimate hold across
all state action pairs.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.250
So we need to make the c big enough, so

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.730
that the probability that it fails in
any one of them is sufficiently small.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.899
But it really is exactly the same
argument that we did when

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.140
we were talking about bandits.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.780
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.540
And, sure.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.580
So, every.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.460
Every state action
pair is like a bandit,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.380
and you have to pull it
a certain number of times.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.530
&gt;&gt; It's like an estimate of an arm,
right, and

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.220
we need all the arm estimates
to be accurate if we want

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.580
the arm that we eventually
pick to be near the optimal.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.820
&gt;&gt; Right, okay.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.480
No, that makes
&gt;&gt; That, you know?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.250
I can see the analogy.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.230
I can see the metaphor.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.995
I can see the simile.

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:42.060
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, perfect.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.670
So, okay.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.530
There's one more piece to this story,
and

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.220
then I think we're
doing with exploration.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.040
&gt;&gt; Yay,
we'd be done exploring exploration.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.065
That sounded sort of sad.

00:04:49.065 --> 00:04:50.084
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
