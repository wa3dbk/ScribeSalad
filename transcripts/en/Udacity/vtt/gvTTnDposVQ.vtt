00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.900
So let's look at some of the challenges
of computing depth from defocus.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.000
One, it's extremely hard to discriminate
a scene where basically there

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.670
is smooth information or there is blur
information, specifically defocus blur.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.280
And, of course, once we've figured
out if there is defocus blur,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.632
it's hard to actually undo it.

00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:22.070
So here basically again is example,
how do we know this is out of focus?

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.080
Again, by looking at it we
can kind of see it's blurry.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.170
And how do we know what
kind of blur it is?

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.960
Remember when we talked about cameras,
blurry images can be caused by a variety

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.080
of reasons, this could have been
a blur because the camera shook.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.360
How do we know it's actually a blur
because of it's out of focus, or

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.430
the focus plane is in front of or
behind it.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.410
Another part of it is,
how to get rid of blur.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.600
Well, there is a vast amount of
literature in image processing.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.911
So if somebody gave you an image like
this, you can actually run an algorithm,

00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:54.019
specifically the
Lucy-Richardson Algorithm,

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.840
which again has been know since 1972,
74.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.490
Which would actually deconvolve this
image to be able to generate a sharper,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.980
or attempt to create a sharper image.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.230
But of course, if you notice here
there is an artifact called ringing,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.490
you can see different types of
things across the five and the four.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.050
This is an artifact that would come
in because we're trying to take this

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.400
information and
use that to sharpen an image.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.520
And after certain kinds of sharpening
effects you'll actually get

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.760
artifacts like this.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.890
Part of the reason is, again, if you
have an original image that's blurry

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.080
like this, you really can't completely
generate something out of nothing.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.110
There's no information,
you can't create it.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.640
One of the mantras always used
in computational photography is,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.320
what you see is all you get.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.640
That basically reduces the space
of what you can do with an image.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.610
If you actually have a bad image
there are other ways you can try to

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.270
perfect it.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.930
And we'll actually talk about
those types of things, too.
