00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.110
So in more general terms, why do we want to

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.330
use object orientation? The first reason is that object

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.530
orientation can help reduce long-term maintenance costs by limiting

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.700
the effects of changes. As we saw, the effect

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.990
of using encapsulation and information hiding makes it easier

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.700
to modify parts of the system without affecting the

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.590
rest of the system. Object orientation can also improve

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.870
the developing process by favoring code and design reuse.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.840
In general, object orientation helps

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.750
enforcing good design principles. Principles such

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.880
as the ones that we saw in encapuslation, information hiding, high

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.470
cohesion, low coupling and we will discuss these aspects more extensively

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.750
in the next mini course which is centered around design concepts.
