00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.328
In this exercise, you'll make a river flow. Well, it's more like a square lake

00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:06.088
than a river and really the texture should be more stretched to look like

00:00:06.088 --> 00:00:10.466
flowing water and the banks of the river - well, well never mind. This is an

00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:13.720
exercise after all so I want to keep it simple. The initial code doesn't have

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.420
anything moving. Your job is to use the texture transform feature in Three.js

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.708
to animate the water as shown, moving from top to bottom. The rate of movement

00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:24.946
is one second per copy of the texture. In other words, when the texture repeat

00:00:24.946 --> 00:00:28.282
is three, a point at the top of the square will take three seconds to move from

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:31.741
top to bottom. When the repeat is changed to one, the top of the texture moves

00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:35.431
down the screen in one second. For your solution, the movement should be tied

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:38.949
to the elapsed time in the real world. If you look just above where your code

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.289
should go, you'll see how the texture repetition parameter is set on the

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.869
texture. You'll need similar code in your solution.
