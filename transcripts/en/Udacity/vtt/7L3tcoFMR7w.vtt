00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.895
Our next topic in planning is called hierarchical planning.

00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:05.500
We'll introduce the idea to you.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.758
We'll also introduce the representation called hierarchical task network to you.

00:00:09.758 --> 00:00:14.810
HTN for hierarchical task network. To illustrate hierarchical planning,

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.830
imagine that you are still in the box microworld. Here is the initial state. And

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.600
here is the goal state. These states are more complicated than any

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.800
initial state and goal state that we have encountered so far. So as previously,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.060
we can use partial order planning to come up with a plan to go from

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.729
this initial state to goal state. Here is the final plan, and as you can see,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.220
it's pretty long and complicated, with a large number of operations in them. So

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.020
the question then becomes, can we abstract some of these operations at a higher

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.080
level? So that instead of thinking in terms of these slow level move operations,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.870
we can think in terms of high level macro operations. And

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.160
those macro operations will then make the problems space much smaller,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.670
much simpler so that we can navigate it.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.950
And then we can expand those macro operators into the move operations.
