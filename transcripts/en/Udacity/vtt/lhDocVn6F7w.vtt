00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.180
Here's an example of a CCDA
section-level template.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.910
Note that it has a template ID.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.660
Also note this code and
this designation for the coding system.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.080
It's actually an OID designation.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.380
Now copy the template ID and go to
this URL to answer the next question.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.910
So did you find that this template
is called the subjective section,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.770
the objective section, the medications
section, or the lab test section?
