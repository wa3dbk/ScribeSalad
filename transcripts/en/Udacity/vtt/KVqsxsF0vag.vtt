00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:04.139
So remember that our goal is to maximize the amount of useful computation done per second,

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:09.125
and we've been talking a lot about optimizing memory access because that's usually the bottleneck for GPU codes,

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:13.317
but some codes, or some portions of codes, are limited by the actual computation,

00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:15.793
so let's talk about optimizing compute performance.

00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:22.856
This topic boils down to two simple guidelines: minimize time spent waiting at barriers and minimize thread divergence.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:26.161
Now, we've already seen an example of the first optimization.

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:31.476
Too much time spent waiting at barriers prevented us, in our tile transpose code,

00:00:31.476 --> 00:00:35.867
from making memory accesses fast enough to saturate global memory bandwidth.

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:38.074
By shrinking the number of threads in the thread block,

00:00:38.074 --> 00:00:42.613
we're able to minimize the number of them that were actually waiting on the barrier

00:00:42.613 --> 00:00:45.781
and get closer to fully utilizing the global memory.
