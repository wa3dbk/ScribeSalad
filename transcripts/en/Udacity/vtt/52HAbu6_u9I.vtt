00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.510
We can do the same with normal distributions, which are modeled by a special

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.570
probability density function. We're not going to go over the equation for this

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.288
probability density function in this course. But if you want, you can easily

00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:18.562
look it up and see what it is. And that might be pretty cool for some of you

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:22.856
who want a little more information. But basically, since we have this

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:28.228
theoretical curve, we can model it with an equation. And using this equation,

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:32.595
we can use Calculus with a curve. But, we don't need to use Calculus, because

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:36.820
someone else already did. And then, they created a special table, so we can

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.140
always figure out the area under the curve between any two value. We're going

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.495
to use this table later. First, let's make sure we're all up to speed on the

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:52.120
normal probability density function and the area underneath. First, the tails

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.549
never actually touch the x-axis, they get closer and closer to the x-axis. So,

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.505
the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote. The reason the tails of this thoretical

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:07.665
model don't touch the x-axis is basically because we can never be 100% sure of

00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:14.576
anything. In other words, we could have a value way out here, really far from

00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:21.743
the mean, like five standard deviations away. But the probability of getting

00:01:21.743 --> 00:01:27.701
this value or lower is very small. And it's equal to the area under the curve.

00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:32.201
So, if we could zoom in, we would see this tail get closer and closer to the

00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:38.640
x-axis but never touching. And then, the area in between the tail and the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.995
x-axis, all the way to negative infinity is the probability of getting this

00:01:43.995 --> 00:01:51.665
value or lower. We'll go more into depth in that in a second. And similarly, we

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:57.266
could get a value way out here. But the probability is very small. So

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:01.938
basically, what you have to remember is that if we have a certain value, let's

00:02:01.938 --> 00:02:08.220
just call it x for now. That the area under the curve from negative infinity to

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.746
x is equal to the probability of randomly selecting a subject in our sample

00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:19.276
less than x. And this is equal to the proportion in the sample or population

00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:27.422
with scores less than x. If this probability is 80%, then we say x is the 80th

00:02:27.422 --> 00:02:32.540
percentile. If this probability is 90%, we say x is the 90th percentile, etc.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.985
If this is a little confusing, don't worry. That's the whole point of this

00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:40.204
lesson. You're going to get really comfortable with using the probability

00:02:40.204 --> 00:02:45.160
density functions and analyzing this area, and finding this area.
