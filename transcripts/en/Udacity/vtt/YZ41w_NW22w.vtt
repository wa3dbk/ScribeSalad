00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, one other thing affects pricing, and we should think about it.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If you remember our discussion about market type,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we have existing markets, we resegment markets, we might be in a new market,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or in a country outside the United States we might cloning an existing business model.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But if we're in an existing market,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we've got to think about competition.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Is there a monopoly?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Is there a duopoly? An oligopoly?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That is, are there dominant players that really shape the pricing in our markets?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What we really want to understand is what's their product?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What are their costs and prices?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And what pricing will make them feel the worst?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
More importantly, can we do strategies like bracket them?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Can we undercut them? Can we niche or blue ocean strategy them?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
These are the things you want to think about.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If there are dominant players in an existing market,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
you want to actually have pricing as a strategy,

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
not just a reaction.
