00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.890
Cool. Now that we know that we can use

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.600
logging to debug our app, we're going to return to

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.210
this networking code snippet here and drop it into

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.380
the sunshine app to query for actual weather data. Open

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.550
up your project in main activity.java. In this class,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.420
scroll down to the placeholder fragment class within the placeholder

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.010
fragment class in the on create view method, scroll down

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.490
and go ahead and add the networking code snippet here.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.410
To get her blank, is pasted below again if you need it. You may need to enable

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.700
these options in auto import or add the imports

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.990
manually. See the instructions below. When you run the

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.930
app, you'll see that is crashes. Use log

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.430
cat to figure out which error is the guilty

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.290
culprit that caused the crash. We're assuming that for

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.080
this quiz question. You're using a device that's running

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.160
honeycomb or later. Use the emulator if needed.
