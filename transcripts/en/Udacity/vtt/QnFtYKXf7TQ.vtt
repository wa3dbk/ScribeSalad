00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.390
My first piece of advice comes from the design field.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.770
Get It Right In Black And White.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.500
Before you begin adding color to your data visualization,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.940
you should determine if you need color in the first place.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.680
Many times, black, white and

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.800
shades of grey will be enough to effectively convey your information.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.200
Secondly if you are going to use color,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.120
consider using less intense colors, such as natural colors or pastels.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.600
You can also add some gray value to bright colors, to make them less vibrant.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.590
Colors with higher gray values have a softer feel, and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.190
the eye can concentrate on them for longer periods of time.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.670
Rainbow colors, primary colors, and

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.810
other bright bold colors, can create noisy visualizations which strain the eye.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.780
Even if all these bars were a bright red color,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.360
I probably wouldn't want to stare at it too long.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.340
As you encounter graphics, you should look for

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.880
this to determine how this is affecting you as a viewer.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.750
My final tip is to make color selections thar facilitate communication.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.440
In this example, I used a complimentary color to draw attention to

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.040
the count of ideal cut diamonds.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.910
You could use a similar strategy if you want to highlight particular data

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.750
points in a graphic.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.670
Perhaps you've come across some good and not so

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.059
good examples of color use in data visualizations.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.220
I'd like you to go grab a data visualization from the wild, be it the internet,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.420
a newspaper, magazine, or perhaps even a scientific paper.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.920
I want you to describe how color is used in the graphic, and whether or

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.650
not you think the use of color is effective.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.430
Maybe you can think of some ways the designer might have done something else.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.520
Share your example on the discussion thread titled, Communicating with Color.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.140
In your post, describe how color is used.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.650
And how it encodes data, or maybe it's doing something else instead.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.940
