00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.775
That means that in terms of x, we remember x is the depth of her stage. Our

00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:12.021
equation for reverb time is this: T equals 0.322 times 6 x squared, times x

00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:18.634
plus 10, all over 22 x squared plus 100 x. This is a rational function. Now, as

00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:21.672
we've done with other rational functions, let's factor the numerator and

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:25.812
denominator. Write the fully factored forms of each side of the fraction here

00:00:25.812 --> 00:00:29.640
and here. I'd also like you to make a note of any values of x for which the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.989
function isn't defined.
