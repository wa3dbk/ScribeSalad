00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So now we want to actually look at the solver of order 2,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the method invented by Karl Heun, Heun's method.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It also goes under the name of improved Euler's method.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And it is also is one example for a simple Runge-Kutta method in case we haven't got that term.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll start with the forward Euler method.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The position for the first time step is the initial position plus time step times the initial velocity

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and similarly for the velocity, the velocity is changed by time step times force divided by mass

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Force divided by mass is acceleration.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I have explicitly indicated the dependence of the force on time and position.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And what we do now, we do not actually use these results for the next step,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we use them as stepping stones if you will.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let's start this result as Xe for Euler and this result is Ve for Euler

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and the trick now is to use these into immediate result

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to get a better estimate for the next x and the next v.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So how can I improve the estimate for the next position based on Euler's result?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And the next position is the initial position plus time step

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
times the average of the initial velocity and the next velocity as predicted by Euler.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This takes care of the fact that the velocity is not going to stay constant

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
over the cause of the first time step.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Euler's method is based on the assumption that this velocity is almost constant.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
How can I use this to improve Euler's result?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The bad thing about Euler's method is that the velocity actually is not constant.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It's not going to stay at the value it has at time equals zero.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
A better estimate is use the initial velocity and the velocity predicted by Euler

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and form the average of both.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
This is what Heun's method does and similarly for the acceleration used to compute the next velocity,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I found the average of the initial acceleration F at times zero divided by m

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and the force after the first time step at the position predicted by the Euler method.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
For the velocities, I'm using a similar approach.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I formed the average of two forces and divided by m to get acceleration.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The first force is the initial force times zero, initial position.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The second force is the force that I get at the end of the first time step

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
using the position predicted by Euler's method.
