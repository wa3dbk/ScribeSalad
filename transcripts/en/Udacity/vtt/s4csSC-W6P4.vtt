00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.540
You'll also notice in the sample code that we

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.150
have lines that call log.e, which log error messages. With

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.920
the adb command line tool and with the device plugged

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.580
in, you can type adb logcat to see the debug

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.770
and error messages that are being printed to the logcat.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.610
For more details on the logcat options, see the link

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.670
below. Another way to view the logs, is to use

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.610
Android Studio. If you click on the Screen Android button,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.486
it launches the Android Device Monitor. Which includes the

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.950
DDMS tool that Rado mentioned earlier. Then click on a

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.400
device and you can see that our app here, is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.580
a running process. If you click on the LogCat tab,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.000
then you all these log messages here, which is what

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.010
we saw with adb logcat. Now try viewing the logs

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.910
yourself with either of those methods. If you do both,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.950
then you get brownie points. Check this box to proceed.
