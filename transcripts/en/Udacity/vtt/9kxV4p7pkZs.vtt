We've neglected our poor drinking bird. Even though we've had techniques for a

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.605
while now to give him everything he needs, he is missing eyes, a nose, and, most

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:11.224
importantly, a crossbar to keep his body attached to his legs. Well, in computer

00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:14.122
graphics we could have him just hover in the air forever, but we're trying to

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:17.934
make things look a bit realistic. The specifications are in the code itself, as

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:21.620
comments at the end of the fill scene method. Don't be surprised if you have to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.250
add an object 3-D here and there to get all the transforms you need. Once you've

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.436
done adding these features, he should look like this. Now he has a cross bar

00:00:28.436 --> 00:00:29.463
eyes and a nose.
