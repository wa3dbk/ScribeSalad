00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is no, that's not correct at all.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I've been cheating a little along the way in that I've been showing you solutions

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that I got the second or third time once I'd debugged them and got them right.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This time I wanted to show you a little bit of the debugging process.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I got something wrong here. I don't always get them right the first time.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is so wrong looks what's happening.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I said the first move is at the 5 and the 2 go across together.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It seems like a perfectly reasonable move. They're going from here to there.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The second move was that the 1, by his or herself, comes back from there to here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But 1 isn't even over there. How could 1 come back?

00:00:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I must have messed up the successor function. Let's take a look.
