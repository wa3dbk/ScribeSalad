00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.340
Now it's your turn to add the functionality to

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.360
create conferences, to your application. First though, you need to

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.130
copy over some files into your project. In the

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.240
lesson four folder, you'll find Conference.java, and you're going to need

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.800
to copy it into the domain package, in your

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.340
project. And you can just drag and drop it from

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.230
wherever you downloaded it, right into the domain package

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.260
in Eclipse. Also, go ahead and copy over the ConferenceForm.java

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.340
file and put it in the form

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.780
package. Conference.java and ConferenceForm.java files contain completed code,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.630
but don't worry, we haven't done everything for

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.020
you. You're going to need to copy the skeleton

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.200
version of createConferences into the conference API class,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.710
and it's going to be your job to finish

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.000
implementing, the createConference function. After you drag and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.310
drop your files into Eclipse, you're going to

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.790
need to refresh your project. Go ahead and right-click on

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.050
the project name and then you choose Refresh, and then your

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.520
project will refresh, and it'll show the files that you just

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.460
copied over. If you forget to refresh it, you might not

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.519
see the files, and then you might be in a

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.880
panic where they are. So, remember to refresh. When you've copied

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.190
the files and the function into your project, go ahead and

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.270
have a look at the Conference.java file and the ConferenceForm.java. So

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.680
now, here's a quick question for

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.710
you. Does ConferenceForm have properties that map

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.381
to these properties in Conference? Does

00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:26.720
ConferenceForm have a property, that maps to

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.659
the name property in Conference? Does it have a property that maps to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.970
the topics property in Conference? And so on. So, just check all that apply.
