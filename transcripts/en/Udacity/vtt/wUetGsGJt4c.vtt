00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.940
Now, I'm sure you've noticed many different areas of the brain are involved in

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.886
memory. When it comes to long term memory explicit and implicit memories are

00:00:06.886 --> 00:00:12.237
stored in different areas. Explicit memories are taken in from the prefrontal

00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:16.654
cortex and processed in the hippocampus. Then they're returned to the area

00:00:16.654 --> 00:00:21.160
where the sensory information was originally processed. [INAUDIBLE]. So, for

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.680
example, your explicit visual memory would be stored in the occipital lobe,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.310
whereas, for example, your explicit memory about the way something felt would

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.731
be stored in this sensory cortex. And the auditory memories would be stored in

00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:37.650
the auditory cortex. Implicit memories are processed and stored in their

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.786
cortexes. As well as the straitum, amygdala, and cerebellum.
