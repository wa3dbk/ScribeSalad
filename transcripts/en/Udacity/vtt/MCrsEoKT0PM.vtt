00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.220
Now here's a very important and subtle
point about the completion of a wait.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.980
When wait returns, the only thing that
you know is that buf is safe to reuse.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.840
If the handle is for

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.520
a receive, then it must mean
that the message was delivered.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.340
But what about send?

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.490
For a send, buffer being available for
use doesn't really tell you anything.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.360
For instance it could mean the message
was delivered since the wave

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.600
might actually wait until
the message is delivered, but

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.660
it doesn't have to mean that.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.670
In fact it might not even be the case
that the message is even in flight yet.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.750
The precise action is
implementation dependent.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.290
Implementation dependent.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.260
But why?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.270
The answer has to do with buffering
implied by these primitives.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.680
Remember that the processes
are executing asynchronously.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.700
Also remember that a send completes when
the caller may reuse the message buffer.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.660
So let's imagine what might happen.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.020
Here are two ranks, i and j.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.840
Rank i is computing, and
then decides to send a message to j.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.310
In the meantime, j is running
off asynchronously for a long,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.660
long time before it decides, oh,
I'm ready to receive a message from i.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.850
So the send could arrive way before
the receive is actually ready.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.700
So should the send stop and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.690
wait until the receive has been
posted before it starts delivering?

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.500
In this scenario, rank i would
have to wait a long, long time.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.160
What rank i might do
instead is make a copy and

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.300
then later on decide
to start the delivery.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.860
That way rank i can kind of keep going.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.940
So by leaving the meaning of the
completion of a send a little bit loose,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.840
you give more freedom to the
implementation to make a good trade off.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.490
Okay, so
what's the punchline of all this?

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.430
Well, it means that when you're
trying to determine if your algorithm

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.720
is correct,
meaning that a sent message is received,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.059
you need to prove that for every posted
send, there is a matching receive.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.422
This protocol that sends, match,
receives is called two-sided messaging.

00:02:00.422 --> 00:02:03.230
Two-sided suggests there
might be a one sided, and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.330
in fact that's kind of what
shared memory communication is.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.200
I'll let you think about that.
