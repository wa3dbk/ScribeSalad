00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.960
At the end of the quiz before this one, we said that a correct equation to

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:10.073
describe this situation is that each month would be money Grant spends each

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:15.210
month equals 6.5 times number of wiper sets made, plus 1200. All we need to do

00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:20.322
now is replace number of wiper sets made with x, and money Grant spends each

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:25.502
month with $5685. So again, as we've done many times before, this is just a

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:30.728
simple case of substitution. And we come up with an equation of 5,685 equals

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.804
6.5x plus 1,200.
