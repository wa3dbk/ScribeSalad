00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.198
Up to this point our requests
have been working fine, but

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:05.970
there's potentially
a big security problem.

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:09.200
If you've been paying attention,
our requests for

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.770
this app are being sent using HTTP.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.710
We can see this if we go
to the app constants file.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.300
We notice that our API scheme is HTTP.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.400
And this scheme is what's being used,
here we go,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.290
in the tndbURLFromParameters that's
using our ApiScheme, which is HTTP.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.690
Now, while we've defined
the proper settings

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.410
in the info.plist file to allow for
this, there's still a big security risk.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.086
Especially if we're making
requests that send usernames and

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:48.351
passwords as parameters of URL,
like we did when we logged into the API.

00:00:49.705 --> 00:00:50.835
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:54.145
Let's go back to
the LoginViewController and

00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:57.605
let's find that loginWithToken method,
here we go.

00:00:57.605 --> 00:00:59.875
Let's add a print statement
that shows the URL for

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:05.150
the login request that we're making and
our loginWithToken method.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.660
When I click the login button,
okay here's our URL, so

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.490
I've clicked the login button and
we can see that the URL's being

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.810
printed where the username and
password are sent as plain text.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.110
So if somebody was watching the network
traffic going from my phone to a server,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.240
or even from my simulator to a server,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.660
they could see these values and
this is obviously very bad.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.050
Let me show you how this might look for

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.950
somebody who's snooping
on network traffic.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.640
I'm going to do this using
an application called Charles.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.360
You don't need to install Charles
yourself, I'm just going to use it for

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.530
this example.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.050
In Charles we can see all the web
traffic that's incoming and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.410
outgoing on this particular machine.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.040
So I want to see the requests that are
being sent to the movie database, and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.150
as you can see,
we've made a request recently.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.350
If I select this request and
then I go look at the summary,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.040
I can actually see what the traffic
looks like as it's leaving my machine.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.450
So I can take a closer look, and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.340
here's our validate_with_login method,
I can actually see my username here, and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.370
then here's my password in plain
daylight for everyone to see.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.490
So we definitely need to fix this,
but thankfully,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.465
it can be done really quickly
since the movie database provides

00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:12.725
us a way to send requests
like these securely.

00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:17.725
If we go back to the documentation
we can take a look at this HTTPS/SSL

00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:22.225
section and, as we can see, it simply
tells us instead of making an HTTP

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:26.500
call ,we just need to make
an HTTPS call, and then we're set.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.880
What this is effectively going to
do is by making the HTTPS calls,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.443
it's going to encrypt all the data
that's being sent from our apps so

00:02:33.443 --> 00:02:34.927
that nobody can snoop on us.

00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:38.506
If you want to hear more about HTTPS,
now I put a link in the instructor notes

00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:41.760
to our web development
discussions on the topic.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.880
Okay, so to fix the problem we
just need to make one small change

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.190
in the constants.swf file.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.170
Let's change our scheme
from HTTP to HTTPS.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.660
Now we'll build this project.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:56.755
Let's go and log in.

00:02:56.755 --> 00:03:00.415
Now I'll go ahead and switch back over
to Charles and you'll see that we have

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:05.455
the HTTP request that we previously
did and then these HTTPS requests.

00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:09.145
And as you can see, since we're using
https, we don't really know anything

00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:11.855
in terms of snooping about
what's happening in our request,

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:15.695
whereas we can still see things that
are being passed with this request.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.165
The best part about all of this is
we're pretty much getting it all for

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:21.740
free because the movie
database supports HTTPS.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.385
So, when in doubt, just use HTTPS.
