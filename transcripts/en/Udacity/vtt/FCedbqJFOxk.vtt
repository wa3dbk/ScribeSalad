00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.748
For you first encounter with actual WebGL and 3js code, I'll give you a simple

00:00:04.748 --> 00:00:08.528
program that creates a scene with one object, a cube. And a few grids

00:00:08.528 --> 00:00:12.122
surrounding it. To see it, however, you'll have to get your hands dirty and fix

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:15.816
a few syntax errors. In the code, to the left of the lines that have problems,

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:20.295
you'll see little marks that denote that you need to fix those lines. Make the

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:24.507
corrections, and then try doing the test run, and you should see this. Once you

00:00:24.507 --> 00:00:27.822
fix the three syntax errors in the program, you should see something like this

00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:32.128
on your screen. Note that you can interact with it. You can move around, zoom

00:00:32.128 --> 00:00:36.042
and pan. Try the various mouse controls to see how it works. If you get things

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:39.743
into a broken state, just refresh the page on your browser. Once you've got the

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:44.010
program running, try changing numbers in the code to see the effect. Don't worry

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.390
about what the code's doing at this point, I'll be covering that in the lessons

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.036
ahead. More importantly, I'll be explaining the underlying physical principles

00:00:51.036 --> 00:00:52.629
and mathematics behind this code.
