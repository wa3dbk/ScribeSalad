00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.670
To have a good understanding of a file systems, we need

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.870
to know how application developers interact with it. There are two

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.010
main ways of doing this. One way, keeps track of a

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.320
position or cursor in the file, and as we read or

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.880
write to the file, we move the cursor around. The other

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.580
way allows us to treat a file, as though just a

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.760
block of memory. Let's cover the position-based strategy first. We begin

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.740
by opening the file, with the open procedure, specifying how we intend

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.415
to use it, with some flags. Notice that I'm using the

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:33.100
lower-level system calls, rather than C's built-in procedures like fopen, which

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.760
sometimes use an extra layer of buffering. It's not that the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.240
extra layer's a bad idea, I just want to interact more

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.460
directly with the operating system. Having opened the file, we can

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.940
then call read or write as we wish. Write, I should

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.910
say, overwrites instead of inserting, as the cursor does by default

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.890
in most editors. And as we read and write, we move

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.020
the cursor through the file. If we want to move

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.560
the cursor without reading or writing, we use the lseek

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.590
command. Which repositions the cursor in the file. And finally

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.570
when we're done with the file we should close it,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.730
so that the file system knows we're done. Now I've

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.990
skipped over most of the details here, because I thought

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.250
it would be a lot more fun for you to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.590
learn them on your own, with a little programming exercise.
