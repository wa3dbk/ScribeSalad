00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:07.599
So now let's step back a little bit and look at pre-processing in general. So you've already figured out three pre-processing rules for SAT.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.632
And what I would like you to think about now is, in general, if we think about pre-processing,

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:17.866
what are the requirements that we would have for a pre-processing algorithm?

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:21.499
And of course, since we're defining pre-processing, I write requirements here in brackets

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.532
because it has a somewhat subjective component. But here's the three choices:

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.799
So what would be kind of good requirements for pre-processing?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.832
The first one is that it must run in polynomial time; the second one is that pre-processing should always speed up the running time,

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:42.766
which means it would speed up the worst-case running time. And the third one is that pre-processing should not affect the solution.

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:48.799
By this, I mean that pre-processing does not change if we get a yes or a no as a result.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.132
If we have an optimization problem, it's the same. So if, for example, we're solving vertex cover

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:57.199
and we're finding a solution of size ten, then after pre-processing, of course,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.332
we would also like that solution size to remain the same and not get a solution of 11 or 12.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:07.033
So please check which of these three here would be very sensible requirements for pre-processing.
