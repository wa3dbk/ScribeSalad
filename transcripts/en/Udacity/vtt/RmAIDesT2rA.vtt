00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.330
Over the next four lessons, we'll
discuss two very important problems.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.570
Finding a maximum flow on a graph and

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.380
solving a linear
programming optimization.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.120
These problems are P-complete, meaning
that any problem that can be solved on

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.760
a Turing machine in polynomial time, can
be turned into one of these problems.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.310
We will also see an important restricted
case in the bipartite matching problem.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.060
And then we'll explore the connections
among all these problems,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.390
in a discussion of the principal of
duality, which is the inspiration for

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.150
a large class of
approximation algorithms.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.870
In this first lesson,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.420
we discuss the problem of finding
a maximum flow through a network.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.810
A network here is essentially
anything that can be modeled

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.400
as a directive graph.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.260
And by flow, we mean the movement
of some stuff through a medium,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.990
from some designated
source to a destination.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.400
Typically we want to maximize the flow.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.070
That is to say,
we want to route as many packets

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.960
as possible from one computer
across a network to another, or

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.449
we want to ship as many items
from our factories to our stores.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.400
Even if we don't actually want to move
as much as possible across the network,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.980
understanding the maximum flow can
give us important information.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.050
For instance, in communication networks,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.480
it tells us something about how
robust we are to link failures.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.450
And even more abstractly, maximum flow
problems can help us figure out things

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.130
that seem unrelated to networks.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.299
Like, which teams have been eliminated
playoff contention in sports.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.740
Given the variety and importance of
these applications, it should be no

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.760
surprise that maximum flow problems
have been studied extensively, and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.440
we have some sophisticated and
elegant algorithms for solving them.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.940
Let's dive in.
