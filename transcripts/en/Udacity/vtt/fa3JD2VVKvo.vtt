00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.624
The relationship between these two functions we've been talking about has a

00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:08.636
special name. They are inverse functions of one another. As I said before, just

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:11.964
looking at these equations, you might not have any idea right off the bat that

00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:16.750
these functions are inverses. To help make that more clear immediately, there's

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.294
a special notation we can use. Let's say that we have a function that we're

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:25.663
calling f. Then if f has an inverse, we can write that inverse like this, f

00:00:25.663 --> 00:00:30.628
with a little negative 1 up here to the right. Now we have to be super careful,

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:37.062
when we use this notation. This does not, I repeat, does not mean 1 over f. The

00:00:37.062 --> 00:00:41.384
negative 1 here is not an exponent. You read this as f inverse, not f to the

00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:46.048
negative 1. To make sure that we're keeping everything straight. Now, let's

00:00:46.048 --> 00:00:51.875
suppose that f, in this case, is f of x equals 3x minus 1. Right away, we can

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:56.390
plug in values for x to figure out different points on the line. I'll just pick

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.843
out a few for right now. We have 0 comma negative 1. 1 comma 2, and negative 1

00:01:01.843 --> 00:01:06.527
comma negative 4. We don't know the equation for the inverse of f quite yet,

00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:09.587
but we do know that we can denote it like this, and we actually know quite a

00:01:09.587 --> 00:01:15.320
bit more information about this, because of these points here. Based on the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.785
information we have about the function f, what points do we know will lie on f

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:23.335
inverse? Below each of these points that lie on f, Please write the

00:01:23.335 --> 00:01:26.349
corresponding points on f inverse.
