00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.734
The answer is that the first one
is false and the rest are true.

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:09.228
The first one is false because
a a b a is not from sigma star,

00:00:09.228 --> 00:00:11.480
it's from gamma star.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.520
In the order here of say,
gamma star and sigma star matters.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.970
If we were to reverse these,
then it would be in the language.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.470
b is in sigma star b.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.730
Because the empty string
is in sigma star.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.710
And we can concatenate that with b,
to get b.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.860
Sigma union gamma is the set
of strings 0, 1, a, and b.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.710
So applying star to that gives us
all strings over all those symbols

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.520
including this one here.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.790
And finally, because the empty
string is not in gamma plus,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.340
it is in the complement of gamma plus.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.750
So this statement is true as well.
