00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.580
So we said we were going to
have controls in place,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.560
that we're going to have
people responsible,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.640
we're going to have policy to inform
people of our do's and don'ts and

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.540
things like that, but that's not
going to reduce our risk to zero.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.805
There's still the possibility,
because there are non-vulnerabilities,

00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:18.965
where people became victims
of a phishing attack,

00:00:18.965 --> 00:00:21.725
we hear about those on a regular basis.

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:25.885
So the risk is not going to go down to
zero, something could still go wrong,

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:31.015
despite having the best planning and
best management for cyber security.

00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:32.185
So if there is a risk,

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:36.575
how do we sort of get a sense of how
much risk is that we still have?

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:38.640
What kind of risk are we dealing with?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.110
Assessing such risk is important
because we talked about cost benefit.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.720
So if you're going to make
investment in cyber security,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.370
those investment decisions have to
be based on risk and its reduction.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.650
So you're going to pay for
a certain control.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.250
How much is the risk being reduced?

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.920
And they say risk is going to be reduced
because it's never going to be zero.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.790
The only way to make it zero is you
disconnect from the rest of the world.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.910
But then you can't do anything useful.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.520
So some risk is going to remain,
and if the risk remains, well,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.440
how do you quantify it if your
investments are going to be based?

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.430
Investments passed a certain control,
what are you going to pay for it?

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.000
Certainly, there's a number.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.400
So if you're assessing risk or
quantifying it, how exactly do you?

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.290
It'll be great to say,
this is my risk and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.380
this is what I can do to deal with it,
but how do you assess risk?

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.900
And one of the things we're
going to find out is that

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.940
quantifying it is actually not easy.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.930
There are various frameworks
to sort of see what you do or

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.220
don't do that may pose
some degree of risk, but

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.670
actually quantifying it is what is hard,
so that's what we're talking about.
