00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.131
Let's define some terms for various camera moves. Here's a top down drawing of

00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:08.680
a viewer and an object. When you adjust the field of view, that's zoom. When

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.470
you move directly towards or away from an object you're looking at, that's

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.417
dollying, it's not zooming. I have a zoom on my camera does not mean, if I want

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:19.914
to make something larger, I run toward it and I yell zoom. It's so easy in

00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:23.316
computer graphics to either zoom in or dolly in, that they're sometimes not

00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:27.782
that easy to tell apart. However, they're certainly different in their effect

00:00:27.782 --> 00:00:31.402
on the camera's field of view and location. The one giveaway that you're

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:35.890
dollying and not zooming is that if new faces become visible or disappear.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.730
Zooming changes the size of the image scene, but does not change visibility.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.568
All that said, I'll sometimes say zoom in, when the controls are actually dolly

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:46.880
controls, just because most people don't know what dolly in means. The camera

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.280
controls for most of the programs in this course have the mouse wheel and

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.370
middle mouse button set to dolly the view in and out. The other common camera

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.054
moves are panning and orbiting. Panning means moving left or right as you keep

00:00:57.054 --> 00:01:00.956
the camera pointed forward. For most programs we're using, the right mouse

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:05.030
button pans. Orbitting means circling around the target position, similar to

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.031
how a satellite orbits the earth. For those of you into first person shooters,

00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:12.250
it's circle strafing a target. The target location is often placed at the

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.326
center of whatever object is to be examined. In most of our programs, left

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:20.094
mouse orbits around a target location. Incidentally all these mouse moves are

00:01:20.094 --> 00:01:23.700
just what we happen to use. There are no iron clad standards among programs

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.690
about which mouse button does what.
