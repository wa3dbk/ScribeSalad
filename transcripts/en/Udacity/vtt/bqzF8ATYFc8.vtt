00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.335
You may have heard about special right triangles before. They're special,

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:07.310
because they have a 90 degree angle for one of their angles. We're going to

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.556
take a closer look at this one. It's a 3, 4, 5 right triangle. We call it that,

00:00:12.556 --> 00:00:18.500
since the ratio of the legs is 3 to 4 and the hypotenuse is 5. The legs are

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.258
just the sides of the triangle that form the right angle. And the hypotenuse is

00:00:22.258 --> 00:00:26.938
the side that is directly across from the 90 degree angle. Not only is the

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:30.394
hypotenuse across from the 90 degree angle, it's also the longest side of the

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:34.778
entire triangle. We're going to look at an interesting relationship between the

00:00:34.778 --> 00:00:39.298
legs of the triangle and the hypotenuse. I'm going to shrink the triangle, and

00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:46.150
then I'm going to draw boxes off of each of the legs and the hypotenuse. These

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.498
boxes are actually squares, so this square has side lengths of three, this

00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:54.587
square has side lengths of four, and this square has side lengths of five. What

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:59.480
I want you to do is to tell me the area of each of these squares. You can type

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.960
those numbers here.
