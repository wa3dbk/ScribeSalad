00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.290
So how do we test out how our

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.480
desktop application works with a touch interface if

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.800
we don't have a mobile device handy? Well

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.780
it turns out that Chrome developer tools let us

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.310
use the mouse to emulate touch event support

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.900
on a non-touch desktop. Just open up the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.470
Chrome developer tools, go down to this gear

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.680
down at the bottom And under Overrides, select Enable,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.590
and Emulate touch events. Now, close the overrides, but be sure to leave

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.470
the dev tools open, you can minimize them to get them out of

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.735
the way. And now, as you move across your interface you'll see the

00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:44.905
cursor represented by a small dot, this is emulating a touch event cursor.

00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:48.813
[MUSIC]

00:00:48.813 --> 00:00:52.113
And clicking the mouse is the same as pushing your finger down, or

00:00:52.113 --> 00:00:55.880
lifting it off. Now, you don't want to rely on this too much, it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.540
isn't perfect and it isn't exactly like having a real touch interface. So be

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.680
sure to test on a real touch interface and a mobile device as well.
