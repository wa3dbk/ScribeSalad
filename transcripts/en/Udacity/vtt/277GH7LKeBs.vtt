00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
And I would ague that all three arguments here are in a way correct.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.260
So you could argue that randomization is more powerful than determinism.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.350
Of course, we don't know why and we don't know if that is so,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.890
but it could be a valid reason that somehow randomization is a bit more effective

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.090
but I think you could argue that randomization is in a way

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.210
or that randomization could in a way be a bit more effective than determinism.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.950
After all, you're not really saying how much more effective,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.250
but maybe you gain a little edge through trying randomization.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.090
Of course it could also be that simply no one has had the right idea yet

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.620
how to design a really really good deterministic algorithm for 3-SAT.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.830
Of course, the links of the table that I've just shown you suggest

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.580
that people have put a lot of thought into this but maybe tomorrow,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.820
somebody comes up with a really good idea for a comparably

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.000
fast exponential time algorithm for 3-SAT, and finally, I think this is also an important point,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.520
it could be that analyzing deterministic algorithms is just way more complex

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.050
than analyzing the randomized ones.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.590
The 3-SAT algorithm, the randomized one that I've shown you

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.570
with a running time of 1.334^n  some polynomial is very very simple

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.940
and it's analysis is also not that complicated.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.910
For the deterministic algorithms, however, you have to go through

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.710
a lot and lot and lot of analysis to prove those bounds.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.890
So, it could be that you could modify some deterministic algorithm

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.700
to be better than the randomized one but simply the analysis required to do so, is much more complex

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.650
and by analysis, I really mean that you don't really have to modify the algorithm that much

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.810
but just look at its performance a little more closely.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.000
So, there are couple of reasons why the randomized 3-SAT algorithms

00:01:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
could be better than the deterministic ones, but of course, we don't know for sure.
