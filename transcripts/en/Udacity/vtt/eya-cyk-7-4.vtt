Okay, here's an example of a decision problem that comes up in social network analysis

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and that's the clique problem.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Remember clique is a set of nodes in a network that are all pairwise connected--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
everybody in the group knows everybody else in the group.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We were given a graph G and a number k, let's say 4, and we're asked--is there a clique of size k in G.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So remember clique is a connective set of nodes--so for example 1, 3, 4 is a three clique,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but now the question is--is there a four clique in the graph.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So just to make sure that you understand the idea of this problem,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
why don't you find the four clique--there is a four clique in this graph.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Find the four clique, add the node numbers that make up the clique together,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and enter the answer in the box.
