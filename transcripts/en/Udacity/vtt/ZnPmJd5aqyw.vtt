00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.046
What I'm going to do next is to introduce a few additional

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:06.350
coverage criteria using a slightly more complex example, but still a

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.370
pretty simple one. What I'm showing here is a program that

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.145
reads two real numbers, x and y. And then, if x

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.148
is equal to 0 or y is greater than 0, it

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:19.360
computes y as y divided by x. Otherwise, it computes x

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.110
as y plus 2, then it writes the value of x,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.730
the value of y, and it terminates. Let's also introduce a CFG

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.160
for the program. As you can see, the CFG represents the statements

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.900
in the code and their control flow. And in this case, I made

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.800
explicit over the branches what are the conditions under which those branches

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.530
are taken to make it simpler to look at the example. Let's assume

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.280
that we have two tests for this code that are shown here.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.286
For the first one, the inputs are 5 and 5. For the second

00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:47.610
one, 5 and minus 5. If we consider branch coverage for this code

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.990
and we consider the two test cases, for the first one this condition

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.440
is true. Because x is not equal to 0 but y

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.660
is greater than 0. And therefore, we will follow this tree branch.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.640
For the second one, the condition is false. Because x is not

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.200
equal to 0 and y is not greater than 0. Therefore, the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.990
negation of it is true and we will follow this branch. In

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.530
other words, these two test cases achieve 100% branch coverage on this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.120
code. If we look at the code though, we can see that

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.879
there is the possibility of making this code fail. Consider this statement,

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:18.147
if x is equal to 0, we could have a division

00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:21.710
by 0. However, these two test cases, despite the fact that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.008
they achieved 100% branch coverage, will not rebuild this problem. So

00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:27.564
how can we be more thorough? I'll let you think about it

00:01:27.564 --> 00:01:29.964
for a second, so think about how can we test more

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:33.260
thoroughly, in a more complete way, this code. So, in a way

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.220
that goes beyond branch coverage. And the answer is that we

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.250
can make each condition true and false. Instead of just considering the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.570
whole predicate here. And that's exactly what is required by

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.480
the next criteria that we're going to consider which is condition

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.880
coverage. We're going to define it as usual in terms of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.070
test requirements and coverage measure. In this case, the test

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.540
requirements for condition coverage are the individual conditions in the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.510
program. So we want each condition in the program to

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.900
be both true and false first time execution. So the

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.420
way in which we can measure that is by measuring the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.150
number of conditions that were both true and false

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.580
when we executed our tests over the total number

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.180
of conditions. And that gives us the percentage of

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.270
coverage that we achieved for condition coverage. Again, if you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.638
want to look at this criteria in the form

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.245
of a question. The question would be, has each boolean

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:25.480
sub-expression, which means every condition in every predicate, evaluated

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.010
both to true and false when we run our tests.
