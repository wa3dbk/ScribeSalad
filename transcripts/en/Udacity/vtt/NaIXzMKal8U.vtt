00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.920
Protecting sensitive health data
divides into three sub areas.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.700
Privacy in health care means
that only individuals or

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.200
entities authorized by the patient
may have access to their data.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.130
So a patient's record may be stored
digitally in the EHR of a hospital, but

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.730
that doesn't mean anyone in
the hospital can access it.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.120
It can only be accessed by people
authorized for specific purposes.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.640
Security is preventing
unauthorized access to the data by

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.650
outsiders such as hackers.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.020
This is a particular concern
where data is being shared.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.030
Just as with financial records,
health data has value and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.750
must be protected at all times and
in all places where it resides.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.990
Trust means knowing
that the individual or

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.850
entity with whom is being shared
is who they say they are.
