00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.969
Finally, you're ready
to launch your cluster.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.040
On the name node,
format the file system.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.890
Then star hdfs.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.520
Since the name known as connecting
to the data node for the first time,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.590
it might ask you if you
want to continue connecting.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.500
Say yes.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.206
Sometimes it might hang
without another prompt.

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:19.851
Just type in yes again, and get going.

00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:22.718
You can check that your node are running
by going to the named nodes web

00:00:22.718 --> 00:00:24.600
interface in a browser.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.300
You can get there with the name node
public host name on port five zero zero

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.720
seven zero.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.220
Okay, this is what I see.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.640
And here,
we see we have three live nodes.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.400
These are the data nodes.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.348
Now Start yarn.

00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:40.518
And finally, start the jobbers.

00:00:40.518 --> 00:00:45.034
And finally,
start the job history server.

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:47.219
Now you can see the daemons running.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.670
On the name node enter JPS.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.500
Here you see the JobHistoryServer
SecondaryNameNode NameNode and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.690
a ResourceManager.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.370
These are all daemone that are running
on the name node computer.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.209
And on the data node, you see
a NodeManager and the DataNode daemone.
