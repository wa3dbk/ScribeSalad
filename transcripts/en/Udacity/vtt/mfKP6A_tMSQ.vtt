00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.370
One of the key ideas is that we need to solve for the original variable. We

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.000
solved for u here, but our equation started with m. We made the substitution u

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.965
equals 4m minus 3, so we can use that to our advantage to find the value of n,

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:19.880
based on our answers. So, I want you to use your answers of u equals negative 5

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.764
halves and u equals negative 1 to find the original values for m. What do you

00:00:25.764 --> 00:00:29.310
think they'd be? When you've got them, write your answer as a set.
