00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.550
One more topic before we finish
up with drawing, and that's text.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.890
Text is actually a super
complicated topic.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.780
So we're just going to do
the minimum necessary to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.910
get some text on the screen.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.830
First thing, text in LibGDX
is actually made of bitmaps.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.860
That means instead of describing
the shape of the characters,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.270
we describe the actual pixels
that make up the text.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.930
We'll discuss bitmaps and
textures in more detail later on, but

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.930
the short version is just that we use a
SpriteBatch instead of a shape renderer.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.320
Everything else is almost identical.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.080
So in this demo,
we'll create our SpriteBatch and

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.730
we'll use just the default bitmap font.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.980
Then we'll set the scale so
the font appears a little bit bigger and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.370
then we need to set the filter.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.310
Now texture filtering is
a complicated topic all on it's own.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.130
We'll talk more about that later.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.530
But it's how we determine what a bitmap
looks like when the bitmap gets drawn at

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.440
a larger size than it was
originally designed to be drawn at.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.470
This linear filter makes sure that the
text doesn't look all pixellated when we

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.880
draw it large.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.900
Sprite batches and fonts need to be
disposed of, just like a ShapeRenderer.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.710
Finally down in renderer,
we clear the screen just like normal.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.370
We begin a batch of the sprite batch

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.150
just like with a shape renderer
except there's no mode.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.230
Then to actually draw, we call draw on
the font object passing in the batch,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.530
the text we want to draw and
the position.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.580
Also remember to end
your sprite batches.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.480
And there we go,
we've got Text on the screen.
