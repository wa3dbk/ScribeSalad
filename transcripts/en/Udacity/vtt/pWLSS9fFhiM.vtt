00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.000
In packet switching, the information for forwarding traffic

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.748
is contained in the destination address of every

00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:08.230
datagram or packet. Similar to how you would

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.330
write a letter and specify the destination to where

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.260
you want the letter sent, and that letter

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.610
might wend its way through multiple intermediate post

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.240
offices en-route to the recipient, packet switching works

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.380
much the same way. There is no state established

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.900
ahead of time. And there are very few

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.190
assumptions made about the level of service that the

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.170
network provides. This assumption about the level of service

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.360
that the network provides, is sometimes called best effort.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.440
So how does packet switching enable sharing. Just as

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.254
if you were sending a letter. Many senders can

00:00:44.254 --> 00:00:46.696
send over the same network at the same time,

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:50.770
effectively sharing the resources in the network. A similar

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.150
phenomenon occurs in packet switching when multiple

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.450
senders send network traffic or packets over the

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.500
same set of shared network links. Now this

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.630
is in contrast to the phone network. Where

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.720
if you were to make a phone call, the resources for the path between you and

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.020
the recipient are dedicated and are allocated until

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.830
the phone call ends. The mode of switching

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.360
that the conventional phone network uses is

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.430
called circuit switching. Where a signalling protocol

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.030
sets up the entire path out-of-band. So

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.890
this notion of packet switching and statistical multiplexing

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.330
allowing multiple users to share a resource

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.630
at the same time was really revolutionary.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.090
And it is one of the underlying

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.490
design principles of the internet that has persisted.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.380
Now, an advantage of statistical multiplexing

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.340
of the links and the network, means

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.890
that the sender never gets a busy

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.120
signal. The drawbacks include things like variable

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.440
delay and the potential for lost or

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.690
dropped packets. In contrast, circuit switching provides

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.780
resource control, better accounting and reservation of

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.740
resources and the ability to pin paths

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.949
between a sender and receiver. Packet switching provides the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:14.150
ability to share resources and potentially better resilience properties.
