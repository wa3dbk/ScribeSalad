Ã¯Â»Â¿Student Chainsaw Riot asks what does it mean to be pythonic?

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.525
Wow, Chainsaw Riot. Okay.

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:13.973
So, pythonic is a word that sort of describes the way you would do things in python,

00:00:13.973 --> 00:00:16.279
if you were an expert python programmer

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.833
and we have mostly not tried to do things in the most pythonic way in this class

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:24.739
because I want to keep the subset of python we use as small as possible.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.002
So many of things weÃ¢Â€Â™ve done, there are very clever ways to do them in python,

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.929
which would take advantage of features we donÃ¢Â€Â™t see.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.149
One that comes to mind was a student posted a solution to the Sudoko problem.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.305
That was a fantastic one line solution

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:41.284
that used a few things we hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t covered in the class

00:00:41.284 --> 00:00:44.105
but if you want to see the pythonic way to solve problems,

00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:48.217
I would encourage you definitely to take Peter NorvigÃ¢Â€Â™s class, which is CS262.

00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:51.816
He is really a master at using python in a very clever way

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:55.933
and finding a way that solves problems that you would think would require

00:00:55.933 --> 00:01:01.174
hundreds of lines of code and then both by mostly clever thinking

00:01:01.174 --> 00:01:06.142
and clever ways of solving it but also using features of python in the best possible way

00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:08.936
finds a way to solve it in two or three lines

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:11.735
and so if youÃ¢Â€Â™re getting more experienced as a programmer,

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:14.462
you are going to be finding these very elegant short solutions

00:01:14.462 --> 00:01:18.462
that take advantage of more features in the language than we have used in CS101.
