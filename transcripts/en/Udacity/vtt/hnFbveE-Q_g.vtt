You may be surprised to learn that
collecting data in the home to help with

00:00:04.196 --> 00:00:06.820
care is actually quite an old idea.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.500
Here's a photo of Steve Kaufman, one
of the early innovators in this space,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.251
with his HANC, home assisted nursing
care robot, that offered a wide variety

00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:21.092
of voice controlled nursing services
to patients at home in the mid 1990s.

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:25.104
Among other things, it dispensed
medications at the proper time and

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:29.466
took physiologic measurements with
its patient operated devices based on

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.070
the technology of the day.
