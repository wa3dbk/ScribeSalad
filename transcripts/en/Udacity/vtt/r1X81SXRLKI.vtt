00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.428
I want to make one more note before finishing with this lesson. Remember how I

00:00:05.428 --> 00:00:09.637
said before that we could write this as muss of Q minus muss of A equals 0 for

00:00:09.637 --> 00:00:15.700
the hypothesis test. And likewise for the alternative hypothesis we can say

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.922
that the difference between them is not equal to 0. Instead of writing this as

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:25.610
a difference. We can just write muss of d, which means the difference between

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.530
these two population means. The null assumes that this difference will be 0,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.196
and the alternative assumes that they'll not be 0. Then instead of the

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:40.730
numerator we had before, we'll have the difference between the sample means.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.532
And then subtract 0. We're testing to see if this difference between the sample

00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:50.666
means, is significantly different from 0. However, we could see if this

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:55.151
difference between the sample means, is significantly different from any value,

00:00:55.151 --> 00:01:01.990
not just 0. Maybe we want to test if the difference between sample means is 6.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.740
Usually though, we're looking to see if the difference is different from 0.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.303
You'll get more practice with this notation in the problem sets. Great job.
