00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.940
One thing to keep in mind before we get involved in a situation that we do a

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.028
cost-benefit analysis. Let's say for example, I see two grown men fighting in

00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:12.720
the street. I'll stop and engage in a cost-benefit analysis and decide that if

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.602
I try to split the two men up by myself, I could possibly get hurt. And that's

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:21.315
something I wouldn't want to happen. Sometimes people don't offer assistance

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:25.710
because they fear the negative repercussions if they don't help adequately. Or

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.154
if they make a situation worse. But for now, let's go to Susan to talk more

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.360
about some pro-social behaviors.
