Now that we've seen a little bit about what goes into making text on the canvas,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.320
let's see if you can recreate that classic meme text.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.630
For this quiz,

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.360
I want you to draw the phrase canvas memes with that iconic meme typography.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.550
Your text must use letters that have a black outline and a white fill.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.380
You should use the Impact font, size 36 point,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.510
and the black outline around the text should have a width of 3 pixels.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.550
To learn more about how to set the font size and

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.670
get the outlines right, check the links in the instructor notes.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.480
