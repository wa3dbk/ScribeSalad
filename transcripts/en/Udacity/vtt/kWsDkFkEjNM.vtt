00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.225
Our first visualization comes from the World Cup.

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:05.830
We've been pretty jazzed about the World Cup in our office here.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.720
So, we thought this was pretty appropriate.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.000
You can find a link to this graphic, and then shut your notes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.620
Take a minute or

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.930
two to review the graphic, and ask them questions about the data.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.650
So, you can get a feel for how this graphic is working.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.790
Once you're ready, I'd like you to determine,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.920
how some of the variables are encoded visually, in the graphic.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.090
You'll choose one of these Visual Encodings, for one particular variable.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.050
So, for example, for Country, how is it encoded in the graphic?

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.970
Is it an angle?

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.050
Is it by length, orientation, or some other choice?

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.910
Write that answer in this box.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.630
And then choose another Visual Encoding for each of these other Variables.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.740
Be aware that you can choose multiple Visual Encodings for

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.100
each of the Variables.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.480
In other words, you can reuse a Visual Encoding, as an answer here.
