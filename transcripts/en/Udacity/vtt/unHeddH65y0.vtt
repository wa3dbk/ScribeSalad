00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.744
We can use the same approach when we multiply rational expressions. So, even

00:00:04.744 --> 00:00:08.898
something that looks really complicated like this, we can simplify to a smaller

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:12.841
fraction. First, we want to factor the numerators, and then factor the

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:16.352
denominators. Once we've done that step, we want to cancel or simplify the

00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:20.078
common factors that appear in the numerator and denominator, since they'll equal

00:00:20.078 --> 00:00:24.454
1. So, try factoring and then simplifying this multiplication. What would you

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:26.333
get? Put it here.
