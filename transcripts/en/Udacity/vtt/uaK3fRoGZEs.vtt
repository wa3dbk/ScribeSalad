00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.790
So, in the whole computational photography pipeline,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.650
what we're interested in is finding interesting features within an image.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.850
So far, we've looked at point processes and convolutions.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.450
Now, what we want to actually start doing is building on these concepts,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.760
find interesting features in an image that would be matchable across

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.100
different images.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.550
For that purpose, building on concepts of point processes and

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.400
neighborhood computation on an image, I'm going to introduce the whole

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.730
concept of image gradients, which basically says that at any point in an image,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.400
where is the likelier direction of change?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.410
And using that, we will be extracting things like edges and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.190
other features that we'll talk about next.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.760
But, in this one,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.505
I'm going to actually use the whole concepts of convolution and

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:43.380
cross-correlation to introduce you the concept of how we

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.840
can do processing on an image, to compute image gradients.
