Alright, so the skeleton of this code is pretty much what you've already done before,

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.686
but we're going to introduce a few other things here. First of all, we

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:13.695
set this caller variable to be the caller of xhrGett. Now, this is a special

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:19.682
thing in Javascript and what it does is, whoever ends up calling xhrGet, will be

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:24.861
set as this xhrGet.caller parameter, and you can grab that as necessary. Next,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.155
we do the same thing that we've done this entire time, create a new XMLHttpRequest

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:33.598
and call the open method, then we check the type: if it exists, then we

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.995
set it, otherwise, we assume by default that it is just text. Now the onload

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:42.210
function is where things get interesting if we set a callback then we go ahead

00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:46.330
and try and call it otherwise we don't do anything and this try catch block is

00:00:46.342 --> 00:00:50.689
something that some of you might be familiar with. We try to do what is in this

00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:55.285
try block here and if it fails then we catch the error and throw an exception.

00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:59.358
Now this is basically just going to print out a whole bunch of information about

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.590
the exception. And this is where caller comes in as well. You can see that we

00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:08.371
print out the exception. The response text and the caller just for debugging

00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:13.966
purposes. Finally, we call xhr.send, and that's it. And if we load this up in

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:18.393
our browser, we can see we make both calls. The first one takes a lot less time

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:23.235
than the second one, since it's only JSON. We can see our output JSON in the

00:01:23.247 --> 00:01:27.291
console. And our song starts. [MUSIC]
