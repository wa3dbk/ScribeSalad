00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.807
If f of x is this function of ordered pairs, what would be the inverse of this

00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:09.344
function? When you write your inverse function here, write is as a set with

00:00:09.344 --> 00:00:14.940
curly braces on the ends. And then write your coordinate pairs seperated by

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.189
commas.
