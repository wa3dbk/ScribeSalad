Welcome to lesson six. At this point, you guys can build

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.580
just about anything. You collect data from users. You can build pretty

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.390
web pages. You can store all of this stuff in databases. You

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.465
can manipulate this database. You can build log-ins, all sorts of cool

00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:16.700
things. And when you think about it, just about every website

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.350
on the Internet is some combination of the things you've already learned

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.040
how to do. So it's pretty cool that you can, you've gotten

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.290
this far. Now, one of the things we haven't touched on yet,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.330
is how to build websites that operate at a larger scale.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.260
That is that more than just a couple of people can use.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.450
When you start having websites operating at a big scale, lots

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.490
of things can break down. You can run out of disk space

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.680
for your data. You can run out of bandwidth, to serve

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.140
all of the amazing stuff that you have. Or you can run

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.030
out of you know, processor time to actually generate all of the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.980
amazing computations you're doing. Right? There's

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.750
all sorts of different things that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.960
can, that are limiting factors in how your website functions. And we're

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.020
going to learn how to address each of those things. How to use

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.528
multiple machines if you need to, and that sort of thing. So

00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:03.940
that you can actually build a large-scale website. So, let's jump right in.
