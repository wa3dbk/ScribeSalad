00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's another challenge--this time you are a golfer.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You hit the ball really hard, it goes flying and it lands with some uncertainty that's Gaussian

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
where the distance in expectation is a 100 m and your variance is 30 m².

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And now you do exactly the same thing again--you hit the ball really hard,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it goes flying and has a final position.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Again, you expect it to fly a 100 m with a variance of 40 m².

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Without diving into the mathematics, I'd like you to answer the question first.

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For the combined stroke, what do you expect the distance to be?
