00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right, next we have a bit of a trick question--I'm importing the regular expression library

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and then I'm calling "re.findall" on the regular expression [a-z] [a-z]+,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and the haystack string "a quick brown".

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And that's going to return a list, and in these blanks, I want you to write the elements of that list.

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
One of the strings inside "a quick brown" that are matched by this regular expression.
