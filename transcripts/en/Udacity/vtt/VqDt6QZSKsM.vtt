00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.490
So let's do a Performance Comparison Quiz. Let's say we have, a laptop, that

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.860
takes 4 hours to compress this video. Let's say that we are buying a new

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.220
laptop that can do this, in 10 minutes instead of 4 hours. So the speedup,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.230
of having the new laptop instead of the old one is? Put your answer here.
