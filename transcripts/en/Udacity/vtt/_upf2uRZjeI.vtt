So, now let's come back to this screen. We know that this is an avoidant

00:00:03.186 --> 00:00:07.378
attachment. Given the name, what do you think an anxious ambivalent attachment

00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:11.574
is? Is it this one where the baby cries and becomes very distressed when the

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:16.306
caregiver leaves. But gives the caregiver warm hugs when the caregiver returns,

00:00:16.306 --> 00:00:21.959
and settles down very quickly? Or is it this one? The baby is distressed most

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:25.351
of the time, especially when the caregiver leaves, and goes to the caregiver

00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:30.435
when the varegiver returns, but doesn't give the caregiver warm hugs. It might

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:31.900
even push the caregiver aeway.
