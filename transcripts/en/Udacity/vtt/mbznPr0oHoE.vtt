00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.150
I'm going to take a moment, to get this repository onto my computer.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.400
First I'll make a directory called todo.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.590
I'll cd into it, and I'm going to say git init.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.520
That'll make an empty git repository.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.710
I'm also going to say git, poll and this URL here.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.530
Once that's done,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.610
I should be able to say git log, and sure enough, there are all of the commits.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.260
And are the same commits that are here on GitHub.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.740
I'm going to hop back to my terminal, type Q to get out of that.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.680
And also, if I happen to pull it up in my finder here, you'll find that,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.930
indeed, we do have a to-do application right here.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.290
Now one of the very first things I do when I get a new project,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.020
is I run it in the browser.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.960
Now sometimes this means setting up a local server or installing this or that.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.590
And all those instructions are usually in the read me.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.090
In this application, you can see there is no read me,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.520
and because this case is fairly simple, we can actually just run it directly.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.080
Literally by clicking and dragging index.html, here into the browser.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.280
If you have a local server setup already on your computer,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.480
go ahead and use that.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.060
And if you want to explore local servers and learn how to get them set up,.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.110
Check out the link in the instructor notes.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.470
We're going to move on right now.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.900
In this case, we can see we're looking at a to do application.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.730
This is really convenient, because we need to make a list of things to do.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.450
Here's some good things to do when you first get a code base.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.870
First, I always run the application to see how it works.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.440
Then I like to explore the file structure and

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.650
see what I can infer about the code organization.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.080
It's also important to look at what JavaScript files are being loaded.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.490
Sometimes people will use module loaders, which is just a fancy way of saying,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.400
a library that loads other libraries in the correct order.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.290
In this case, we don't have any complex stuff going on.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.610
Things are staying simple.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.780
So we can just look in the bottom of the index of that HTML file.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.320
To see what JavaScript files are being loaded.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.450
It's also super important to spend some time figuring out what all

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.470
these libraries actually do.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.100
You probably already know what jQuery does, but

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.490
what about the other libraries that are being loaded.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.770
Now these are four of the key things,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.130
that I like to do when I am first exploring a code base.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.880
Now we've already run the application, in fact, I just did.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.699
I'm running it right now.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.390
It's very convenient that it's a to-do application.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.080
Take a few minutes right now, to explore the file structure, look at

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.340
what JavaScript files are loaded, and figure out what those libraries do.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.280
Sometimes that means looking at their code, but most of the time,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.780
it means Googling for them and seeing what their homepage says.
