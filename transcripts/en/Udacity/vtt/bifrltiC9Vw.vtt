The length of the box, since it's folded up, would be 7 minus 2x inches. Since

00:00:05.654 --> 00:00:11.670
the initial length is 7 inches, and then from each corner, we take out x, we're

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.403
taking 7 minus x minus x, which is just equal to 7 minus 2x. So, that means our

00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:19.878
new l for the box is just 7 minus 2x.
