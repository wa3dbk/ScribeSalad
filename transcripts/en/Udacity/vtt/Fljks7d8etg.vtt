00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.930
Okay, so companies do have privacy
policies that address the various

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.340
things that we discussed.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.770
Well, how well do they do
on this privacy policy?

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.230
We haven't actually talked about
scoring the policy, which we did,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.080
but if they have these policies in
place, how well do they follow them?

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.430
Or do they adhere to these policies
that they declare they're following and

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.640
operate according to the policy
that you had agreed to.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.720
Now you want to do business with them,
you want to have a Facebook account,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.360
Facebook said you can only do that
if you agree to the privacy policy.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.450
You gave consent.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.475
Are they going to sort of stay within
the boundaries of that policy, or

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:42.810
they are not?

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.110
And there are times when
companies actually don't do that.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.180
Facebook, in the example that we are
talking about, not only didn't do it,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.600
the U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner FTC
actually had to go after it for

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.560
a while in the people's privacy policy
in the sense that they were doing things

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.400
that the users have
not given consent to.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.430
So what did they do that was bad
which resulted in the FTC action?

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.960
So either they did something
they shouldn't have done, or

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.970
they didn't do something that was
expected by users that they would do.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.530
Well they did a couple of things.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.880
They made information users
had designated as private

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.820
particular with friend's list, they
made it public without user consent.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.970
They also made personal information
available to applications of friends.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.070
So the idea here is, friend then
they can access something but

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.920
this is personal information that
you had not agreed per the policy.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.460
The policy you had agree to that was
made available to these applications.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.060
They shared information with advertisers

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.300
that it had promised
not to share with them.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.540
The members who collect use and

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.650
the next thing was share and
I should know who they're sharing with.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.750
In this case,
they shared it with people.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.540
When they'd promised or told me
that they were not going to share.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.930
And they said certain apps were verified
which were really not verified so

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.360
that was misleading of course.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.270
So these are the kind of things that
they did which caught the attention of

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.610
the Federal Trade Commission and
The FTC then went after them saying,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.120
you are violating your user's privacy.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.610
So Facebook then

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.000
did things that were inconsistent with
the privacy policy they had advertise.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.930
So we said the FTC took action and

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.490
some of the sanctions example to that,
the consequences of this violation for

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.910
Facebook are the number of those
that the FTC actually mandated.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.820
One is that they had to have a privacy
audit, and that had to be done

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.280
periodically, biannually, and this is
going to be done for the next 20 years.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.710
So someone from outside has to come and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.960
do a privacy audit, you're not
going to take their word for it.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.130
Their Facebook is prohibited from,
told not to do it,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.460
misrepresenting privacy and security
settings that are provided to consumers.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.890
Okay?
If you say something is not public,

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.250
it should not be public.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.040
You shouldn't make it public without
the user being informed about it and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.575
agreeing to it, and they also
required Facebook to get consent

00:03:16.575 --> 00:03:22.140
before sharing any information in a way
that exceeds their privacy settings.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.850
Okay?
So, the consent thing is

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.770
big when it comes to privacy.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.320
If you give consent then they can
do whatever you consented to.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.300
But the idea here is that consent,
affirmative express consent

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.320
because some default should not be that
we can share without checking with them.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.590
It should be that they should agree to
it expressly, or you can share it if

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.930
this is in a way that is not
revealed by their privacy settings.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.330
So these are some examples of
the sanctions that the FTC,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.660
when they dealt with the Facebook
case they had, they came up with.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.780
And that's what was slapped on Facebook.
