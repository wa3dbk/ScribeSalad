00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.090
So how might we think about creating
some channels that make it easier to

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.540
separate these things?

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.150
Well we already saw this from
our previous conversation.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.650
Let's separate out the intensity
from the color, okay?

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.620
So the first thing we're going to do,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.850
it we're going to define intensity Y as
some combination of R, G, and B, okay?

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.167
And so
that gives you this nice picture here.

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:27.886
And those of you that are old enough
to remember black and white television,

00:00:27.886 --> 00:00:30.151
you start to be thinking,
oh, wait a minute,

00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:34.125
this is like an image that just reflects
the overall intensity of what's there.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:37.200
And that would be correct, all right?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.320
And in fact, a luminance function,
which is what this called,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.670
is just a linear weight of the red,
green and blue pixels.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.590
Here are weights of red, green and blue.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.160
And by combining them together,
I get a single value Y, for luminance.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.490
Remember, Y stands for luminance for

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.890
reasons that are,
because it's the middle of X, Y, Z.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.960
That's why.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.490
All right, so
now I need the two other values, right?

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.519
I mean I could just keep the R,
G and then try to reconstruct them.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.590
But instead what they do is they
compute a different color space.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.450
Then this is called the YUV colorspace.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.170
And here's a,
a computation that takes the B values,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.600
the Y values, and
creates a new value called U and V.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.170
And a way of thinking about this is
one of them has to do with sort of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.400
the difference between
the luminance in blue.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.350
And the other one is the difference
between luminance in red and

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.310
it matches and
it creates this thing called UV.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.530
And the thing that you need,
that you need to know is that U and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.750
V contain the color information.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.393
So they tell you that they're
giving you an image in YUV space,

00:01:40.393 --> 00:01:44.958
you know that UV contain the,
the chromatic the color information.

00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.769
And by the way in this YUV mapping,
there's a maximum and

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:51.167
minimum that U and V can get maxed to.

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:54.270
And that's why it's called Umax and
Vmax.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.280
And we assume the R,
G, B range from 0 to 1.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.520
Okay, if it goes from zero to 255
you just scale the whole thing.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.270
All right, when you create that you
can actually make three images, right?

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.310
You can make a Y image,
a U image and a V image and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.840
that would look like this, all right?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.350
So the Y image is ju, exactly what
you're used to seeing in your black and

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.580
white television.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.390
But your U image and your V image,
those contain the color elements.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.490
Now you might ask,
well why aren't they in color?

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.840
&gt;&gt; Why aren't they in color?

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.792
&gt;&gt; Because each one of them
is a single channel, okay?

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:27.792
Right, so that's the U.

00:02:27.792 --> 00:02:31.920
So the brighter it is, the higher U,
the lower it is, the, the less U.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.770
Same thing with V.
