00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.538
Well, we square, or multiply the two side lengths together to get the area. So

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:10.730
this first side length would be 2, since 2 times 2 equals 4. The second square

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.808
would have a side length of 5, since 5 times 5 equals 25. And the last square

00:00:15.808 --> 00:00:19.897
would have a side length of 9, since 9 times 9 equals 81.
