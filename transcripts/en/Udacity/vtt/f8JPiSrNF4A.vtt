[MUSIC]

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.115
Welcome back.

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:21.525
We've been looking at how frameworks
help developers become more productive.

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:24.485
And we've taken a deep dive into
specific features of backbone and

00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:25.235
underscore.

00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:28.055
In this lesson, you'll be using
the Angular framework to put together

00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:32.034
a simple app that let's you record menu
items for a specific meal of the day.

00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:34.785
We'll be diving into Angular
version one, which is a mature and

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:36.230
stable framework.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.170
Angular two is currently
under development and

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.890
is not backwards compatible
with Angular one.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.960
Just as a local model is built up of
a number of different pieces to form

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.520
a complete design.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.000
Frameworks are built up of
different techniques and concepts.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.060
Learning the concepts and this lesson
will make it easy to snap on concepts

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.670
from Angular two or another framework.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.820
As we go through this lesson.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.660
I encourage you to work through
each of the steps yourself.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.380
Build up the app along with me.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.410
You'll learn a lot by watching me
work through building up a project.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.090
But you'll learn so
much more if you build it yourself.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820
Angular is an awesome framework.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.360
And when we're finished, I hope you'll
love working with it as much as I do.
