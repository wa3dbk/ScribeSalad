00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.320
Let's do an example. I got this idea from Dan Meyer, a really great math

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.370
teacher. The link to his blog is below, with more ideas around the upcoming

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.170
example. Let's say you want to go on vacation, but you have a budget of $500.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.560
Where are some places you could go? How much will it cost to go to Reykjavic,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.578
where they have awesome volcanic beaches? Or maybe Dublin, Ireland? Or Kumasi,

00:00:23.578 --> 00:00:28.820
Ghana. You'll go anywhere. You just want to have an adventure. You decide to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.600
analyze some flights and plotted the number of miles they traveled and the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.720
costs of that plane ticket. Here's a scatter plot showing the nine flights you

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.590
looked up. Here's the line of best fit. This shows the expected value of the

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.220
dependent variable, y, for any value of the independent variable. Let's focus

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.290
on this point, for example. For this x value, which looks like it's about 1,500

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.130
miles, we see that the flight costs almost $800. Let's say this is about 750

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.760
dollars. This is the observed value. But based on our line of best fit, we

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.960
would expect that a flight that travels 1500 miles would cost more like 450

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.770
dollars. These expected values for any x value are symbolized by y hatt.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.350
Whereas the observed values are just are regular y values. You can see that we

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.730
have an observed and expected value for all of these data values. Take this

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.925
one, for example. We travel about 5,010 miles, let's say. And the actual or

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:42.920
observed price was about $1500. But according to our line of best fit, we would

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.790
have expected this to cost about $1200. The prices for both these flights were

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.710
more than we would have expected based on all of our data. The difference

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.240
between our observed and expected value is called the residual. There's a

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.110
residual for every point in the data set. It might be 0, or it might be huge.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.370
The most important thing is that we're able to find this line of best fit and

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:14.090
then use it to visualize the data and the relationship between x and y, and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.120
make predictions.
