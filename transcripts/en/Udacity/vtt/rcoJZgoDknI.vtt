00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.615
The last conic section we'll learn about is a parabola. Parabolas only have one

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:10.930
part to their graph. Circles on the other hand have two parts to their graph.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.774
And the reason they have two parts is because we have an x squared term and we

00:00:14.774 --> 00:00:21.119
have a y squared term. Ellipses also have two parts to their graph. And again,

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.222
notice that the equation for the ellipse has an x squared term and it also has

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:33.650
a y squared term. And finally, we saw the hyperbola. The hyperbola also has two

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.334
parts to its graph. And notice, in the equation, we have the x squared term and

00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:46.572
we have the y squared term. But a parabola only has one piece. The parabola can

00:00:46.572 --> 00:00:52.511
either open up or down, or the parabola can open left or right. Each of these

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:58.403
is one graph. Of one parabola. These two equations are the general equations

00:00:58.403 --> 00:01:03.525
that describe parabolas. This one describes parabolas that open up or down, and

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:08.639
notice that it's y equals. This equation describes parabolas that open to the

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:13.450
left and that open to the right. And notice that it starts with x equals.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.714
Throughout this lesson, we'll learn more about each of these values and what

00:01:16.714 --> 00:01:21.104
they do to the graph. But for now, let's take a look at the most basic

00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:23.780
parabola. y equals x squared.
