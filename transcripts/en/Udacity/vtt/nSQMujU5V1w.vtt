00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We''ll I hope you enjoyed trying to fool the test coverage metrics.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We'll it turns out there's essentially an infinite number of ways to do that.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The way I chose was to insert a call to the absolute value function,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so here we're iterating over the values and the list of numbers looking for the largest one,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the smallest one, and competing frequency leading to the mode.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What I did here is so that i is equal to the absolute value of i.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now of course when the inputs are positive as they are in the first two test cases

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that achieved 100% statement coverage, everything is fine.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
On the other hand in the other test cases, what I do is call them with the list containing

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
negative values and of course, it's going to compute the wrong thing for them--right.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So the list contains -33 and -34, and clearly the minimum value

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
in that list is not 33 and the max is not 34.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So what you can see here is I've met the requirements of the assignment.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
As I said, really there are a lot of different ways you could've accomplished this effect

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and realistically, for purposes of this assignment which was to get you to think about 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the limitations of coverage a little bit, any of them would be just as good as the other.
