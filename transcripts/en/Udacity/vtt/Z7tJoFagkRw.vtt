00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.000
Now I do want us to look at the film a little bit more carefully.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.060
Basically a film is the whole process of how

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.180
a chemical process is used to convert light.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.850
And the, basically it is the energy of the light itself that changes

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.080
the chemicals.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.310
And then of course we have to frill, figure out how to preserve that changed in

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.040
chemical process to then basically be able to store light into film.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.320
Here I have just laid out a, a simple 35 millimeter film, pretty much like

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.770
the same one that I'm showing here and I basically kind of now unwrapped it.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.390
In the schematic to show different parts of a film.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.200
So in this instance, light is coming in.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.720
And if you notice any one in this one,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.220
the light was coming in from that side, and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.740
that was the one that was pointing to the optics, the the lens of the camera.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.210
The light comes in and, of course, there are many different layers.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.940
Let's just go quickly over them and see what what each one of them does.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.350
First layer is the protective layer.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.530
We need to be able to protect all of these light sensitive layers that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.130
are actually going to exist.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.130
Of course, in most types of cameras and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.570
films like this we also put in a UV filter.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.820
The UV filter is there to just make sure that the right kinds of light, and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.010
not damaging lights, are hitting the different types of sensors.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.650
Ignore the colors of these types of things.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.990
Each one of them has a different feature.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.080
So the first one that the light hits is a blue light layer,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.740
then a yellow filter is added to kind of get the yellow light out,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.980
green light layer, red light layer.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.570
So, again, we have green, red, and blue lights, then there is

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.370
an adhesive which is put in there, so these are all very thin layers.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.020
And, of course, thickest one is the film base, which gives it the structure and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.280
keeps it stable.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.050
So in essence, all of this is tied up in something this thin.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.050
So it's important to note that not only in the, in the present days,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.950
people can pack things up in small things,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.979
a lot of this packed up into a very small thing there.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.070
So in essence, a film is a sheet of plastic.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.410
And that's what I've shown you so far.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.490
It's coated with an emulsion that is basically full of light sensitive,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.270
silver halite salts, which have been bonded by a gelatin.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.549
So in essence there are silver halite salts inside the layers.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.160
These are the light sensitive ones that actually store the light changes.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.620
And then there are variable crystals all over the film also, that basically

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.500
determine the sensitivity, the contrast, and the resolution of the film.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.190
This is where some issues like ISO come in, because this is where all of

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.110
that practicability of how sensitive that film is comes in.
