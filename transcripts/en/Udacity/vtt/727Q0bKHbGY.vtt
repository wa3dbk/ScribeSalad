00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.680
So, let us do another exercise together. This time I have picked a different

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.520
choice, choice 2 here. So now, we can build a representation for

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.840
A is to B like earlier, and here is a representation of C is to 2.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.200
I would like you to fill out these boxes for the labels on the links here.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.410
And then answer whether or not two is the right answer for this problem.
