00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
So which of these problems here are computer problems? So, let's just check the three rules.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.490
Given an essay by a student, that is definitely a finite string using a constant number of symbols.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.900
So rule 1 here is okay. Does that essay have at least 10,000 characters?

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.680
Where the output is same, either yes or no?

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.220
So that is easily fulfill-able and of course the answer here is also objectively correct.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.900
You can easily count the number of characters and say, yes it's at least 10,000 or no, it's not.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.940
So this is definitely a computer problem.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.500
The second, one of course, well, the output would still be a finite string,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.250
because you could say depending on the grading system, A, B, C, D, or 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.240
of course, the output is not objectively correct because different instructors

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.550
tend to sometimes at least disagree on the grade that an essay deserves.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.900
So this is not a computer problem although there have been attempts for

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.620
automated grading which is just weird to say at least.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.050
Does the essay contain any misspelled words? Now this is a tricky one.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.600
So the input again is finite. The output basically just says yes or no or it can even specify the word.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.110
The problem is that it's sometimes very hard to say if something is a spelling mistake.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.560
I'll give you one example. Consider for example this sentence here.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.180
He was attacked by a rat.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.170
At first sight, this sentence--at least if I'd written it in the correct way--

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.790
does not contain any misspelled words, but actually it could contain a misspelled word,

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.340
because what if the author actually had meant to type he was attacked by a bat.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.410
That sentence by itself might make perfect sense but you could still have

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.690
simply mistyped this word here although of course your computer has a spell checker,

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.930
you might've noticed that the spell checker sometimes is wrong

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.150
because it sometimes just cannot figure out in which context your saying your sentence.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.860
And even if it were a very very strong computer and this example here,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.870
you cannot objectively determine if this is the right answer.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.660
It can be dependent more or less totally on the author.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.190
This problem here is actually not a computer problem in the way that it's stated here.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.200
But this was a bit of a tricky one, so I hope you're not frustrated if you didn't get that.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.390
But it tells you that sometimes you have to watch out very careful with these rules.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.400
They sound very simple but actually there are some tricky details seen in here.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.600
So let's go to the next set of problems. Given two integers, what is their sum?

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.430
That, of course, is a very classic computer problem.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.350
The integers are given as numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The output is a number that's also fine. It's finite.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.390
And adding something where you can definitely have a definitive and objective answer.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.760
Does the smaller integer divide the larger one? Yes absolutely a computer problem.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.050
The answer is yes or no and you can objectively say if the answer is correct or no.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.610
This one down here is not a computer problem and actually

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.530
it's not a computer problem for two reasons.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.360
One reason which is a bit technical is the RAM computer

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.570
or a normal computer doesn't really have true randomness.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.000
A normal computer generates numbers that seem like random

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
using an algorithm but that is not random, but as I said this is a bit technical.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.220
I think the main reason why this is not a computer problem is that it's not possible

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.360
once you have the answer to actually know if this answer is correct.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.290
So if the number was indeed generated at random. So let me give you one example.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.580
So for example, I have the numbers 7 and 10, and now I say that

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.770
I have randomly generated a 9 which lies between the two.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.790
You have no way of checking this I really generated this number using coin flips,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.680
or throwing a dice, or if I just made that up, or maybe if I use an algorithm that always outputs a 9.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.060
So there's no way to determine from an output if that output

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.230
has really been generated using a random process.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.440
And that is basically also the same reason why this one here is not correct.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.080
Of course you can kind of determine the likelihood if this is a very long string of 0s and 1s,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.140
you can say well this looks more or less like a random string or not random string,

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.290
but actually if the string is generated choosing uniformly between 0s and 1s,

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.860
any string is as likely as any other string, so it's not possible to objectively check the answer yes.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.820
So for example, if I say I generated a string using a number of coin flips

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.170
and I have heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.410
it might not look random but maybe I was just lucky at that moment.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.839
Now the final answer here and if you got that right without checking this answer video,

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.550
then you're almost a master of theoretical computer science

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.540
because this again is a quite tricky one in my mind.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.520
I will tell you that this is not a computer problem. Why is that not a computer problem?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.900
You can enter a √5 into your computer, which you need to do like this, into Google for example,

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.890
and then we'll tell you that the √5 is 2.23606798 but that is actually not the correct answer.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.580
For example, if I enter it into another calculator or webpage that has more digits,

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.750
then that will tell me that it's actually not 6798, but actually

00:04:51.750 --> 00:05:02.480
2.23606606797749978969640917366973 and so on.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:10.710
The √5 is an infinite string. If I ask a computer to calculate √5 to within a certain position,

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.110
say, I want the first 10 digits or so, then it is a computer problem

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.040
but just asking a computer to calculate the √5, then this way is not correct.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.190
Why am I nitpicking you here like this?

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.340
Well the thing is this, infinities will play a very important role here in this unit

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.930
when it comes to problem set no computer can ever solve.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.420
This is why it's very important to make sure that the input is finite and the output is finite.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.890
So if you do not phrase the question here very precisely,

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.430
then some of the results will change or not be correct.

00:05:38.430 --> 99:59:59.000
So, it's very important to ensure finiteness and later in this unit you will see why it's so important.
