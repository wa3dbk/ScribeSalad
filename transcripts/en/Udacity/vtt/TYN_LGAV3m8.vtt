When you adjust the bin width, and here the bin

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.460
width is set to one, you really see these dramatic

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.530
patterns, these tall vertical lines. This is because when you

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.570
say, how many people do you think saw this post, people

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.890
typically say, oh, 10, 20, 50, 100. People guess these

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.510
regular numbers, and they don't tend to guess Numbers in

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.170
between. So this really helped me get a feel for

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.860
how big people thought their audience size was. The most common

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.880
guess was I think 20 with 50 and 100 close behind. In most

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.850
cases though, this was only about a quarter the size of the actual audience.
