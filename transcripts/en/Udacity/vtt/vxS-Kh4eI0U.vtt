00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.880
In this case, the outlier was an example of bad data

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.320
about an extreme case. The respondent in Moira's study said that

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.970
they had over 1 million friends. Moira's outlier had a value

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.590
of 10 million, which isn't possible using Facebook. So that would

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.510
be an example of bad data in an extreme case since

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.560
we're at the higher end of people who saw the post.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.200
In general, I think it's really important that we think about

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.500
What type of case or categories that our outliers fall into.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.740
This may help us think about how we can adjust for the outliers, or

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.630
replace them or exclude them for our data, if we want to make those decisions.
