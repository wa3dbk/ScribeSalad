00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.410
Let's now start talking about UML, the Unified Modeling Language.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.530
And we are going to start by looking at UML

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.390
structural diagrams. This are the diagrams that represent static characteristics

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.430
of the system that we need to model. This is

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.170
in contrast with dynamic models which instead behaviors of the

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.200
system that we need to model. And we will also

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.424
discuss dynamic models, later on in the lesson. We're going

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:25.670
to discuss several kinds of diagrams, starting from the class

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.228
diagram, which is a fundamental one in UML.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.390
The class diagram represents a static, structural view of

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.190
the system, and it describes the classes and their

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.630
structure, and the relationships among classes in the system.
