00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.726
Again, if 0.1% is out here, then this must mean that this yellow or orange

00:00:06.726 --> 00:00:14.114
region is 99.9%. So that means we're going to look for 0.999 in our z table.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:23.630
Here's 0.999 and that's at 3.10. You'll notice that there are a few 0.999's. We

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.830
want the first one, because that's the one that's closed to 0.999. And then the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.332
others will just get bigger. So this one's 0.99905, I don't know, something

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:39.550
like that, we can't really tell. But we know that this first one is going to be

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:48.124
closest to just plain old 0.999. And so that is at 3.08.
