Historical financial data
is of course essential for

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.510
effective financial research.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.780
One reason people are attracted to
finance as an area of research,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.530
is because they believe the data
is very well documented.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.360
In other words, all the data is
monitored and recorded by computer and

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.050
saved for us to pore over later.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.460
It turns out though that there
are many ways the data can be faulty.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.960
In this lesson, we're going to look
at how missing data can occur and

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.840
what we can do about it.
