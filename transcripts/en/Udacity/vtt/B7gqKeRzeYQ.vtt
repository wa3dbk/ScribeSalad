00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
There are lots of ways you may find this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
One is to look at the output from dir and see all the methods available for sets

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and one thing you might notice looking at this is that

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
there are methods like difference followed by difference_update

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Similarly for intersection, intersection_update.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Similarly for symmetric difference, symmetric difference_update

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and then we get to union, there is no union_update, but the method following union is called update.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So that sounds like a good one to try.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It is certainly not enough to know that it does what we want, but let's try it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So we make a new set t and then let's try updating s with t.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, we could've actually look at this documentation.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It says update the set with union of itself and others

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that might give us a good guess that it's going to do what we want already,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but let's actually try it and now let's see what's in s.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Well, we started with a set 1, 2, 3.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We union it with this set that should add elements for 4, 6, and 7 to the set.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's check the t was not modified and indeed, it was not.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Although, you might notice that the order of the elements is different

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
from what they were when we created t from this list,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but remember that what a set is an unordered collection of elements.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So the order that it prints out here does not mean anything.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's the same set as the one listed in this order.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We could try that confirming that with an equality test and indeed, these two sets are equal.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So this experiment gives us some confidence that update, that's what we want.
