&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So this new equation was super fun to solve. It was great. We knew exactly

00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:09.576
what we were doing. But what if we change one little tiny thing? What if I make

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:14.527
this a negative 5, instead of a positive 5. The question I have for you is, is

00:00:14.527 --> 00:00:19.584
this an equation that we can solve? In other words, is this an equation at all?

00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:20.792
Tell me, yes or no.
