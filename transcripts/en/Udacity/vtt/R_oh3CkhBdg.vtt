00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Now how do we use this?

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Well, we take a function we define, say seq of x, y,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and then we can say sequence is redefined as being an n_ary function of sequence.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Oops--I guess I got to fix this typo here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
From now on, I can call sequence and pass in any number of numbers,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and it will return the result that looks like that.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So that looks good.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In fact, this pattern is so common in Python that there's a special notation for it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The notation is called the decorator notation.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It looks like this.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
All we have to do is say, @ sign, then the name of a function, and then the definition.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This is the same as saying sequence = n_ary of sequence.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's just an easier way to write it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But there is one problem with the way we specified this particular decorator,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
which is if I'm in an interactive session, and I ask for help on sequence,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I would like to see the argument list and if there is a doc string,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I want to see the documentation here.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I didn't happen to put in any documentation for sequence.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But when I ask for help, what I get is this.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm told that sequence is called n_ary function. Well, why is that?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Because this is what we returned when we define sequence = n_ary of sequence.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We return this thing that has the name n_ary function.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So we would like to fix n_ary up so that when the object that it returns

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
has the same function name and the same function documentation--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
if there is any documentation--and have that copied over into the n_ary f function.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Now it turns out that there is a function to do exacty that,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and so I'm going to go get it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm going to say from the functools--the functional tools package.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I want to import the function called update_wrapper.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Update_wrapper takes 2 functions, and it copies over the function name

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and the documentation and several other stuff

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
from the old function to the new function,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and I can change n_ary to do that, so once I've defined the n_ary function,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
then I can go ahead and update the wrapper of the n_ary function--

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
the thing I'm going to be returning from the old function.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So this will be the old sequence, which has a sequence name, a list of arguments,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
maybe some documentation string, and this will be the function that we were returning,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and we're copying over everything from f into n_ary f.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Now when I ask for help--when I define n_ary sequence, and I ask for help on sequence,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
what I'll see is the correct name for sequence,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and if there was any documentation string for sequence, that would appear here as well.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So update_wrappers is a helpful tool. It helps us when we're debugging.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It doesn't really help us in the execution of the program, but in doing debugging,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
it's really helpful to know what the correct names of your functions are.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Notice that we may be violating the Don't Repeat Yourself principle here.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So this n_ary function is a decorator that I'm using in this form to update

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the definition of sequence.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I had to--within my definition of n_ary--I had to write down that I want to update the wrapper.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
But it seems like I'm going to want to update the wrapper for every decorator,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
not just for n_ary, and I don't want to repeat myself on every decorator

00:03:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that I'm going to define.
