00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Another category of graphs that are very important and come up a lot are planar graphs.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
These are graphs that can be drawn in the plane on a flat piece of paper

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so that the edges don't cross.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here's an example of a planar graph.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We've got five nodes and five edges.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You see the way I drew it here. This node here and this node needed to be connected.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I just drew a nice, little curvy line without crossing anything else.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is a planar graph. It still would be a planar graph even if I drew it with a crossing in it,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because the issue is that there is some way to do it so that the edges don't cross.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now, in this particular example, we've got five nodes and five edges,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but what we're interested in is what is the relationship in general between the number

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
of nodes in a planar graph and the number of edges.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is more complicated example than any of the ones we looked at before in this unit.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There is some kind of a relationship, and there are constraints

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
by virtue of the fact that the graph is drawn in the plane.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Let's take a look at that. Let's think about adding some edges here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We can add that edge. We can add this edge. We can add this edge.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We can add this edge, and are there any more edges we can add

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
while still being able to draw it in a plane? It doesn't look that way, right?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This node is connected to all the other nodes. This one is done.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This node is connected to three other nodes, but it can't reach this one.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It seems like it's sort of all blocked out. That's going to be true in general.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
There's going to be some graphs that can't be drawn as a planar graph.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If we add this edge between this node and this node, the resulting graph is no longer planar.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
How many edges do we get here all told?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In this example, the number of edges seems to need to be less than or equal to 9.
