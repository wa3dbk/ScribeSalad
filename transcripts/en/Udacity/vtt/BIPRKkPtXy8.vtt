Responding with web pages is great, but

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.490
sometimes all that needs to be
communicated is information.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.020
For example, let's say that there's
a web application out there called Yum

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.330
that wants to collect
our restaurant menus and

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.940
advertise them to mobile clients
based on their location.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.860
Free advertising, all right!

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.290
This app wants to see the restaurants
and menus available in our database but

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.460
doesn't really need to
parse through HTML or

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.770
waste bandwidth receiving CSS files.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.710
It just wants the data.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.550
For this reason,
developers have created APIs, or

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.610
Application Programming Interfaces,
that allow external applications to use

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.680
public information our
apps want to share,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.210
without all the bells and whistles.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.984
When an API is communicated over the
Internet, following the rules of HTTP,

00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:41.330
we call this a restful API.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.230
One of the most popular ways of sending
data with a restful architecture is with

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.070
a format called JSON, which stands for
JavaScript object notation.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.730
JSON uses attribute value pairings
which are delimited by a colon.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.500
Brackets are used to
encapsulate individual objects.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.830
Let's start coding to add this
JSON feature to our application.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.570
Before we write the JSON
function in our Flask menu app,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.490
let's first open up the database
setup.pi and add a decorator method.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.470
This serializable function will help
define what data we want to send across,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.020
and put it in a format
that Flask can easily use.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.130
Flask has a built-in package,
called jsonify,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.370
that will allow us to easily configure
an API endpoint for our application.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.752
I will go ahead and import this
package now in my project.py file.

00:01:22.752 --> 00:01:26.240
For this lesson we are only going to
focus on using a get request to get

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.960
a collection of restaurant menu items.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560
But know that other types of
requests can be implemented as well.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.920
I will now create a route similar
to my restaurant menu page

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.000
with /JSON at the end.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.190
I then create a function and
name it restaurant menu JSON and

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.260
then perform the same query as
in my restaurant menu class.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.760
But instead of returning a template,
I will return this jsonify class and

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.740
use this loop to serialize
all of my database entries.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.140
Now, if I save and go to local host
port 5000/restaurants/1/menu/json,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.110
I return with the pure data form
of my menu in a format that can

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.080
easily be read by humans and
easily parsed by other computers
