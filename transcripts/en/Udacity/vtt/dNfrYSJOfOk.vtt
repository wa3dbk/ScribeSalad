00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.540
We mentioned previously CAMPS.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.610
The first letter letter stands for
Culture.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.939
What does that mean?

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.350
Huge inspiration for DevOps, is Agile.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.600
And one of Agile's key points is,
people over process over tools.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.280
You can have the most efficient product,
development, operations, and marketing

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.960
teams in the world, but if they do not
communicate, there's no feedback or

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.600
collaboration between teams, it can lead
to a huge waste of time and resources.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.650
Lean is also a major inspiration for
DevOps culture.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.940
Lean is centered on streamlining
operations, reducing waste,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.080
with the end goal of
maximizing customer value.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.320
Improving separate points in
the production pipeline is not enough,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.340
you have to improve the whole flow.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.500
Ever hear the phrase hurry up and wait?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.920
Reminds me of traveling
on international flights.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.780
Having a faster silo doesn't really
help in getting me to the plane quicker.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.750
I usually just end up
waiting in the next line.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.480
This is also true for DevOps.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.870
If we focus on our
customers as the main goal,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.045
it becomes an easy common ground for
all concerned parties.

00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:59.245
A great culture is also important,
fostering respect.

00:00:59.245 --> 00:01:00.755
You can also call it hug ops.

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:04.885
When you can understand and you can
empathize on both Dev and Ops teams,

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:08.185
you can really focus your
energies on positive outcomes.

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:11.495
Usually known as going to work thinking
how can I make this harder, but

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:13.755
there are various reasons
as to why it happens.
