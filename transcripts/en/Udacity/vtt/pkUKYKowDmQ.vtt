00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:04.334
let's practise applying patterns. Remember the HomeworkScores class from before,

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:08.898
here's a slightly modified version of it. We had it collect all of the scores,

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:13.637
so that we could do competitions with them later. But if all that we want is to

00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:17.236
add all of the scores in and calculate the total without the lowest one, we

00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:22.747
don't need to collect of the scores. So, here's the outline of what we want to

00:00:22.747 --> 00:00:28.680
build. A HomeworkScores class with an addScore method and a getTotal excluding

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.800
lowest method. The only method that should be a mutator is the addScore method.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.301
In earlier lessons, we had a method for removing the minimum score. But in this

00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:41.838
version we wont remove any. We will just find a way to no to count them when we

00:00:41.838 --> 00:00:45.851
are calculating the total. There are few corner cases I'd like you to think

00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:49.698
about, they have special behavior. If there are no scores yet, say that the

00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:54.088
total is 0. If there is one score, say the total is that score. If there are

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:58.037
more, say the total is the total excluding the lowest. Now remember, I'd like

00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:01.157
you to do this without collecting all of the scores in an array list, or an

00:01:01.157 --> 00:01:06.120
array. Try this yourself. And if you'd like a hint, there will be hint links

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.560
over here. They'll show you more videos.
