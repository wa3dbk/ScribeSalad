00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We need a faster test for primes.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What we're going to use is a probabilistic test.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That means if some number x passes the test,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the probability that x's composite is less than some value.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We're going to use probabilities like 2^(-128).

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is certainly low enough for most uses in crytography.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
One way to think about that is if the key size is 128 bits,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we already have that probability that someone would randomly guess that key correctly.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The main basis of probabilistic primality tests is properties of prime numbers.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
One useful theorem about prime numbers is Fermat's Little Theorem,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
which states that if p is prime, if we select some number a between 1 and p

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and raise a^(p-1) power--modulo p--the result must always be 1.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Maybe we could try lots of a's.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If this equation always holds that a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 mod p,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that would mean that p is probably prime.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The problem is that there are some composite numbers

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that are known as Carmichael numbers where this test also holds for most a values.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Indeed, it holds for all the a values that are relatively prime with p.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Unless we try all the a numbers between 1 and p

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
there is a high probability that this will always hold.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If we need to try them all, this test isn't fast enough.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It's still going to be exponential in the size of p.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The good news is there is a faster test, which is known as the Rabin-Miller test.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Sometimes it's known as the Miller-Rabin test.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It was discovered independently by both Miller and Rabin.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The main idea was originally proposed by Gary Miller in 1976.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He provided the deterministic test based on the assumption that Riemann hypothesis was true.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Michael Rabin, who won the Turing award in 1976,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
probably did some of his more important work after winning the Turing award, which is quite unusual,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
proposed this in 1980, and that's the one that we'll talk about.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Here is how this works, and I'm not going to cover the mathematics behind it,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
but just enough to be able to implement the test.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We're going to start with our guess n, which must be odd.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Obviously, if it's even it's not prime.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Because it's odd, that means we can write it as a multiple of 2 + 1.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
That means we can break it into 2^t  s + 1.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Next we want to choose some random a value in this range from 1 to n -1.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
If n is prime, we know that either a^s is equal to 1 mod n

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
or we know that a^(s(2^j)) is equal to n - 1 mod n for some j.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The j values are in the range from 0 to t -1, which is the power here.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
That's the big advantage that we only need to try a small number of values.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
If we don't find any value that satisfies this, we know it's composite.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The important property that this test has that's different from the Fermat test

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
is that the probability that a composite number of passes

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
is always less than some constant.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
In this case it is less than one quarter.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
There are no bad composite numbers like the Carmichael numbers.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
If we choose a randomly, for any composite number the probability that the test

00:03:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
is less than one-quarter.
