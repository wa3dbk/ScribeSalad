00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.150
One reason that we use four by four matrices to store transforms is that a

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.590
single matrix can hold any number of transforms at once. As an example, consider

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.572
object three D's rotation paratmeter. Here is a snipet of code from the oil

00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:17.830
angler demo. The airplane's three rotation axis are already set. This means that

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.520
the airplane is first rotated around its z axis then its y axis, then x.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.556
Internally a transform matrix is made for each rotation. Then these are

00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:31.629
multiplied together. Matrix multiplication works like this. For each location in

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:35.212
the resulting matrix, you take the corresponding row of the first matrix.

00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:38.821
[inaudible] And the column of the second matrix, and perform a dot product

00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:43.330
between these two. For example, to compute element n two four, I compute the dot

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.600
product of the fourth row of the first matrix, and the second column of the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.890
second matrix. This gives this set of terms here, added together gives n two

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.020
four, 16 dot products later and you have the resulting matrix. To multiply

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.924
together our three rotation matrices. We can start at either end. Multiplying Rx

00:01:01.924 --> 00:01:06.730
by Ry or Ry by Rz. I've decided to start with Ry and Rz. Multiplying these

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.676
together we get some temporary matrix U. We can then multiply together the X

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:15.775
rotation matrix by this temporary matrix. This gives us another matrix call it Q

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:19.858
which consists of all three rotation matrices multiplied together. This

00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:23.764
resulting matrix Q can then be used to transform coordinates when an object

00:01:23.764 --> 00:01:27.608
coordinate is transformed by this single matrix the coordinate in fact is

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:31.638
rotated by the three rotation matrices in turn it's clearly more efficient to

00:01:31.638 --> 00:01:36.238
use a single matrix than three. The scale and translation parameters in the

00:01:36.238 --> 00:01:40.240
object 3-d class do the same thing. They create matrices and these all get

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.592
multiplied together. Here's the full sequence of transforms that happen for an

00:01:44.592 --> 00:01:48.835
object 3-d when using its parameters: scale, the 3 rotations, and translate.

00:01:48.836 --> 00:01:52.563
Internally, these matrices are all multiplied together to give a single

00:01:52.563 --> 00:01:57.430
resulting matrix m. The parameter in the object 3D class, is, in fact, called

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.550
matrix. You can now see why I've been listing the order of matrices as from

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.956
right to left. As this is the order we use for multiplying them together.

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:09.363
Multiplying matrices together like this is called concatenation.
