00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.188
What we're looking for here is just the other x intercept of our new graph.

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:08.968
That's this point right here and its coordinates are 2, 0. So the water will

00:00:08.968 --> 00:00:13.275
land 2 meters from the base of the fountain. Alternatively, we could have of

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:17.537
course figured this out from the equation alone. We can set up a quadratic

00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:22.273
equation, 0 equals negative 7x squared plus 14 x, then I could just factor the

00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:27.035
right side, which gives us 0 equals negative 7x times the quantity x minus 2.

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:31.348
This equation will be satisfied if either negative 7x equals 0 or if the

00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:35.845
quantity x minus 2 equals 0. Of course, you get x equals 0 for the first

00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:40.805
solution, which is the one we already knew ahead of time. And then, we get x

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:45.082
equals 2 for the second one, which is the one we just figured out.
