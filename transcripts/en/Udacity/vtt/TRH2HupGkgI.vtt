00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.980
Let's talk now, more specifically, about processes.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.590
And, we'll start first by understanding, what is a process?

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.370
To do this, recall that one of the roles of

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.680
the operating system is to manage the hardware on behalf of applications.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.390
An application is a program that's on disk, in flash memory, even in the cloud.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.620
But it's not executing, it's a static entity.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.370
Here, for instance,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.530
in this picture, we have some application that's stored on disk.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.300
Once an application is launched, it's loaded in memory here, and

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.300
it starts executing.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.300
Then it becomes a process.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.420
So a process is an active entity.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.740
If the same program is launched more than once,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.140
then multiple processes will be created.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.760
These processes will executing the same program, but

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.240
potentially will have very different state.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.640
In fact, very likely they will have very different state.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.450
For instance, a process can be one instance of the word editor program.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.890
Here, you're displaying some notes from a previous lecture.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.357
And perhaps you're just reviewing it, you're not really modifying this.

00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:10.430
And then you can have a second process, another instance of

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.600
the exact same word editor program to take notes from this lecture.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.230
Given that we just started, this probably doesn't have many notes,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.300
so it has relatively small state, and it may have some unsaved edits.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.210
So, process therefore represents the execution state of an active application.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.830
It doesn't mean necessarily that it's running.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.310
It may be waiting on input like user input to type in certain notes.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.380
Or it may be waiting for another process that's currently running on the CPU,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.510
in case there's just one CPU in the system.
