00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.570
So we have already seen
that a multiprocessor

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.720
can easily win in performance nowadays,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.580
assuming that you have a program
that can use multiple cores.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.600
So there are some
disadvantages to going to

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.870
multiprocessors from
single core processors.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.250
One is that the so-called sequential or
single-threaded code is easier

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.810
to develop for programmers, and
actually it's a lot easier to develop.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.370
So there is significant
cost involved in making

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.570
an application multithreaded where
originally it was single-threaded.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.310
Even when you do write a parallel
application you will have some bugs.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.920
The debugging of parallel code is much
more difficult than sequential code,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.900
and even if you have a program
that works correctly and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.350
uses a lot of threads,
chances are that it will still be

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.140
very hard to get what is
called performance scaling.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.630
And performance scaling is
a property of the program that,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.270
as we increase the number of cores,
if its overall performance

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.805
keeps improving,
this will be ideal performance scaling.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.890
You'll get more performance in
proportion to the number of

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.450
cores you are given.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.390
Unfortunately, most programs, when you
write them, do something like this,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.780
they scale for while and
then stop scaling and

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.150
eventually you stop getting more
performance from the number of cores.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.930
You can spend a lot of time
improving this program and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.210
get something like this, where it
scales up to some larger number of

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.470
cores reasonably well, but
each of these increments in scaling

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.810
is going to result in a lot of work for
you to achieve it.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.460
And very, very few programs achieve
good scaling to a huge number of cores,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.190
and those that do usually
took years to develop.
