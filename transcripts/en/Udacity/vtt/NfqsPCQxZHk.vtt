00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want you to analyze the running time of Dijkstra and ideally, I would just ask you

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but given that you can't answer me directly,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm going to have to make this a multiple choice question.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And it turns out that you don't have enough information to answer it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So for you to be able to answer it, what were do you need to know.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So the running time of Dijkstra in terms of n and M and here's a sketch of the algorithm again.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Remember for each node it finds the shortest distance so far--it removes that distance

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
from the set and then it checks each of the neighbors.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I've got a node that it found the shortest node--it does a little bit of competition--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
constant competition for each of those before going up and starting again with another node.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But you will have enough to answer this question--is it because the running time depends

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
on how find shortest is implemented, is that because it depends on the degree of the nodes

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in question or is it because it depends if the graph is dense or sparse.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You'll get a different answer in those cases. So just check which one and I'll give you some feedback.
