00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.704
Swift is statically typed.

00:00:01.704 --> 00:00:04.982
The type of every entities
known at compile time.

00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:09.359
Objective-C, uses a combination
of static and dynamic typing.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.929
The types of the majority of objects
are declared at compiled time.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.849
In fact, it's required that
every object have a type.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.289
But sometimes,
the type that's declared is id.

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:21.500
The id type is somewhat sneaky.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.629
It's kind of like an amorphous
blob that stands in for any type.

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:30.259
Declaring an object of type id is kind
of like writing to be determined.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.060
When an entity is declared
with the type id,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.719
a more meaningful type is determined at
run time, in other words, dynamically.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:39.519
Here's an example.
