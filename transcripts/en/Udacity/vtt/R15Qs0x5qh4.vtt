00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.268
Let's look at the first one. This variable declaration says var x equals 13.

00:00:04.268 --> 00:00:08.760
Well, var isn't a type that we've seen yet. So it looks like the answer is D.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.940
The variable has a bad type. Let's look at the next one. Int X equals in

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.670
quotation marks 13. Well, int usually takes a number. And 13 is actually a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.300
string. So it looks like these don't match. So the answer is c. The variable

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.910
type doesn't match the initial value type. The next one, double x equals 13.0.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.740
Well, we're missing the semicolon. That was an option. Looks like F. Int lucky

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.580
number equals 13. That one's a little bit trickier, but it looks like there's a

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.890
space in what we meant to be our variable name, lucky number. We can't have

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.580
spaces in variable names. they can only contain letters and numbers, so that

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.700
would be a, x equals 13. Well, we don't know if this is right or not because we

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.120
don't know if x is actually an int. The answer is g, variable declarations must

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.280
have types. Int x, we haven't given any initial value. It's always a good idea

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.503
to include an initial value. Int lucky number equals 13. This one looks good to

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:12.798
me, so there is no mistake.
