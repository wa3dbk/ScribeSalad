00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.710
There are essentially two parts to
building a Discriminative System.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.700
We have to build an object model
that is a representation of each

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.750
of the training instances.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.410
And here we're going to
be talking about images.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.310
The methods that I'm going to show you
of course, the overall classification

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.570
method could be applied to future
vectors from all sorts of things.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.630
That in fact if you take
a machine learning class,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.960
many of you already have.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.230
You learned about discriminative
classification for arbitrary.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.500
vectors, so we'll spend a little bit of
time talking about features that come

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.119
from a computer vision or
an image element.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.110
Right?
So you would use them for

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.040
biological data of describing genomes.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.900
But the representation you might
apply to other kinds of pictures.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.950
So you have to build that model.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.320
And the second thing you have to do
is you have to train the classifier.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.570
Then when you run this thing, what you
have to do is you have to figure out,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.840
I need to generate new
candidates to test.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.850
So I give you a picture.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.830
What does it mean to say,
tell me, you know, what's in it.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.650
Is it the whole picture,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.850
parts of the picture,
we'll talk about that in a minute.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.330
And then once I generate candidates
I'm going to have to score them.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.250
I have to evaluate them with
a classifier of yay or nay.
