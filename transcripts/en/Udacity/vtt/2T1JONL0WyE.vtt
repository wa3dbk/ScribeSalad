00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.590
So for this quiz, I want you to think carefully about a strategy that will be

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.018
the most effective way to finish the problem. We've got a lot of different

00:00:07.018 --> 00:00:10.760
things we might do next. We don't necessarily need to do all of these, and the

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.420
order in which we do them will make a big difference in how efficiently and

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.192
correctly we solve the problem. So, I want you to think about this and give an

00:00:18.192 --> 00:00:21.796
answer that lists the steps you would do in order. And an example to show you

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:25.300
the format for the answer is just to put the letters in order. This is not a

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.265
correct answer, but note that you can include some of the steps more than once,

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:33.017
and you don't need to include all of the steps. This is pretty tricky, and I

00:00:33.017 --> 00:00:36.821
don't expect you to match exactly what I think the best answer is. But there's

00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:40.649
several different ways to answer this that would be accepted, and you should be

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.119
able to come up with one of those. So, see if you can order these steps.
