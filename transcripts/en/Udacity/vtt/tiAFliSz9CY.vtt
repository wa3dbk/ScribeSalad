00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.469
So, to see that we understand the problem well, let's work out some examples.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.093
For each of the examples, give the expected output or write undefined if there's

00:00:08.093 --> 00:00:12.350
no defined output. Meaning, the inputs given were not valid. There are five

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.479
examples, the first is from December 7th, 2012 to the December 7th, 2012. The second is from

00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:22.960
December 7th, 2012 to December 8th, 2012. The third is from December 8th, 2012

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.851
to December 7th, 2012. The fourth is from June 29, 2012 to June 29, 2013. And

00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:34.010
the final one is from June 29, 2012 to June 31st, 2013.
