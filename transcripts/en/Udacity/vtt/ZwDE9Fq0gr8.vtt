The first one is d. The second one is b. The third one is a. And the fourth one

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:12.224
is c. Using equals instead of equals equals or .equals is an easy mistake to

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:17.318
make. This won't compile. If I create a string friends, and set it equal to the

00:00:17.318 --> 00:00:22.318
empty string. And now, if friends is the empty screen. And I'm going to use

00:00:22.318 --> 00:00:27.226
Shift Enter to go down a line without running it. Then I'll print out no

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:31.610
friends left. Now if I run this, I get an error incompatible types, because

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.148
friends equals the empty string, isn't a condition. It can't go inside of an if

00:00:37.148 --> 00:00:42.299
check. In the second one, friends will never be null. No matter how many

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:46.329
friends we remove we just erase their names from the string, we don't reset the

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.697
string to be null. In this third one, we're comparing using equals, equals. But

00:00:52.697 --> 00:00:58.052
strings are objects so we always want to use dot equals to compare them. In

00:00:58.052 --> 00:01:01.773
this last one, we say if the number of friends equals, equals the number of

00:01:01.773 --> 00:01:06.511
people times 0.33. Then you're friends with one in three people. But these are

00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:12.370
doubles, and doubles have precision loss. So, you could actually find out that

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.034
numFriends equals numPeople times 0.33333 or 0.339, or something like that, and

00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:25.309
this wouldn't be true. Even though that person is basically friends with one in

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:29.817
three people. When comparing doubles, you always want to find the difference

00:01:29.817 --> 00:01:35.769
between them, and then compare it to a threshold. Pick an epsilon, that is the

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:40.917
biggest difference you want to accept, and compare the actual difference with

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:43.379
your epsilon.
