00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.445
The vertical and horizontal asymptotes of this rational function divide the

00:00:03.445 --> 00:00:08.720
coordinate plane into four different sections. Which of these four sections

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.226
does the graph lie in? Check off the proper boxes to show approximately the

00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:15.230
points that the graph is going to go through.
