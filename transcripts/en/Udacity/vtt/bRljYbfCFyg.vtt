00:00:00.084 --> 00:00:03.914
Well for the atomic only technique, we're going to have 256 threads,

00:00:03.914 --> 00:00:06.053
each of which has to increment one bin.

00:00:06.053 --> 00:00:08.998
So we know we're going to need 256 increments.

00:00:08.998 --> 00:00:13.320
However, if we do all of our reduction within the block, with no atomics necessary,

00:00:13.327 --> 00:00:16.907
and only after we've reduced to a single 8-element histogram, only

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:21.270
each 1 of those 8 elements must update the global histogram with an atomic

00:00:21.277 --> 00:00:24.053
to be able to complete the histogram calculation.

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:29.259
So, this is potentially a large savings in atomics, which is in turn going to help your performance.
