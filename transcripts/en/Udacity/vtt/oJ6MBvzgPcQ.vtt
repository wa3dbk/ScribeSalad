00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.300
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I want to add a little more about user

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.984
agents. So it's, it's one of the most important headers in

00:00:05.984 --> 00:00:08.810
an HTTP request. And when we were doing Reddit, user agents

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.090
were really important to us. So we had the site that was

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.070
online and really popular. And users were always you know, often

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.762
writing scripts to, to pull content out on Reddit. And, you

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:21.920
know, mostly they were doing good things. They were building you

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.330
know, tools to, you know, do data collections so they can do

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.730
some, you know, cool blog post about how Reddit works and that sort

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.920
of thing. Sometimes they're doing bad things.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.220
You know, there are spammers, you know,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.820
looking for weaknesses or, you know, looking for ways to game the system.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.260
And user agents are important because sometimes, you know, a user would hit us

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.370
a little too hard too fast, you know, basically, you know, hurting the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.990
website for real users. And if they had a legitimate user agent, we could

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.110
look at them. We can you know, rate limit them accordingly or we can

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.020
reach out to them and say, hey you know, you are hurting us and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.820
you know, they, they would adjust, and it's cool. The Googlebot is

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.256
a really good example of this. The Googlebot is Google's WebCrawler that indexes

00:00:58.256 --> 00:01:02.810
website for, you know, their search engine. Googlebot would just punish us.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.030
They would hit us as fast as they could, and sometimes that would

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.454
actually slow down the site. And until we learned how to handle

00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:10.820
that properly, we would just, you know, rate limit them a little bit.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.730
And, you know, Googlebot, you know, their feelings weren't hurt, they can

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.030
still index the site. We just made them do it slower. But when

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.540
people show up with fake user agents and we can tell that,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.690
you know, this one IP and this one user agent is just

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.910
pummeling us and, and they're trying to pretend to be a browser,

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.730
we would just block them altogether. So, using good user agents when you're

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.260
writing software that, interacts with other people's websites is, is a really

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.442
nice, courteous thing to do. And it's one of the things that

00:01:34.442 --> 00:01:38.470
makes the web work well for everybody. So it's always important to

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.019
have a nice accurate user agent and to be honest when you can.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.060
&gt;&gt; Okay, now that I'd like you to do is promise

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.360
to always use user agents appropriately when you're writing your web software.
