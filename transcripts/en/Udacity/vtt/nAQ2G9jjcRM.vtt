Finally let's return to working with Grant. He had just shown us this new

00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:09.309
equation that he'd come up with, that he thinks properly describes the

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.515
trajectory of his fountain. The equation is y equals negative 7 x squared plus

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:19.587
14 x minus 10. First off, I'd like to know where the vertex of this parabola is.

00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:21.946
Fill in the coordinates right here.
