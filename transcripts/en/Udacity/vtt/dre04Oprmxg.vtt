00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.596
When we think about the distance between two points, we want to picture a right

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:08.562
triangle. The hypotenuse is the distance between them, and then we have the

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:13.050
horizontal distance as one leg and the vertical distance between the points as

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.478
another leg. We can use this right triangle to solve for any distance D. So,

00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:24.495
what do you think is the distance between these two points? Write that answer

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:25.010
here.
