00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.413
This ellipse would be centered at negative 2 negative 3 would have an a value

00:00:05.413 --> 00:00:11.324
of 4 and a, b value of 2. Great work if you found all 3. For the center we take

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:16.548
the opposite signs of what's next the x and the y in the parenthesis. Ellipse

00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:20.895
so for x we'll have negative 2 for the x coordinate at the center and negative

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:26.673
3 for the y coordinate of the center. Remember this really shifts an ellipse

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:31.526
centered at the origin two units left and then three units down. So, this is

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:36.124
how we know our center is here. Next we take the square root of 16, which is

00:00:36.124 --> 00:00:40.637
our a value. Remember a squared is always underneath the x squared term for

00:00:40.637 --> 00:00:45.451
ellipses. And to find b, we take the square root of the denominator of the y

00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:51.288
term. So, the square root of 4 equals 2. From our center we can move four units

00:00:51.288 --> 00:00:56.238
left and right to get these two points on our ellipse. And from our center we

00:00:56.238 --> 00:01:01.366
can move two units up and down to get two additional points on our ellipse. And

00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.694
if we look closely at the points that are vertically aligned with the center,

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:07.866
we can see that one point is two units above the center and another point is

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.910
two units below the center.
