Why is it a good not to tell the participants what group they're in? Is it

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.450
because they will try to sneak into another group? It reduces bias because they

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.430
may change how they react if they know if they are or are not getting the

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.970
independent variable? Or it won't change anything. They should know what group

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.466
they're in. Choose whatever answer you think is correct.
