00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here we are on that Welcome page.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If I reload this page, we keep seeing the same thing.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The last thing I asked you to do was implement "Log out"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So this URL, when you go to it, redirects you to the "Sign up" page.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If I were to go back to the "Welcome page" and reload this,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
it redirects us to the "Sign up" page because our cookie has been deleted.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The way you log somebody out is you delete that cookie.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I didn't say that in the lecture. Hopefully you managed to figure that out.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's go ahead and see that in action again.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's log in. You can see we have a cookie. The user ID cookie equals 5.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That's the user ID for spez in this machine.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If I go to logout, and we go look at our cookie again,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we can see that the user ID is the user ID cookie.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's just blank. There is the user ID cookie. There's nothing in it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's how "Logout" works. Let's look at the code for this.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The first thing we have is our "Logout" handler.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So I map slash logout to the logout handler.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
When we look at the "logout handler" you can see it calls "self dot logout"

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which is the Find up on Blog Handler and it redirects the Signup.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Let's look at this Logout function. Here it is. Remember we are in Class Blog Handler

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
where I've put all this helpful generic stuff that other Handlers may use.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
All Logoff does is it sets the cookie User ID to nothing.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Instead of setting Cookie = Value, we just set Cookie = Nothing

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and we keep the same path so we're setting and overwriting the same cookie.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If we didn't have these path variables here, or this path parameter here on the cookie,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
we would actually overwrite the--well, we might set the cookie on

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
slash login or slash signup to default where you're on,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and then when you go to the Welcome page you wouldn't be logged in.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That would cause problems so we make sure we set the cookie on path slash

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and we delete the cookie off of path slash.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And that's how Logout works.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If you got all that you did a very good job.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
One of the more complicated things you do when you're writing

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
web apps is all this kind of cookie and hashing and all that manipulation,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but you can also start doing some really clever things.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
While a lot of frameworks do a lot of this for you, I think it's really important

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to understand how it works because you'll often find yourself in a situation

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
where you need to hide some data in a cookie or maybe have a

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
special type of hash that represents some piece of information and that sort of thing.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We do that on Reddit all the time for anti-cheating stuff.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Knowing how this all fits together I think is really important.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
That's why I made you do all this.
