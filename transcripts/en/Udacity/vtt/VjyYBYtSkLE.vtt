00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.233
Well, the entire curve sits in this part of the graph, starting at the y-axis

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:08.591
and moving to the right. So, that means the smallest x value we have on this

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:12.218
curve is 0. And then it's going to continue to increase with corresponding

00:00:12.218 --> 00:00:15.634
values of the function for every value of x that gets higher and higher and

00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:19.672
higher. So that means, that domain is going to increase forever in this

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:24.095
direction, and the domain of g of x, must me all number between 0 and infinity.
