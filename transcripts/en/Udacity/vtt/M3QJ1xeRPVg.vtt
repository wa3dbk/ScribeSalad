00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.586
Well, we know 1 hour and 4 minutes would be hour and 4 60ths of an hour. 4

00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:09.994
minutes is just 4 60ths of an hour, since an hour can be broken up into 60

00:00:09.994 --> 00:00:15.392
minutes. 4 60ths simplifies to 1 15th, since there's a common factor of four

00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:20.464
and the numerator and in the denominator. And then finally to add these two

00:00:20.464 --> 00:00:27.084
numbers together, we can change one to be 15 15th. This gives us a total sum of

00:00:27.084 --> 00:00:29.138
16 15ths hours.
