00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.550
Now I'll actually talk about one specific form of an edge detector.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.040
Perhaps the most widely used edge detector out there,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.050
referred to as the Canny edge detector.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.810
You start off by filtering the image with a derivative of a Gaussian.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.100
Remember, the whole concept of, actually, you can actually just

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.140
apply the Gaussian to the derivative operator and generate a new kernel.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.870
And that's what this process is about.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.540
Basically, we would actually filter the image with a derivative of a Gaussian.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.780
And that will give us a magnitude and orientation of the gradient.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.350
So this is my original image.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.570
These are the two derivatives in x and y.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.720
Again, just for showcasing purposes, I'm showing you some results.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.120
They are not the actual outputs all of this using this process, but

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.910
I want to make sure that you guys understand what's going on here more

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.384
rather than actually giving you the actual outputs.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.454
This is, of course, the magnitude of the gradient.

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:58.450
And, of course, the, the angle, the orientation of the gradient everywhere.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.360
We've looked at how to compute all of this so far.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.070
So these are the first two steps.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.530
The third step of computing edges is, again,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.960
taking this magnitude and doing some local processing to enhance the edges.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.180
So in Canny edge detector, what basically is done is non-maximum suppression.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.180
Which basically is all about thinning the multiple pixels.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.970
So there are lots of pixels, for example, here you see right next to each other.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.150
And taking these into a single pixel width line.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.030
So anywhere where I see a lot of these types of regions that seem to have more

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.600
than one pixel, we want to kind of start combining them into single pixels and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.430
lines of single pixels.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.900
These are, again, approximations to kind of look at what's going on.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.640
But basically, in essence, it comes down to, just take the wide ridges,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.980
remember those ridges from the way we've looked at a height map of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.300
these types of things, and reduce them down to something that's one pixel width.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.580
The fourth step in Canny edge detector is taking the gradient image again and

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.120
coming with a method of both linking and

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.750
thresholding pixel groupings from one level to the other.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.460
So in essence, what we do is, anywhere out there we would define two thresholds.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.390
These two thresholds would be the low value and the high value.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.910
And then use the high threshold to start an edge.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.960
So wherever there's a high value information.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.470
again, this is just for demonstration purposes.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.840
I would, let's say find the high value here.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.970
I would start the curve at this thing.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.622
And basically, anywhere in the thing wherever I find low values,

00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:33.640
I'll continue finding the curve.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.980
So using this kind of a technique,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.690
we can actually start kind of building more local edges out of it.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.530
Doing this process and kind of doing various types of filtering mechanisms to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.500
keep on enhancing them within the thresholding that's going on,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.630
we should be able to generate a edge map.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.110
So here you see now a complete edge map.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.640
All of the edges are one pixel.

00:02:56.706 --> 00:02:59.513
Sometimes they form complete lines out of it.

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:03.211
Of course, this is still an image, and these are not line segments per se, but

00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:06.742
then there are other methods that can be used to actually combine these into

00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:09.377
line segments, you know, Hough transform methods and

00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:11.790
stuff that you can read about on your own.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.130
And we will not cover them.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.970
We will actually come back at looking these types these types of edges for

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.980
some other work in a later lecture.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.310
This, of course, is the actual output of edges of the original tiger image that

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.400
we were looking at.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.570
Just to reiterate, these were the steps we went through.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.480
We filtered the image using a derivative for Gaussian,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.700
found the gradient information, did non-maximum suppression to find the ridges,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.860
down to single pixels, then once we took these single pixels,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.620
we started linking and thresholding the images, or, the the edges.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.800
We're basically looking at the low and high and use the high threshold to

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.692
start edge curves and the low ones to continue it to get an output like this.
