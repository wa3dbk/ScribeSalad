00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.520
In the following videos, we're going to do an aside on information theory and

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.770
how it's used in data science, specifically with regard to feature selection.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.690
The purpose of this video is to equip you with the necessary background

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.519
knowledge to use information theory as a tool in the future.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.830
In the next video, we'll go back to building our inter Tweet time predictor, and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.800
how we can apply information theory to it.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.990
Information theory is a field of computer science developed by

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.430
Claude Shannon while working at AT&amp;T's Bell labs to understand how to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.060
send reliable digital signals.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.680
It quantifies the notion of the amount of information contained in a message.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.630
The science of information theory is a powerful tool used all the time by

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.830
data scientists to understand the relationship between parameters.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.730
I want to give an overview of what information theory is all about and

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.470
how it's used in data science.
