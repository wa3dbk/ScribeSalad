00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.755
This is fairly straightforward. We can see that the vertex is at negative 3,

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:11.411
negative 1. And if we look at how wide the parabola is, we see that it follows

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:17.401
the normal parent parabola. The equation is y plus 1 equals the quantity x plus

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:18.267
3 squared.
