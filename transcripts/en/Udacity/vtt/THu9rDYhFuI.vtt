Looking at the demo, you should have noticed that when you pull the red box to

00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:07.490
be closer to you, suddenly you can't see it through the yellow object. You can

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.845
see the ground playing grid through the red object, but the red object has

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:15.560
disappeared. Which of these is true for this picture? More than one answer can

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.332
be correct. The red object is rendered after the yellow object. Blending has

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:23.820
been turned off for the yellow object. The yellow object was not drawn to the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.563
Z-buffer. The red object is closer to the eye than the yellow one.
