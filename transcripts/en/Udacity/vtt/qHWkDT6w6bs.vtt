00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.500
The PTS Programming Model is very simple

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.400
and straightforward. It's a distributed application and in

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.150
the distributed application, there are threads and

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.120
channels. These are the two high level abstractions

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.230
provided in the programming model. And the

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.520
computation graph that you generate using the PTS

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.690
programming model, in particular the extractions thread

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.760
and channel provided with the PTS programming model.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.130
The computation graph looks very similar to a UNIX process socket graph.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.860
So in terms of a transition for a programmer that is familiar with the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.980
socket API. To transition to programming,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.160
using the abstractions provided by PTS, is

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.820
not significant. While the computation graph

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.660
looks similar to a process socket graph,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.150
the semantics of the channel abstraction is

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.320
very different from the socket abstraction. In

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.570
particular, what the channel holds are time

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.489
sequenced data objects. So a thread is generating

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.890
time sequence data objects can place those

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.530
time sequence data objects into the channel.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.270
The other thing you will also notice

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.390
from the structure of this computation graph that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.650
there could be multiple producers of data that go into a given channel And

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.480
similarly, there could be multiple consumers of

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.630
data that are getting data from a given

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.830
channel. Or, in other words, a channel allows many to many connections. A thread

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.880
that produces some data and wants to put it into a channel uses the primitive

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.480
provided for. Operating on the channel, namely the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.520
put item primitive and the put item takes two

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.322
arguments, one is the item itself, which is

00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:57.450
whatever the application decides as the content of the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.830
data that it wants to put in the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.900
channel. The time stamp that it can associate with

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.370
the data that it is producing and placing in

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.419
the channel. So if you look at the contents

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:13.730
of any given channel, it's really showing a temporal evolution of data that is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.830
being produced by a particular thread. For

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.430
example, this thread could be capturing data from

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.220
a camera and every item that it produces is one frame of image captured from

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.060
the camera associated with the wall clock

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.340
time. At which that particular frame was captured.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.000
A computation that is needing to use the data will do a get on a channel and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.885
when it does a get on a channel it actually has to specify two arguments. One is

00:02:47.885 --> 00:02:53.280
a lower bound for a time stamp that it is looking for and an upper bound. Or

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.520
in other words a thread that wishes to

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.370
get data from this channel, for instance, will specify

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.610
in the get primitive that I want to get the data that is in a particular channel

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.622
starting at a particular time. Say 1:05 p.m., To an upper bound, 1:06

00:03:11.622 --> 00:03:17.920
p.m. And what the thread is going to get back is all the items that this

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.250
channel contains between this lower bound and upper

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.460
bound. The programming model also allows an application

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.720
to specify time variables in an abstract way. It could say, I want the oldest

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.600
item from a channel, or the newest item from the channel. In addition

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.540
to specifying explicit lower bound and upper bound markers if it so chooses.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.520
So in other words, a channel contains a continuous stream of data that have been

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.370
snapshotted with different time stamps associated with them. So, this is the way

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.560
one could write a program that uses the primitives provided by the PTS

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.450
programming model. Let's say we are writing the code for a detector

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.669
that is looking at video stream produced by a particular camera. In that case,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.310
the detector will associate a variable channel one with

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.704
the video stream that corresponds to what that camera's producing.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.262
And continuously what it is going to do is, it

00:04:31.262 --> 00:04:37.400
is going to get a camera image from that particular channel. And

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.280
it might specify a lower bound and an upper bound in terms of time that it is

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:49.140
looking for. Process the data, produce an output, and it might place the output.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.820
That it produced as a digest of information that it processed into another

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.310
channel, and it'll do that by putting the digest as a new item, and

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.490
associate a time stamp. This is a place where the programming model facilitates.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.860
Temporal causality to be propagated in the

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.380
distributed system. So if this thread is

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.280
a detector thread that is looking at

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.844
the camera images produced by a camera thread,

00:05:20.844 --> 00:05:26.650
then it can take the camera images, process it. And place it in its

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.882
output channel, and when it places it in the output channel, it can use the same

00:05:31.882 --> 00:05:36.750
time stamp that it got for an input image in doing the put

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.200
operation, and that way, there is simple

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.860
causality that is being propagated through this

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.713
graph by the computation using the primitive that

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:51.990
is available from this PTS programming system. Quite often in

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.320
situation awareness application, the computation may have to use data

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.760
from several different streams in order to

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.180
do its high-level inferencing. So a particular thread

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.310
may get information from several different streams,

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.560
and it may have to make high level

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.279
inference based on the composite results that

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:15.600
it is getting from all these schemes. And

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.160
since all the data that is coming from

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.250
the channels have time stamps associated with them,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.530
an intermediate computation like this that is

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.440
taking multiple streams and generating a high

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.750
level inference from it, can use the time stamps in the incoming streams to see

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.825
which data items in these streams are

00:06:36.825 --> 00:06:40.750
temporally correlated with one another. And use that

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.030
information to improve the kind of inferencing

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.300
and hypothesis that can be derived in the

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.840
situation awareness application. So in a

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.040
nutshell, the PTS programming model, what it

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:59.070
allows, is the ability to associate time stamp with data items produced by

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:06.040
a computation. So the model allows propagation of temporal causality because the

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:13.030
fact that a computation can associate a time stamp with an item that it produces

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:18.600
based on the time stamp that it got. On the data that it obtained

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.920
from its input channel and thirdly the fact that every stream is temporally

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.690
indexed allows a computation to correlate

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.580
the incoming streams. And recognize which data

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.090
items in the input streams are temporally related to one another by looking at

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.130
the time stamps associated with the items

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.940
that it is fetching from the different channels.
