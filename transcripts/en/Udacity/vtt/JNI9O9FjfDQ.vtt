00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] Here's 1 possible solution if we iterate the following loop 1000 times

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we create an object called robot, and we append this object to our growing list P,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and when we're done we have 1000 particles,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and let me do something I might regret,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which is let me just print out this entire set of particles with print P,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and what I get is 1000 items that look just like this over here.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If you have an X, a Y, and a heading direction all generated at random.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So, if you look through those you'll find there's a lot those.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So, we now have a set of 1000 particles,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
each of which just looks like one of these dots over here,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and each of which has exactly 3 values associated,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.807
an X, a Y, and an orientation.
