00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.760
The two possible values for the font-style property are italic and normal.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.800
Also, in order to make the text look bold,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.250
you would use the font weight property.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.920
Looking at this in the CSS documentation, we find under the values heading,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.200
we can set values normal, italic and oblique.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.300
And in the documentation for the font-weight property under Values we can find

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.769
normal, bold, lighter, bolder and set a numeric font-weight.
