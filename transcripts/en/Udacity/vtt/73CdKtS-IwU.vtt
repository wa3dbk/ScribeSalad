Before you get started becoming
a machine learning engineer, I'd like to

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.670
briefly handed over to Merriam, our
director of student services, to provide

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.950
some critical information about how
your nano-degree program will work.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.210
This should only take
a couple minutes and

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.820
they will get started with
the real machine learning.
