00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:02.703
Here's an example of some simple BLAS code.

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:08.842
First we initialize N to 2 to the 20th, or about a million, and then we perform SAXPY.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:13.185
Remember, SAXPY--the S single precision, and that stands for AX plus Y.

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:17.286
So we're going to set Y equal to AX plus Y by calling SAXPY,

00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:21.156
and we're going to do this on a million elements, or more exactly, M elements.

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:27.282
So here we're going to say Y is equal to A, which is 2.0, times X plus Y.

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:29.332
This is the original BLAS code.

00:00:29.332 --> 00:00:32.836
If we want to run this on the GPU, then the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:35.404
change the comment at the top.

00:00:35.404 --> 00:00:38.310
So the first thing we're going to do after we change the comment at the top

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.814
is add a CUBLAS Prefix and change these to be device variables.

00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:47.118
Next we need to initialize CUBLAS and shut it down again when we're done.

00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:51.454
And now we need to allocate those device vectors and free them when we're done.

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:57.329
Finally, we need to set the vectors, so copying the data over to the GPU, and get the result back.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.933
Okay, so by the addition of just a few lines, we've accelerated this using CUBLAS,

00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:06.815
and I'll point out that of course, if you were doing more than just this one simple SAXPY operation,

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:09.007
you'd probably leave the intermediate results.

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:13.585
You wouldn't keep setting and getting your vectors back and forth to the CPU.

00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:17.445
You would do some operation, then you'd use the results to do the next operation and so forth.

00:01:17.445 --> 00:01:20.814
So a lot of this overhead really only appears once

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:24.000
at the beginning and end of your calculation.
