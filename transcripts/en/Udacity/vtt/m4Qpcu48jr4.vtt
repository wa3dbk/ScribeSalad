00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If you look at the bar graph, what you'll find is it's a much finer representation of the data.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
By pooling together multiple data points into an individual bar,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you can see that there is a much better way to really understand

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the dependence of cost to data.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
While the bar doesn't give you the linear relationship--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in fact, in this case, happens to be nonlinear--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
it really gives you a sense as you go up in house sizes

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the cost increases, which wasn't obvious from looking at the individual data points.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What the bar chart does is it really helps you to pool together groups of data

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
into a single bar and understand global trends.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Such global trends might not be that important if you only have six data points,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but imagine you have 60,000.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
With 60,000 data points, you're scatter plot may look like this.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I can tell you my hand isn't really able to draw 60,000 points.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If you go to look at this data set,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the individual data tells you very little, jumping in x parameter by a tiny bit

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
might make a jump in y from here to here down to here to here and at some point down to here.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Yet a bar graph can really help you understand the data.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Clearly, one of the things that a statistician does is to use cumulative tools,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
such as bar graphs, to gain an understanding of the underlying data.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Let me ask you. Are bar charts cool?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Just check one of the two answers.
