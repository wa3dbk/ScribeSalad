00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.609
Putting a negative sign out in front of the entire function means we're going

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:07.900
to reflect the function in the x-axis. Let's take a look at our graphs,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.262
finally. So here we have our progression starting with our first function, f(x)

00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:18.826
equals x cubed. Then we translate it to the right by 1. To give us f of x

00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:24.802
equals the quantity x minus 1 cubed. And then finally, we reflect this in the x

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:29.889
axis, giving us f of x equals negative x minus 1 cubed.
