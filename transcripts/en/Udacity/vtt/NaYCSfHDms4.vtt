00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.560
So now your app gets the data special
out of the tag manager container.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.800
When you update the daily special
variable in tag manager and

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.900
republish the container your
app picks up the changes.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.160
But what if your user
doesn't speak English?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.850
Wouldn't it be nice for them to see
the daily special in their own language?

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.710
&gt;&gt; Why didn't you say so before?

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.755
Now I'm going to have to
update the code in my app.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.750
&gt;&gt; Don't worry.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.150
No code updates needed.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.680
Seriously, to make this change you
don't need to update your code.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.535
We can handle it all in tag
manager using a built-in variable.

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:38.240
So come with me and we'll delve into the
wonderful world of built-in variables.
