00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.530
Now that I've shown you,

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.680
that we can easily remove an add circles, based on some selection.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.960
Let's get to the last piece that our update function needs to perform.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.090
As I mentioned previously in the lesson, we want to highlight which

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.700
countries participated in the given year of the World Cup, and hide every other.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.280
To do this, rather than removing and adding paths of countries, I'll simply

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.150
change their fill and stroke, accordingly, depending on whether or not,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.770
the country for the given year of World Cup, is present in our teams array.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.660
Remember, in our nested object previously, we used a d3 set,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.230
to create a list of the teams that played for a given year.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.990
Since every path has previously been bound toward GeoJSON country data,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.660
included in that data,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.550
are properties such as the name of the country in addition to their coordinates.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.260
We can simply selectively update a give path,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.000
based on the accessor function we used.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.500
In our animation, we'll be leveraging negative space to highlight which

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.530
countries played in each year.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.958
In other words, if a country is not in a current year,

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.500
that we're updating, simply make it white.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.950
And if it is, keep it the light blue we've made it.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.078
Going through some of the code I just added.

00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:32.630
First we want to get a list of the countries that participated in the given year

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.610
they were updating, which we can access through the filtered data.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.560
Get the first and only element,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.160
access the values property, that was created when you used the nested object.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.220
And then select the teams array.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.280
So in this case,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.550
countries is an array of strings corresponding to the names of the countries.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.110
And the code that I'm running here, while slightly complicated,

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.860
is easy to understand once you break it down.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.015
Every JavaScript array, has this method index of defined on it, which,

00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:12.670
if its argument is contained in the array, returns the index in which it is

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.460
present, and if it is not contained in the array, it simply returns negative 1.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.160
Again, remember, every path has GeoJSON bound to it.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.240
Every GeoJSON, in this case d, has properties defined on it.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.692
And inside the properties object, it has a name.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:33.100
So altogether,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.870
this has the effect of going through every path with corresponds to a country.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.510
For each of those, compares the name of that country,

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.360
to the teams in our countries array for a given year, and if it's present,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.780
keep that country light blue.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.160
If it's not present, turn it white, effectively hiding it.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.950
And since we'll be doing the same thing with our stroke property,

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.010
we can abstract this function outside, of the style fill.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.580
And as you can see here, now that I've created an update countries function,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.970
I can simply pass that, to both the fill update and the stroke update.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.936
Let's save this and inspect our complete update function,

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:21.350
in the web console, before we animate for all the years.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.130
Again, let's start to update it this time.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.450
For the most recent World Cup, the year 2014, when we ran update in the console,

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.370
again, right at the bottom of the plot points function.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.180
We can see that many of the countries have been turned into white, but

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.900
many of the countries have remained blue.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.690
Closing the bugger, we can see here that what's shown for a given year.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.490
Are all of the countries, that participated in the given World Cup, which was

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.170
held in the home country indicated, with attendance indicated by the circle.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.280
Now that our update function is complete, let's animate this so

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.490
it cycles through every year of the World Cup.
