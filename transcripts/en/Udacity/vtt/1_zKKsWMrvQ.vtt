00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
There's a complexity that comes from combinatorial problems.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We've seen that before.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In the cryptarithmetic problems ODD + ODD = EVEN.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We had these up to 10! different permutations of digits to assign,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and it was complex because we had to consider them all.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In the zebra puzzle we had 5!^5 combinations to consider.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It was complex because it took a long time to consider them all.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We came up with an optimization to consider a few of them by going one at a time.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
For our pouring problem, we know there are 6 actions, 2 empties, 2 fills, and 2 pours.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The glasses are of size 4 and 9.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The goal is 6 oz.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I guess my question for you is how many combinations do we need?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
For cryptarithmetic it was 10!. For zebra it was 5!^5.

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For pouring is it 6^4, 6^(9-4), 6^6, or 6^9, or can't tell--none of the above?
