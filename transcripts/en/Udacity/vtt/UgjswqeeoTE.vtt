00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.810
In this lesson I'll be
talking about focus and

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.000
how you can manage it
in your application.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.119
Now in a nutshell, focus refers to
the control on the computer screen that

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.910
receives input from the keyboard and
from the clipboard when you paste.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.140
You're probably familiar with focus for
text fields.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.730
In order to type in a text field you
first have to go over with your mouse

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.740
and click on it.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.190
Well that act of clicking on the text
field, that's actually what focuses it.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.662
You may also know that if you then press
the tab key it will then move focus to

00:00:24.662 --> 00:00:26.682
the next text field or
available control.

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:29.766
Now some users drive the computer
entirely with the keyboard or

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.873
some other type of
discrete input device.

00:00:31.873 --> 00:00:34.526
For those users,
focus is absolutely critical.

00:00:34.526 --> 00:00:37.788
It's their primary means of
reaching everything on the screen.

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:41.069
And so for that reason the Web AIM
checklist states in section 2.1.1,

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:44.142
that all page functionality should
be available using the keyboard,

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:47.423
unless it's something you couldn't
normally do with a keyboard like free

00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:50.030
hand drawing or something like that.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.050
So this is a great place to start
learning about accessibility because

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.050
obviously we all know
how to use a keyboard.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.060
It's very easy to relate to and
test, and

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.200
it benefits virtually all of our users.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.160
There's users out there with motor
impairments which could be caused by

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.680
anything from paralysis or
even just a broken arm.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.700
Those folks may be relying on a keyboard
or switch device to navigate your page,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.040
so a good focus strategy is going
to be absolutely critical for them.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.920
And for the power users out there,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.900
those folks who know every keyboard
shortcut on their machine and

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.610
hate having to use the mouse, well,
for them, being able to navigate, for

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.580
instance, a form on your site, is just
going to make them more productive.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.120
So well-implemented focus strategy
means everyone using your application

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.980
will have a better experience.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.490
And as we'll see in
the next few lessons,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.550
the work that we do today on focus
is actually an important primer for

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.570
supporting assistive technology users.
