00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.240
So there's a time in almost every
business where you're going to

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.280
need to scale beyond what you have
available to you resource wise.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.700
And at this point, you have to reach
out to investors because otherwise,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.490
it's sink or swim.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.020
You won't be able to
get to that next level.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.220
You won't be able to grow or
scale your business,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.660
and sometimes without growth or
skill your business is in trouble.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.290
So at that point,
you want to bring an investor in.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.880
And in the case of one of my companies,
we had to bring an investor in because

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.290
we had to hire more people and we had
to scale up our technology production.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.680
And that was a very lengthy and
involved process overall.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.860
It took almost a year just to close
that first round of financing.
