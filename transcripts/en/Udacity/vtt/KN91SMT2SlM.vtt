00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.833
In the real world, bad things do happen, like files not being writeable or disks

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:07.232
being full. And we don't want our program to just crash one that happens, we

00:00:07.232 --> 00:00:11.218
want to deal with it. Many programming languages, including Python, provide a

00:00:11.218 --> 00:00:14.886
way of doing this and its called an exception. Here's an example of whats going

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:21.394
on. I'm going to open the file called blim.py to read from the current directory

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:26.895
and when I do this I get an error. The file didn't exist. And the error I got is

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:32.078
called an IOError. And it gives me a message. This is really a crash. I did this

00:00:32.078 --> 00:00:36.046
in the Python interpreter, but if this happened inside a program, well, that

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:40.062
would end execution and we'd be done. If we want our programs to work or at

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:44.278
least fail gracefully in the real world where things like this can happen,

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:48.430
instead of allowing this failure to happen, what we need to do is catch it.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.395
There's no way for open to return a file object, coz we asked for a file that

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:56.580
doesn't exist and that can't be read. So, there's no way to do this assignment.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.895
We can imagine a different interface to open where it would return null or some

00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:04.223
special object. And then, we'd have to test every time we did an open to see if

00:01:04.223 --> 00:01:07.260
it worked. Since we assume it normally works, we don't have to do that test all

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.053
the time. Instead, we want to deal with fillers like this as exceptional cases.

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:16.616
So, here's what happened in the example, we're calling the open operation which

00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:20.913
leads to call in the file module. Normally, that would return a file instance

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:24.880
which would be a sign to the variable f. In this case, something went wrong,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.650
there's no file that can be returned. Instead, what happens is an exception will

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.097
be thrown. This isn't a normal return. So, execution doesn't continue as it

00:01:33.097 --> 00:01:37.636
would with assignment, it continues somewhere else. Instead of being returned

00:01:37.636 --> 00:01:41.638
normally, this exception doesn't continue execution normally, it gets caught by

00:01:41.638 --> 00:01:45.846
an exception handler, if there is one. They can have more than five fingers. If

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:50.014
there are no exception handler, it causes the program to crash. And that's what

00:01:50.014 --> 00:01:53.794
we saw in interpreter and I am sure you've seen programs that end in that type

00:01:53.794 --> 00:01:57.956
of crash already. How do we make these handlers to try to prevent the program

00:01:57.956 --> 00:02:02.579
from crashing? To do that, we need a try catch block. Here's the syntax, we use

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.635
try to introduce a block, anything that happens in that block, if it raises an

00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:12.264
exception, it will jump to the exception handlers. If there's a handler that

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:15.558
matches the exception that was raised, and we'll talk more about how that

00:02:15.558 --> 00:02:19.160
matching happens, then the exception handler will run. So, we can jump from

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.255
anywhere in the middle of this block, wherever an exception is raised to the

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:25.387
handler that handles that exception.
