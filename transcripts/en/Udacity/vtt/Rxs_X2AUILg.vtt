00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.270
Now, look at your page and compare it to the design mock and

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.920
make sure that you go deeper than just a simple visual check.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.180
See if the defining parts are correct.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.780
The layout, margins, fonts, colors, etc.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:16.791
For example,

00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:22.190
does the image in the mock up look different than the image on your page?

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.260
In comparing the two,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.810
you can see that there's actually a space here and we dont' have a space here.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.970
You can use Dev Tools to find the proper value of the margin for

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.980
the image class.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.600
Once you've refined it in Dev Tools, you can then save it to your CSS file.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.860
You can look to the design mock to find this information.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.410
The background and color for the title is also incorrect.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.100
Now, often these colors are provided within the design document and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.390
you can see these small boxes on the left-hand side and

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.290
the color in a hex code is defined there.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.660
But you can also use different color-picker tools to get the same information.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.110
As you refine the design, answer the following questions, first,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.820
what margin size gets the design closer to the mock?

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.590
Also, what is the background color for the header?
