00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.246
The distance that I am away from the mean is 127. This means that 127 divided by

00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:14.568
36 will give us the number of standard deviations that 63 is from the mean. This

00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:21.874
is 3.53. So I am 3.53 standard deviations below the mean, in terms of the number

00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:23.604
of friends I have.
