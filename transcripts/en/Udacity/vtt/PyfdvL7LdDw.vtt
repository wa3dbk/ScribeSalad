00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.190
To rectify this situation, Microsoft made a standards

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.020
proposal that reconciles touch events and mouse events and

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.000
pen input too, into one model called pointer

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.750
events. So you'll notice that pointer events are currently

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.030
only natively implemented on Internet Explorer and IE

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.930
mobile. For all the other browsers out there, you're

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.920
going to need a poly fill library built on

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.520
top of touch events. Luckily, there's a great poly

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.180
fill library out there as part of the polymer project.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.710
This is what I used to implement pointer event handling

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.770
in my synthesizer. The set of pointer events should look

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.360
pretty familiar to you if you used mouse events before. They

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.400
basically map all the mouse events directly. And then add

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.750
the pointer cancel event from touch, as well. The pointer

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.610
event, itself, derives from mouse event. So it gets all

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.630
the same coordinates as mouse events. As well as a few

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.110
things from touch. It has a unique pointer

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.520
ID, similar to that touch ID we saw in

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.120
touch events. And, it also has a width and

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.220
a height of the touch point in touch cases.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.510
For pen cases it may have pressure or tilt.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.860
And, of course, the pionter event tells you what

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.350
type of pointer it is, whether it's a mouse

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.640
pointer or a touch pointer or a pen input.
