00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.780
So, we've got some, some first order logic. What does this really mean to

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.550
you as a developer. Say you have a spec, you could have written it,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.940
could have been given it, or whatever, and you want to implement it directly. So

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.290
we're going from, from spec directly to implementation,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.310
just one level of refinement. Property two says that you have an obligation to

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.170
make sure that each operation in the spec doesn't break anything.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.268
Any invariant. You can do this. You can insure yourself of this by testing,

00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:32.150
by code reviews or even by proving. But somehow you, you have to do it.
