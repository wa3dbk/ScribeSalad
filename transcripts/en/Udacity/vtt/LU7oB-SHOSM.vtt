00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I should say this is not an easy question. Any answer is positive.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If you look at whatever the data was, this is roughly how this line looks like,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and that means in the data, there is a tendency as you increase x

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
there would be an increase of y, so that means the correlation will be positive.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We can't tell what value it is. If the data fits exactly onto the line, then it would be one.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It could also be that the data has enormous deviation from this line,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and this is the best fitting line, in which case

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the correlation coefficient will be still larger than zero but it might be much closer to zero,

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
depending on the amount of deviation of those points from the line.
