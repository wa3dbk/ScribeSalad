00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.582
We're going to talk a little bit
about the Interactive Resume Project.

00:00:04.582 --> 00:00:07.054
You were told how to make the map here.

00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:12.079
Essentially, you had to add this line

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:18.841
to your resume.js file to
make the resume show up.

00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:24.403
And you also have to uncomment
a bunch of lines in your helper.js.

00:00:24.403 --> 00:00:30.160
So, essentially, all the lines here,
you have to uncomment those lines.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.760
And if you did this, the map on your
resume showed up via magic, or not.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.430
We're going to talk a little bit
about how this actually happens.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.060
What the code for
showing your resume is like.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.420
And essentially most of the code
is in the helper.js file,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.900
the file that you downloaded.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.879
And, there's one main function
that makes all of this happen,

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.767
it's called initializeMap.

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:05.251
And this function is essentially
called when your page loads,

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:12.607
initializeMap is called, essentially,
once you uncomment this quote over here.

00:01:12.607 --> 00:01:16.170
This is exactly what happens,
right let's close it.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.912
And in fact, I have actually
uncommented it in here so you can see,

00:01:20.912 --> 00:01:24.060
in here,
initializeMap is called on load.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.190
Yeah, this line over here, one of
the lines that you had to uncomment.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.520
Roughly, what happens when this
function is called is that, the script

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.270
collects all the locations from the
objects that you have in your resume.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.920
So this happens in a helper function
that's called locationFinder.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.610
Essentially, what this function does
is it looks over your work, and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.550
your places where you're working, and
your education, and your bio object.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.907
And it collects all the location
data from from those data objects,

00:01:57.907 --> 00:02:01.980
and then it uses a Google Play
search service to translate

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.720
those three addresses into longitude and
latitude and

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.470
then places that as pins on the map.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.030
So we can just go upwards
to this function.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.341
Because really, inside this function,
inside initializeMap,

00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:21.920
that's where everything happens.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.556
And so essentially we define several
helper functions inside this

00:02:26.556 --> 00:02:31.191
function and then call them in order
to collect the information and

00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:33.770
to present it as pins on the map.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.560
So the first interesting line that
we have here is this line over here.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.121
So, map = new google.maps.Map(document...).

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:48.197
And so, what happens is that in
here we create a new map object and

00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:51.493
we are passing two arguments
to fit this map.

00:02:51.493 --> 00:02:56.147
This argument over here,
the document.querySelector('#map'),

00:02:56.147 --> 00:03:00.976
that's just a division inside
your index.html file that the map

00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:06.400
should attach to that, that's
where the map should be displayed.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.850
And the map options is something
that we define over here.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.115
And it just tells Google Maps which
type of map we want to use and

00:03:15.115 --> 00:03:17.290
how we want to display it.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.780
And we can actually go to
see the documentation.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.870
So this is just in general
Google Maps web page,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.010
and then has a lot of information.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.880
And here you can see about
different map types that it has.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.090
And now there's an example.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.390
In here for example, there is an example
code of how to create a new map.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.384
So as you can see we're calling
new google.maps.Map and

00:03:51.384 --> 00:03:56.031
then attaching it to a certain
element in our index.html file, and

00:03:56.031 --> 00:03:58.250
then giving it the map options.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.590
All right, so, we're just
creating our new map here, but

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.350
we're not doing anything with it.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.750
Now first we need to collect all
the locations from our resume.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.930
And this happens in this function
over here, locationFinder.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.535
So what this does is, it's a really,
actually very simple function so

00:04:15.535 --> 00:04:18.916
there's nothing over here,
actually, that you haven't seen.

00:04:18.916 --> 00:04:21.663
Basically, we create an empty array and

00:04:21.663 --> 00:04:26.589
then we enter the locations from the
contacts in here as the first item and

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:30.860
we look over to education section and
the work section.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.578
And each location that we find we enter
it in and those locations are going to

00:04:35.578 --> 00:04:39.080
be, probably, street addresses or
some sort of a string.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.640
And we would essentially want to
translate those locations

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.450
into longitude and
latitude into the relevant objects so

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.340
that we can push them, so that we can
make them into pins into the map.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.550
And so this, as you can see over here.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.537
So at the end, we call locations
= locationFinder, right?

00:05:00.537 --> 00:05:07.500
So, this is all happening
inside initializeMap.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.280
So we create this new locations,
all right, it has all of our locations.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.850
And then we call pinPoster when
these locations are ready.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.650
So let's go and see what pinPoster does.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.962
So what pinPoster does,
it actually uses an additional service,

00:05:21.962 --> 00:05:24.580
the PlacesService,

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.940
which is not strictly a part of
Google Maps but it is a related service.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.378
It's a service that you
can use with Google Maps.

00:05:32.378 --> 00:05:36.360
And so essentially this is the service
that's going to translate those

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.290
locations into objects that
we can add into the map.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.717
The first step that we need to do,
to do that,

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:47.160
would be to create this service,
initiate this service.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.000
So this happens in this line over here.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.917
If we want to see how the information
on the Places Library, here it is.

00:05:55.917 --> 00:06:01.471
And so this essentially enables
the application to search for

00:06:01.471 --> 00:06:07.681
places and this is to make it work
in addition to what I've shown you.

00:06:07.681 --> 00:06:11.720
You have to add this line over
here in your index.html file.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.783
And in fact,
if you remember in the instructions,

00:06:14.783 --> 00:06:18.500
you were told to uncomment one
line in your index.html file.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.997
And this is the line that
you were told to uncomment.

00:06:20.997 --> 00:06:25.570
So essentially, this is the line
that loads this additional library.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.210
So as you can see, there are several
different types of searches that you can

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.530
perform using this library.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.620
You can do a nearby search, a text
search, and a bunch of other things.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.577
The search that we are using in
our helper.js, is a text search.

00:06:39.577 --> 00:06:44.482
So this is a search that essentially
presents a list of nearby places based

00:06:44.482 --> 00:06:45.930
on a string.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.552
And this is exactly what we needed
because in our resumeBuilder.js,

00:06:50.552 --> 00:06:55.726
we represented the different locations,
different schools, and different

00:06:55.726 --> 00:07:00.538
places that you work as string, so
this is the appropriate thing to use.

00:07:00.538 --> 00:07:07.802
And so here's a little more
information of what you need.

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:12.470
The different type of things
that you need to provide

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.910
in order to make your request work.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.302
But essentially,
the basic things that you need is,

00:07:19.302 --> 00:07:23.900
you need your request and
you need a callback function.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.647
So, basically to do a search,
you will run the service.textSearch, and

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:29.976
then you'll need to give
it your parameters.

00:07:29.976 --> 00:07:34.419
Requesting callback, the request
can contain a lot of things but

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:38.315
the basic thing that it has to contain,
would be a query.

00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:41.518
And the query item is just supposed
to be the string of the location that

00:07:41.518 --> 00:07:43.530
you're going to be searching for.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.680
So as you can see here, we have a for loop
will look up all our locations that we

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.145
collected before and make a new
request for each one of those.

00:07:51.145 --> 00:07:55.440
And with that locations string,
and then with this callback function.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.470
Now the callback function is essentially
the function is going to handle

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.930
whatever textSearch returns.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:09.009
So you need to put that function
as an input to textSearch.

00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:13.635
And so we have actually defined
this callback function over here.

00:08:13.635 --> 00:08:16.995
So this is a function that takes
two arguments, results and status.

00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:19.535
Both arguments are returned
by textSearch.

00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:21.755
Status just tells you whether
the service was able to return

00:08:21.755 --> 00:08:23.135
something meaningful.

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:28.435
And then what results
contains is an array of,

00:08:28.435 --> 00:08:30.135
essentially, longitude and latitudes.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.815
Why an array, because sometimes
there is more than one match.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.967
But we're going to use the first one.

00:08:35.967 --> 00:08:40.129
Essentially what this line over
here does is, it tests whether

00:08:40.129 --> 00:08:45.420
the status which was returned was OK,
whether we got a valid result.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.337
And if so, it calls another
function that we have defined here,

00:08:50.337 --> 00:08:55.280
createMapMarker, with
the first item of this array.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.050
And so essentially, createMapMarker
takes my location that was returned from

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:06.120
our textSearch and
it converts it into a pin on the map.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.685
So let's go look at createMarker.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.069
All right, so this is our
createMapMarker function and

00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:15.570
it takes this argument placeData.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.280
And so essentially, as you can sort of
guess how the placeData object looks

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.392
like, because we can access
the latitude and the longitude, and

00:09:24.392 --> 00:09:27.310
it also has a formatted address.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.931
So we can get all this
from our placeData, and

00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:35.800
then, what we do is we create
a new Google Maps marker.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.260
So the markers are something
that Google Maps provides.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:44.293
So we can go again and
look into our Markers section.

00:09:44.293 --> 00:09:47.646
So here we have a little bit
about markers, so essentially,

00:09:47.646 --> 00:09:49.042
very straightforward.

00:09:49.042 --> 00:09:51.560
A marker defines a location on the map.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.580
And there's a lot that you can
do in terms of changing how

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.460
the marker appears.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:01.000
So you can change the icon
that you're going to see.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.800
It has a default icon,
but you can change that.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.210
You can attach an info window to it
to display additional information,

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.200
and you were actually asked to do
this in one of the exercises in

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.030
the JavaScript Basics class.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.910
There's a lot you can do.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.495
But essentially, so
this is how you make a new marker,

00:10:19.495 --> 00:10:23.503
essentially call new google.maps.Marker.

00:10:23.503 --> 00:10:28.730
It has a position, it has the map
that it needs to attach to, and

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:34.670
the text that's going to be
part of the marker property.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:39.340
So, as you can see,
here we add this marker using our map.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.820
This is the location that
we're taking from placeData.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.578
And the title is just essentially
the formatted address that

00:10:48.578 --> 00:10:50.386
placeData returned.

00:10:50.386 --> 00:10:54.590
And as you can see over here, we
are also attaching an info window, we're

00:10:54.590 --> 00:11:00.570
creating a new info window and that is
going to open when you click a marker.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:05.310
We can see a little bit
about info windows as well.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.560
&gt;&gt; Yes, so let's take a step
back at [INAUDIBLE] because

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.220
there's been a lot of stuff
that we're talking about.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.740
So basically, what I'm asking,

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.080
when you were trying to figure
this out yourself, your process was you

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.250
were just stepping through each
function one at a time, right?

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.420
&gt;&gt; Right, yes.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.480
&gt;&gt; Right, so basically, if you think
about what Dimka did, guys, just if you

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.360
take a step back, she's already,
just through her experience, she's

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.190
already had a mental map, a strategy,
a framework of how to look things up.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.960
And that's actually one of the key
things that I like to point out,

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:45.290
that this is how you will develop
your strength as a developer.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.290
because most of the time,
most developers,

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.100
they don't know all of
the function calls.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.710
&gt;&gt; And sometimes you have to work with
pieces of code that you were given

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.960
on previous projects or
things that somebody worked on.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.440
And you're going to have to
figure out what they did.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.040
If they're nice,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.290
there are going to have some comments
that are going to be helpful.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.870
Sometimes, you're not
going to have comments or

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.750
you're going to have comments
that are less helpful.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.210
So you're going to have
to figure out stuff.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's the thing,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.010
this is a common strategy
that a lot of developers use.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.590
And I personally use this, too.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.880
Basically, I stepped into code,
as soon as I look at

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.590
things piece-wise, function-wise,
a couple of lines at a time,

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:40.370
and make sure that I'm stepping through,
I'm understanding the logic and

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:46.540
the flow of how this person did it.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.970
And then if I recognize a code that
I really want to dive deep into,

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.620
I need to then go in and do a search.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.921
I look at the API documentation and
usually if it's a popular library,

00:12:58.921 --> 00:13:04.147
such as Google and Google Maps,
there will be a ton of documentation.

00:13:04.147 --> 00:13:07.971
And there will be a ton of discussions
of people trying to figure out what

00:13:07.971 --> 00:13:11.680
does this documentation mean,
how do you do it, how does this work?

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.960
You can then do a lot of research and
piece together how things get done.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.719
&gt;&gt; And Google Maps, they have really
good documentation, in that they also

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:27.261
have examples of how to use things,
or how like to build these things.

00:13:27.261 --> 00:13:28.919
So it's really helpful, for example,

00:13:28.919 --> 00:13:32.060
if you're trying to build something
from Scratch, it's really helpful.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.270
And if you're just trying to figure
out why this piece of code works,

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:40.770
then you can look at the different
objects that are created that are used,

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.094
and read up on those.

00:13:42.094 --> 00:13:47.529
And see, okay, that's why they're
calling this with this as an argument

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:53.400
and that's why they have this as
a callback function, okay, now I got it.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:53.906
&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.

00:13:53.906 --> 00:13:56.851
So again, this is really not magic,

00:13:56.851 --> 00:14:01.652
it's just really knowing how
to approach things, right?

00:14:01.652 --> 00:14:03.368
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It's doing
a little bit of research.

00:14:03.368 --> 00:14:06.818
If it's something that's routine,
you've done this before,

00:14:06.818 --> 00:14:09.425
you've used this before,
then probably less.

00:14:09.425 --> 00:14:14.350
And if you just want to understand,
like a piece of code that

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:19.188
somebody gave you, that works,
and this happens a lot.

00:14:19.188 --> 00:14:23.016
Like for example, you're going to be
searching on say, stack overflow,

00:14:23.016 --> 00:14:26.905
how to do something, and you're going to
find this piece of code that somebody

00:14:26.905 --> 00:14:30.470
posted and said, hey if you want to
do this then use this piece of code.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.740
And you just copy and
paste it and it's going to work.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.720
But it's always a good idea to
kind of take the time to understand

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.620
why it works, as well.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.760
I mean obviously the goal was to make
it work, so now you made it work.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.090
But I think the greater goal would
be to understand why it works, so

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.010
that next time you can code it yourself.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:53.100
&gt;&gt; That's actually really good to know,
Alice, thank you.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.600
Info window.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and info window was something
that you were actually asked to

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.940
investigate a little bit
in one of the quizzes.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.140
&gt;&gt; Can you maximize your-
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:12.840
And so essentially, the way it works
with Windows is that you add a pop

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.180
up window to this marker that's going
to show up and can display more info.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:23.120
And then essentially, I'm actually going
to minimize this back so that I can show

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.980
you guys the documentation
on Info Windows, over here.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:33.426
Right, so you can see essentially what a
Info Window is, really space for text or

00:15:33.426 --> 00:15:38.570
for an image, and a pop up window about
the map that will give them location.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.518
So basically it just
like a little window.

00:15:42.518 --> 00:15:49.600
To add a window to open with
an info window you essentially need

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.940
to make a new one by calling new 
google.maps.InfoWindow and with contentString.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:16:00.390
And then you need to
attach it to your marker.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.200
So essentially,

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.138
over here we see how to attach it
to a marker using a click listener.

00:16:05.138 --> 00:16:10.015
So essentially, what this happens is,
that there's a listener that listens for

00:16:10.015 --> 00:16:14.170
whenever the marker is clicked,
this info window is opened.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.690
So this is essentially how
you add an info window.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:22.016
And this can also help you
with the solution to the quiz.

00:16:22.016 --> 00:16:25.884
&gt;&gt; That's great, thank you.
Thanks for showing us that walk through

00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:33.390
for just understanding how Google Maps
works in the interactive resume.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:39.092
We hope this will be useful for you,
because in, guess what, project five,

00:16:39.092 --> 00:16:43.681
you will have to implement your
own Google Maps from scratch.

00:16:43.681 --> 00:16:45.501
From at the very beginning.

00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:48.810
&gt;&gt; So you're going to have to be looking
at that documentation a lot more.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.518
&gt;&gt; So It's good to maybe thinking about
how things work behind the scenes.

00:16:54.518 --> 00:16:56.890
So it's going to help you
later on in your project five,

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.870
because then project five is
your neighborhood map project.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:06.612
And this is actually the project that
we do not give you any code for.

00:17:06.612 --> 00:17:07.401
&gt;&gt; You're on your own.

00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:08.625
&gt;&gt; You're on your own.

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:12.579
You're basically starting with
a blank page, a blank slate.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:17.010
So, for you people who are at this

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.858
stage on project two,
don't worry we'll build you up.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:23.200
So don't be scared.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.710
We're not trying to intimidate you or

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.200
anything, we just want to
let you know to paint

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.970
a nice picture of what's going to happen
and hopefully set good expectations.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.140
So you'll be led and
you won't get surprised.
