00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.170
The last thing is but, but, how do we know

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.820
it's the right instruction? Remember we need to make our prediction

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.439
while we're fetching the instruction. So if this is a

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.920
return instruction, we need to use the return address stack, before

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.198
we even determine that it is a return instruction. We

00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:19.846
cannot just keep pushing and popping things from the return address

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:23.477
stack, before we know it's a return. Because, for example,

00:00:23.477 --> 00:00:25.415
if there is an ad and we pop from the return

00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:28.880
address stack, then it's not going to work correctly. We actually need

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.509
to figure out, or at least very accurately predict, what's our

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.610
return instruction so that we can use the RATs appropriately. So

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.370
the problem is that we are using the RAT while fetching

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.280
the instruction. It's not been decoded yet, so we don't know

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.190
it's a return instruction yet. So how do we do it?

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.486
One way is to just use a very simple predictor that

00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:50.566
will be trained on whether the instruction we're fetching is the

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.606
right or not. Simply, trying to predict or one

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:56.270
way or the other depending on whether it's a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.862
rat or not and then make that predictor tell

00:00:58.862 --> 00:01:01.940
us whether to use a [UNKNOWN] or not. This

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.030
would be a very likely accurate predictor. If, at

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.810
the particular PC, we have seen a RET instruction

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.050
previously then it is very likely that if we

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.830
see the same PC we still have a return instruction.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.280
So we can use a single bit predictor

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.048
very easily here. Another approach, is to use

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:27.960
a so-called predecoding. We will soon see that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.540
the processor really contains a cache that stores

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.230
instructions that have been fetched from memory. And

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.500
its fetching instructions from the cache, and only

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.620
if the cache doesn't already contain the instruction

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.995
it goes from memory. So the predecoding works by,

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:44.760
when I'm fetching from memory, I decode

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.683
enough of the instruction to know that it's

00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:49.816
a return or not, and I store that

00:01:49.816 --> 00:01:53.371
information along with the actual instruction in the

00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:55.960
cache. So pretty much my memory will, for

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.510
example, have 32-bit instructions. In my cache I

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.270
will store 33 bits per instruction, 32 bits

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.030
of the actual instruction. And 1 bit that

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.258
tells me whether the instruction is a return or

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:12.400
not. So the idea is that as the instruction is

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.270
coming from memory, and we put it to cache.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.920
We can pre-decoding instructions, keeping some additional bits in the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.830
cache about the pre-decoding of the instruction. So that

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.600
when we fetch, we already know that information. The alternative

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.990
to this would have been to just fetch the

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.270
instructions from memory to cache as they are, and then

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.870
every time we fetch we have to figure out

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.960
what this instruction is. Because it's also more power-efficient

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.220
to do this once and then fetch instruction many

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.820
times rather than redo it every single time, pre-decoding

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.240
is a very popular approach. So pre-decoding is used

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.460
for things like, Is it a return instruction? Is

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.240
it a branch instruction at all? If we know

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.580
it's not a branch, than we can completely omit

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.330
the use of any branch vectors, thus saving a lot

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.270
of power. If our instructions are of variable sizes, predicoding

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.800
can also tell us, for example, how many bytes this

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.780
instruction is long so that we can fetch the next instruction

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.370
quickly and not. Rely on just the code in the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.780
instruction before we can fetch the next one, and so

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.880
on. So there is a lot of things that modern

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.660
processors do in this pre-decoding phase. In order to avoid doing

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.040
it when we are on the clock, after we have fetched the instruction.
