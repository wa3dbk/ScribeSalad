00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.905
To show how this algorithm works,

00:00:01.905 --> 00:00:05.765
let's assume that we have a list of nodes that are on the current frontier.

00:00:05.765 --> 00:00:09.210
What we want to find are all nodes that are 1 hop away from the frontier,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.508
so let's use this example here,

00:00:11.508 --> 00:00:14.364
and we're going to assume that we're 1 step into the breadth-first search,

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:16.851
so the frontier is nodes 1 and 3.

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:19.151
So now we're going to walk through the algorithm.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:23.478
Step 1, In parallel: For each node in the frontier, find the starting point of its neighbors.

00:00:23.478 --> 00:00:27.668
This is pretty simple; for vertex V, that's just R of V.

00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:30.534
In our example, node 1's neighbors start at offset 2,

00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:33.515
and node 3's neighbors start at offset 5.
