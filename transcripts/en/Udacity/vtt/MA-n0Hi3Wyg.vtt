00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.859
And if we reload the page, you can see

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.029
here that the bars have been converted into circles, and

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.730
the axes remain the same, in this case, years, with the label every four years.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.680
And the y axis represents attendance in millions.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.490
And with our scatter plot if we hover we still have the interactive features,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.760
but this time there's both a horizontal and a vertical guideline to animate out.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.348
My ideal choice of chart type in this case is a line plot.

00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:35.980
Since the x-axis represents time and

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.450
has a natural sequence to it, for any time series data a point at time

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.160
t on the x-axis somewhat depends on the time that just came before it.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.356
In this example, 1948 somewhat depends on 1947, which depends on 1946.

00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:56.414
And this natural ordering from one year to the next or

00:00:56.414 --> 00:01:01.240
from one data point to the next, represents something of a transition.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.350
And the line plot really evokes this interpretation by linking each data

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.610
point from one to the next with a graphical element.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.050
In this case a line or a path between the two.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.020
If we go back to our editor.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.040
Remember, we can change what type of plot we're making, or

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.040
chart, by simply changing what we pass to add series.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.970
In this case, let's change scatter to line, save our file, and

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.370
go back to our browser.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.980
If we refresh the page, we can see here.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.420
Every dot has disappeared and instead we have a line representing the trend.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.660
But one slight formatting quirk of this line plot is

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.370
that we no longer know how many data points we actually have.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.480
Especially if dimple didn't provide us with hover interaction.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.480
We wouldn't really know which years and

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.100
how much attendance in those years is represented in our data.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.680
And without the hover interaction it would actually be impossible to know

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.430
that a World Cup didn't happen in the year 1942, in the year 1946.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.419
Quick fix for this is to actually combine a line plot and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:13.440
a scatter plot to get the best of both charts and almost none of the down sides.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.870
And dimple again, being the flexible and powerful library that it is,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.960
to achieve this effect we simply just need to add another series.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.980
In this case, with a line and our scatter.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.700
And to draw them on the same set of x and y axes.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.320
Going back to the browser, now we have both the line showing the trend over

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.530
the years, and the circles to show us which years games actually happened in,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.160
and what the precise attendance was for those years.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.410
And with our scatter dots we can now see that there were no games

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.020
between 1938 and 1950, or rather, that the 1942 and 1946 games were skipped.
