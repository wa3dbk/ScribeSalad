Let's rewrite this just like we saw before. We can write it instead as 8 over 2

00:00:04.325 --> 00:00:10.310
times 10 to the 20 times 10 to the 8. This gives us 4, and here, we have 10 to

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.822
the 20 minus 8 or 10 to the 12th. So scientific notation gives us a great way

00:00:15.822 --> 00:00:20.820
to deal with very small and very large numbers. Numbers expressing the vastness

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.785
of the universe, numbers expressing tiny cells in the body. There're are even

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:28.669
smaller quantities around us, the building blocks of everything. A scientific

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.929
notation is also very useful for describing.
