00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:03.030
Next I'm going to go over some of the XP's values

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.870
and principles that I just hinted on earlier in the lesson.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.820
The first one, the first important value is communication. There

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.350
is no good project without good communication. And XP tries to

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.470
keep the right communication flowing and it uses several practices

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.890
to do that. It's got practices based on and require information

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.950
and in general share the information. For example, pair programming.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.140
And we're going to say more about that. User stories, customer involvement,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.240
all activities that help communication,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.440
that faster communication. Another important

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.420
principle that we already saw, is simplicity. And the motto here

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.680
is live for today without worrying too much about the

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.230
future. When you have to do something, look for the simplest

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.580
thing that works. And the emphasis here is on, that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.520
works. We want to build something simple, but not something stupid.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.090
Feedback. That's extremely important in XP, and it occurs at

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.560
different levels, and it is used to drive changes. For example,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.910
developers write test cases. And that's immediate feedback. If your test cases

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.140
fail, there's something wrong with the code. Or there's something that you

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.690
still haven't developed. Developers also estimate new stories right away as soon

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.060
as they get them from the customers and that's immediate feedback to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.515
the customer. And finally, on a slightly longer time frame, customers and

00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:07.820
tester develop together functional system test

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.600
cases to assess the overall system.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.100
And also in this case, that's a great way to provide feedback

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.850
and by the way, also to help communication. And finally, courage, the courage

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.860
to throw away code if it doesn't work. To change it if you

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.710
find a way to improve it. To fix it if you find a problem.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.300
To try out new things if you think that they might work better

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.410
than what you have right now. Now, that we can build and test systems

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.150
very quickly, we can be much braver than what we were before. So

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.790
how do we accomplish all that? And what are XP's practices that are going to

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.750
help us follow these principles and adhere to those values? These are some

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.900
of XP practices. There are more, but those are the ones that I'd like

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.240
to discuss in a little more depth, individually. Incremental planning,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.230
small releases, simple design, test first, refactoring. We will actually

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.680
have a whole lesson next on refactoring. Pair programming, continuous

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.240
integration, and on-site customer. So let's start with incremental planning.
