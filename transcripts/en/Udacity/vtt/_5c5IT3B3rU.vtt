[Narrator] The first 3 questions on this homework is so that you understand conditional probability.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For these 3 questions, we are going to use the relative frequencies of vowels in English,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and I'm giving you those results as a percentage of all the letters in a sample of typical English text.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You can assume that 13% of all letters in the text are the letter E,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
8% are A, 7% are O, 7% are I, and 3% are U.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Obviously, this is not a very audacious sample of English text.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
For question 1, assume some letter X is drawn randomly from English text

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
with the same distribution as we've collected here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Give the value of the probability that X is a vowel.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Your answer should be in the range from 0-1,

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so a real number where 0 means it could never occur, 1 means it always occurs.
