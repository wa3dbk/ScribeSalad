00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.890
We are now going to talk about the extract class refactoring. When a

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.040
softer system evolves, we might end up with classes that really do the

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.210
work of more than one class because we keep adding functionality to

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.010
the class. Therefore also they're too

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.160
big, too complicated. In particular, we might

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.250
end up with a class that is doing the work of two

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.890
classes. Typical examples are classes with many methods and quite a lot of

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.520
data, quite a lot of fields. In this case, it's normally good idea

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.120
to split the class into two, so what you will do, you will

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.700
create a new class and move there the relevant fields and methods from

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.700
the original class. So as to have two classes, each one implementing a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.900
piece of the functionality. Let's look at an example. In this case we're

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.850
going to use a UML like representation for the class. We have this class Person

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.769
that ends up representing also a phone number. And imagine that we add

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.500
up these pieces, you know, a little bit at the time so we end

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.430
up with something that really is doing the job of the person and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.490
of the phone number. So what we can do, we can actually do exactly

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.650
what we described here. We split this class

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.470
into a Person class, and the Phone Number class.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.440
And then we establish a use relation, so we

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.470
have a reference of the phone number class into

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.960
this class. And by separating the telephone number behavior

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.680
into its own class, I once more improved the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.980
structure of the code, because now I have classes

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.070
that are more cohesive, and do exactly one thing.
