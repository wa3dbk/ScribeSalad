00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.580
The next step in this password hashing adventure is to implement this function

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.320
called make password hash, make_pw_hash. Takes a

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.680
name and a password, and it returns

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.130
a hash of the name, password, and salt, concatenated, plus the salt. Separated

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.180
by a comma, I'd like you to use sha256 so, okay. Go ahead, good luck.
