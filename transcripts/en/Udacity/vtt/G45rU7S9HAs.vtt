00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.928
So this is a little demo that I typically do for the people that come here

00:00:04.928 --> 00:00:10.371
wondering what previs is all about. Normally, it begins with this kind of

00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:16.241
simple character that we build from various pieces and texture. We'll just take

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:20.797
that character and rig it up with our special rigging system, but have, we have

00:00:20.797 --> 00:00:24.951
it built in segments so that there's no actual skinning going on, so that we

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:32.555
can keep these guys running around very quickly. So then, we'll apply either an

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:37.703
animation cycle we've created or something that we do from the, from the motion

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:44.829
capture. And so of course, then, you can go and give this guy a friend. And

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.480
this is how we begin to build up the sequence. And then the director will start

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.565
to ask, okay, where are they standing, where is, what's the environment? So, we

00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:59.872
end up building this whole location to scale. So actually, when you go all the

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:03.902
way out, you see that this is topographically accurate, it's the real scale of

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:09.590
the real environment. So that, if the director wants to look in any different

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.510
direction, they're seeing the correct heights of all of the landmarks. Then,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.030
I'll just add a few effects to this particular shot, required some

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.280
pyrotechnics. So, we actually ended up going and consulting with the

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.194
pyrotechnics guys to make sure that the, the scale of the, of the explosions

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:35.416
was correct. So even though, they're just a bunch of still images, we end up

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:41.146
getting the accurate scale of what these, the explosions would be. But, the

00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:44.684
first thing that I need to do before it becomes a shot is actually look at it

00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:50.394
through a camera. So here, the guys running through the shot, this is how we

00:01:50.394 --> 00:01:59.220
initially composed the scene. And then we decided, you know what, let's do an

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.911
alternate angle. So, we just quickly threw in another, another view. And this

00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:10.627
is the same action, but played out as just a pan tilt as opposed to a dolly

00:02:10.627 --> 00:02:15.300
shot. So you can get a lot of, create different camera moves out of the same

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.635
action. Next up I want to show you how we add some extra realism to the camera

00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:27.020
itself. First of all, we select the camera, and then we have all kinds of

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.499
controls. in this case, I'm going to turn on the handheld control. And I can

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.854
amp this up, so that now, instantly, I see the same action but with a bit more

00:02:36.854 --> 00:02:42.810
shake on it, so it feels more realistic. Especially great for these kinds of

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.463
action sequences. Once the scenes are approved, we end up taking a look at this

00:02:47.463 --> 00:02:53.750
from a completely different perspective. Can we actually do this shot? And in

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.370
the case of this particular shot, they decided, well, let's just start shooting

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.301
this on a green screen. And so, how this actually works is, we can take a look

00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:11.006
in my at the volume of the sound stage. And we brought in of course, all of the

00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:17.413
gear, the, the lights, the, the camera equipment. So, when we're looking at the

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:22.110
shot on set we can make sure that we have the right-sized green screen, and

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.260
that all of the technical pieces are working. Now you'll notice here in the

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.290
beginning that one of the actors is stepping on this kind of red dolly track

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.650
that we have there. So, what we need to do is make sure that kind of move this

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.056
over and we can, we can place that wherever we need it to be. And our camera

00:03:47.056 --> 00:03:53.008
rigs work in reverse. So right now, this is giving me a certain solution. It's

00:03:53.008 --> 00:04:00.138
all driven by the creative camera, but the actual rig just follows along. So if

00:04:00.138 --> 00:04:04.493
I wanted to take this rig, and in my change the trajectory of the rig, I could

00:04:04.493 --> 00:04:11.332
scoot it over this way so it's out of the shot. The, creatively, the shot is

00:04:11.332 --> 00:04:15.493
going to be the same, but, at least we know now where best to put all of the

00:04:15.493 --> 00:04:20.774
gear. So, the last part of the story here is, once we've got the creative

00:04:20.774 --> 00:04:24.556
worked out, we've got a plan for how to shoot it effectively, then we need to

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:31.636
make sure that we communicate that to the clients. So we give them all these

00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:37.360
different views and usually encapsulated into one particular drawing. a page

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.715
that we can give to the production managers or the producers, so that they can

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:48.010
keep track of how each of these shots was created digitally. But it's not to

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.640
take anything away from what the real cinematographers would do when they step

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.695
on onto the set. But at least, that they've brought the right camera crane, the

00:04:56.695 --> 00:05:00.325
all of the gear that they need to make sure that they effectively have all the

00:05:00.325 --> 00:05:03.430
tools to produce the shot.
