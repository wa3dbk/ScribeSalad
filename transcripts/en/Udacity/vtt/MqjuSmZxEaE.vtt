00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.320
All right, so let's start sort of
climbing up the visual system,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.920
starting at the bottom,
which of course is the eye.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.130
And here is a sort of
a schematic picture of the eye.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.162
And you know, lights coming in this way,
and there are a variety of structures.

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:17.730
Let's see, a couple that we'll,
we will mention.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.670
So you have this lens here.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.890
Lens changes, what's in focus.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.430
And by the way, you have what might
be thought of a spherical retina.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.970
And so, the, in some sense,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.759
spherical retinas are a lot easier
to deal with planar retinas.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.270
We make, we put planar retinas
in cameras, things like that,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.740
spherical means all the rays are sort
of the same, which is kind of nice.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.870
The other thing to notice
on these lenses is,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.200
that they're attached by
these fibers right here.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.750
And those fibers pull on the lens,
and they cause the lens to,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.380
to deform, which changes the focus,
and that's how you focus near and far.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.460
Well that's how you focus near and far.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.610
The way I focus near and
far is I put on reading classes.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.460
Why is that?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.720
Because I'm old.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.500
Well, I'm not that old, but what
happens is my eyeballs think I'm old.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.470
In fact, sometime, right around my
40th birthday, I looked at my watch,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.695
and I was trying to wonder how my watch
knew it was my 40th birthday because it

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.355
decided to go out of focus,
just that day.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:15.685
But what happens is,
the ability of your,

00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:19.565
of those fibers to deform that lens,
that lens, it hardens up a bit.

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:22.025
And, and you lose the ability
to deform the lens as much and

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:23.135
you can't do near focus.

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:26.815
And that's why you see
those of us with less hair

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:29.110
carrying around reading glasses.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.250
So, the lens focuses
the light coming in,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.290
goes through this center
called the pupil.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.270
You have a certain amount of
adjustment of the size of the pupil to,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.710
in terms of the amount of
light that's in there.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.000
We'll, we'll talk about
the dynamic range in a minute.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.500
And then what happens is
the light passes through a,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.820
a clear liquid,
which keeps the eye in its shape, and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.280
it projects onto this back
area called the retina.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.170
Okay.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.280
And, one of the things you'll also
notice in here is that there's this

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.640
optic nerve, there's also a bunch
of blood vessels that come in and

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.410
feed the retina.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.910
And we'll talk, in a little bit,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.880
about how come it is that it comes
all the way up through here, so

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.630
that it actually sees the, the middle
here that is, it's not just in the back.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.210
But when you look in there, what you
would see is a funny little area.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.990
It's, referred to as the optic disc or
the blind spot.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.600
And in fact, if you've ever
been to an ophthalmologist and

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.820
he looks in your eye,
what he sees is something like this.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.320
All right?

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.730
That's assuming everything's healthy.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.300
So there are all these blood vessels
that are nurturing the, the retina, and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.930
then there's this area in the middle
where the blood vessels and, and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.320
nerves are coming together and
that's your blind spot.
