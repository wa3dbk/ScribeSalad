00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.400
At this point, you might have some questions.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.400
You might be wondering if GitPull is the same as fetching and then merging.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.610
Why haven't our previous pulls generated merge commits like this one did?

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.040
It's a fair question.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.220
The answer is fast-forward merges.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.900
This kind of merge occurs when you merge two commits,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.130
where one is ancestor of the other.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.330
That is, where one commit is reachable by the other.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.730
If all merges happened the way we've been showing you so

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.720
far, if you took b and tried to merge it into a, then you would end up

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.190
with a merge commit that had both commits as a parent, and you would move a.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.260
In the usual case, merge commits are generated to keep track of

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.210
all the commits that played a part in getting to this new stage.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.070
But in this case, the commits that played those parts are this one and this one.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.540
And this commit already has all the information about this one's history.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.150
So there's not actual reason to add this extra one.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.330
So instead of adding a new commit,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.610
all we would do is update the label to point here instead.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.180
Hopefully, at this point the name fast-forward merge makes sense.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.900
We're taking a label from the history of a branch somewhere in its ancestry, and

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.830
moving that label forward to the tip of the branch.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.280
Take a look at these commit histories.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.120
Check the box next to each diagram,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.970
where merging Branch B into Branch A would result in a fast-forward merge.
