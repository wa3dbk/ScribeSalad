00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.160
So let's look at what one memory bit
looks like in SRAM and DRAM technology.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.480
The bit sits at the intersection of
a wordline that passes by many bits,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.219
and the bitline that
also passes by many bits.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.540
So memory is a matrix
of cells like this.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.510
And DRAM will also have a wordline and
a bitline.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.120
What the wordline does, is it controls
a transistor here that can open or

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.180
close itself to connect
the cell to the bitline.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.492
So the idea is that,
if we want to access this cell,

00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:39.422
we activate this wordline which
opens this transistor, and

00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:42.800
now the memory cell is
connected to the bitline.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.200
So if we want to write data, we put
the bitline at the value we want, and

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.090
the cell gets that value.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.770
If we want to read the data,
we'll let go of the bitlines, and then

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.770
the cell here will get a new value on
the bitline, so we can sense what it is.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.570
In SRAM, the actual memory cell
consists of two inverters.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.460
Each inverter has two transistors,
that's how you build an inverter.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.850
And the idea is that, if this is 1 here,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.440
then this inverter flips it and
outputs a 0 here.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.840
This other inverter flips that and
outputs 1 here, so

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.935
once we disconnect this transistor,
this cell will keep its value.

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:27.820
It's going to maintain a 0 here
because that 0 is inverted and

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.750
output is a 1 here,
which amplifies the 0 here, so

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.000
we have a feedback loop here that
keeps the data that we want.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.950
So how to we write to this cell?

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.860
So if we try to put a 1 here, this
inverter here is working against us.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.880
Because it sees a one,
it wants to output a zero.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.830
And the answer to that,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.311
is that this transistor here
connects this cell to the bit line.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.100
If we put a stronger 1 here,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.850
because these are small inverters,
we can defeat them, so

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.030
that even though this inverter is trying
to put a 0 here, we defeat it with a 1.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.783
And then what happens is,
that now that this is a 1,

00:02:07.783 --> 00:02:10.780
this inverter outputs a 0 here,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.330
this inverter now starts outputting
a one, and the cell becomes a 1.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.280
To make that easier, typically we
have two of these transistors and

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.110
two bit lines for the same cell
that have the opposite values.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.480
So for this cell to become a 1,
we put 1 here and 0 here.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.900
That puts a 1 here at the same
time when we are putting a 0 here.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.600
So these are more easily defeated.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.590
When we want to read, we can connect
both of them to the bit lines.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.710
And if we wrote a 1 here, we will
have this one be 1, this one be 0.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.350
So this line really
outputs the bit we want.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.460
And this one just outputs the opposite
value of the bit we want.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.160
By looking at the difference
between these bitlines,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.420
we can more quickly detect
what the cell actually has.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.040
As we said,
these are weak transistors here.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.140
So once we connect this cell to
the bitlines, the bitline is long.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.890
And in order to, for example,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.050
raise the voltage on the bitline
to a value that corresponds to 1,

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.510
this transistor here are weak and
cannot pull it to 1 very fast.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.550
They also will try to
lower this one down to 0,

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.700
and they may not be able
to do that very fast.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.390
So at the other end here where we're
trying to detect what's in this cell,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.500
instead of looking at when will this
cross a threshold between a 0 and a 1,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.140
what we look at is in what direction
is the difference of these two going.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.540
We make them, initially,
about halfway between 0 and 1.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.070
We then activate the word line,
the cell now starts,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.340
let's say, pulling this one up and
lowering this one down.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.390
If we look at what's
the difference very quickly,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.690
we'll detect that this one here,
because it's drawn towards 1,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.420
is getting to be larger voltage
than the voltage on this one.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.850
So we can now say that the cell had a 1
before it actually manages to pull this

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.035
fully to 1 and lower this fully to 0.
