00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.357
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know that if we want to write this in the form x plus a times x plus b,

00:00:04.357 --> 00:00:09.176
that in this case, a times b will equal negative 150, and a plus b will equal

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:13.900
25. Since a times b is negative, either a or b needs to be negative and the

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.892
other needs to be positive. So what are some things that multiply it to equal

00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:24.994
negative 150? Well, there's negative 1 times 150. There's negative 3 times 50.

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:31.084
There's negative 5 times 30. Oh, it looks like that one will work since, as we

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:37.192
know, 25 is equal to 30 minus 5. So the equation now should read x plus 30 times

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:38.634
x minus 5 equals 0.
