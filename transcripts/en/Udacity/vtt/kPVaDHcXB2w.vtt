00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.859
The most important thing
you have to remember,

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:05.180
is that every time you transfer data,
no matter how small,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.530
the radio could stay powered up
for nearly half a minute.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.490
So every decision you make,
should be based

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.360
on minimizing the number of times
that this happens.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.329
But of course there's a balance here.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.340
You want to download all the data
a user is likely to need

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.420
for the current section,
in a single burst,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.200
over a single connection
at full capacity.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.783
But of course, you don't just want
to pull down everything

00:00:26.783 --> 00:00:28.886
wasting battery power and bandwidth

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:31.160
downloading data that's
never going to be used.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.200
Now I could go on for hours on this topic, 
but Dan's getting impatient,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.260
and you can learn the details
on how to implement

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.433
each of these best practices, 
including pre-fetching,

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:41.946
batching, and bundling,
burying you rupdate frequency,

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:43.750
and minimizing your payloads,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.670
by watching the series
of Dev Lite videos

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.360
or reading the developer guides
linked to in the instructor notes below.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.790
Now before I leave it to Dan
to show you how to implement

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.370
a sync adapter for Sunshine
that takes advantage

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.860
of a lot of the best practices
I just described,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.940
let's consider what the
best practice would be

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.130
if you were building something
like a news reader app.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.790
How much data should you download 
when the app is first started?

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.670
Just the front page of headlines?

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.770
All the stories and images
linked to from that front page?

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.110
Every story available, 
but none of the images?

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.260
Or every story and every image
currently available?
