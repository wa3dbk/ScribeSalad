Okay, so, for more efficient partitioning, that is actually not true.

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:07.050
We have not been touching the partition function, the partition function does not have

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.685
anything to do with the dynamic launches that I can do the recursive parallelism.

00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:13.183
Launching on the fly, however, yes.

00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:20.323
That does substantially contribute because I don't have to keep returning back to the CPU to do my launch forming.

00:00:20.323 --> 00:00:23.494
That means I'm communicating less data and it means that my

00:00:23.494 --> 00:00:25.862
launch occurs immediately when I need it,

00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:29.599
instead of waiting around until that particular wave of launched is finished.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.675
Simple code, while convenient and I can probably maintain it faster,

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:36.506
is not the reason why it actually runs any faster.

00:00:36.506 --> 00:00:42.412
And finally, greater GPU utilization is probably the cause for the greatest of speedups.

00:00:42.412 --> 00:00:48.551
By launching on the fly, I'm making sure my GPU is always busy, so when one partial sort finishes,

00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:54.090
it creates 2 more immediately, keeping my GPU fully stacked up and busy with work.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.628
It streams more work for my GPU at one time, and my sort ends up faster end-to-end.

00:00:58.628 --> 00:01:04.634
In fact, when I've written this program in dynamic parallel form and then host launched form,

00:01:04.634 --> 00:01:08.634
I see a pretty much exactly factor of 2 speed up between the two.
