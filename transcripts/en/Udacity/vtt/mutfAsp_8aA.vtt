00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What you'll notice here is that I gave you a quiz

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
before telling you how to actually determine whether

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the timing of inputs is important for a particular software under test,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and that was deliberate because I wanted to get you to think about the issues

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but also because there aren't really any great hard and fast answers here,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so let's talk about this a little bit more.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Basically what you want to do to figure out if timing matters for the inputs

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
for the software under test is think about its specification.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Think about what it's trying to do. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Think about its requirements, and also look at the source code for the software,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and you want to look for things like timeouts, things like timed sleeps,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and basically values or computations 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that depend on the time at which things happen.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If you see any of that, then it's strongly possible

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that you're going to need to take time into account while testing the software,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and that means, for example, delivering some inputs to the software under test very quickly,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
delivering other inputs rapidly, and seeing how the software responds.
