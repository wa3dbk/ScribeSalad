00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Narrator] We can also learn a lot about the internet by measuring our latency to different destinations,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and in fact we can also see the hops along the way.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I showed you on the map of Greece the hops along the way.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We can see the same thing for destinations on the internet,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and we can do that using an application called traceroute.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If you're using a Mac you can just create a shell and run traceroute directly.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If you're using some other operating system you might need to do something a little different,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and we'll have directions for that on the site,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but you can do traceroute and after traceroute you pick

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
where you want the destination to be.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
First we'll try tracing the route to Udacity.com,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and what traceroute is doing is sending packets over the internet,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
looking at all the intermediate hops to figure out the route it takes

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to get a packet from where I am now to the Udacity.com site,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and when we run that we see the route.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You can see each hop, so from where I am now

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to reach Udacity.com took 15 steps.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The total time was about 39 milliseconds.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You can see there are several different times in doing multiple tests

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and the time might vary each test, but the time is about 39 milliseconds,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and you can also see the steps.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The first thing you see is that our site is actually being served on a server run by Google.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That's what the Udacity.com site resolves to,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and you can see all the hops along the way.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The 192.168.1.1 that's a special internet address that means your local machine,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
you always start there, and then you can see all the other hops that we go through,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and the time it took to get there.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
There are different hops that took different amounts of time.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You can see the time does vary.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We can see that the time to get to the Comcast site here in Santa Clara

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
varied from 11 to 37 milliseconds and you can see all the other hops along the way.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
That each hop took a millisecond or 2 between that hop.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
To get 15 hops took us about 40 milliseconds.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If we try to go somewhere further away, let's try tracing the route to MIT.edu.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Well that server is running from Boston.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm here in California.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
To get to Udacity.com we didn't have to go very far geographically.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
To get to MIT we've got to go across the country, now we're going to Boston.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We started where we are now, we went through Santa Clara, went through San Jose.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Sometimes from the host names you can guess where they are, sometimes you can't,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but here it's pretty clear we're going from San Jose, and then we're going across the country to New York,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and you can see that the big time difference was when we went from San Jose to New York.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
There's no hops, so unlike the Greeks where the distance between hops was very limited,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
in the internet the distance between hops can be thousands of miles.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
There's some fiber optic cable probably between those 2 points, and there's no need for any routing directions.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Once you got to this point in San Jose you end up in New York without going through any other decision points,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and then we get to Boston, and it takes about 100 milliseconds before we get to MIT,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and you can see we're not actually getting the final destination.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We're getting some stars; we're not getting a response from the web server at MIT.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
We could do that if we tried a few more traceroutes and set the time outs differently,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
but to get across the country it took about 100 milliseconds,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and we can go somewhere further away.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
About the furthest away you can get from where I am now is Madagascar.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I'm going to try tracing a route to a server in Madagascar.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
If there are any students in Madagascar please contact me,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and we try that traceroute, and we can see that it starts again

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
going through San Jose, goes through Dallas,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and now it's going through a lot of servers run by the same country,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and that's getting across the ocean, getting towards Madagascar,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and you can see it's starting to take quite a long time.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It took 100 milliseconds to get to MIT.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Here we have taking 195 milliseconds already, and

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
we haven't yet reached Madagascar.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The time it takes to do the traceroute is much longer than the time it takes

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
to get a request from these pages because it's sending many requests

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
trying to find all the points along the way, but this is a good way

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
you can see what's going on in the internet and get a better understanding

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
of how packets are getting from where you are to where you're making a request.
