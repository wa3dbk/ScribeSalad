00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.839
Here's our 3rd practice problem for the Pythagorean Theorem. I want you to try

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:08.365
to find the side lengths of a triangle whose hypotenuse is 4x and who's legs

00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:13.620
are 3x plus 1 and 2x plus 2. When you think you've found the numbers for each

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.090
of them, enter them here.
