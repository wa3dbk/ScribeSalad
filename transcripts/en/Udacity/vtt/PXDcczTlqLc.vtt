00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.166
Since our t statistic is past this critical value, out here in the critical

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:09.856
region, we'll reject the null. This means that participants made significantly

00:00:09.856 --> 00:00:15.230
fewer errors, using the QWERTY keyboard compared to the alphabetical keyboard.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.820
Since this was an experimental design, we can make causal statements. So we can

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.463
say that they type of keyboard had a causal effect on the number of errors.
