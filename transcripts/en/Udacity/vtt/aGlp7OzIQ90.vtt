00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.320
In this problem you need to divide your work up into chunks; in this case, tiles.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.013
We have a continuum between tiny tiles--lots of them,

00:00:08.013 --> 00:00:13.784
and fewer tiles where each tile is sized to the maximum that can fit in a single thread block.

00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:15.123
And in this particular problem,

00:00:15.123 --> 00:00:18.019
bigger tiles means less memory bandwidth; this is good.

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.397
Generally then you want to make your tiles as big as can fit into a single thread block,

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.970
because that minimizes overall memory bandwidth.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.929
But note the following 2 caveats.

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.264
One, you need to have at least as many thread blocks

00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:31.266
as you have SMs in your GPU,

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.437
because otherwise you'll have SMs sitting idle.

00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:36.319
Definitely you want to make sure fill the machine

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:38.387
with enough work to keep all the SMs busy,

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:41.368
even if you have to move a little bit this way on the continuum

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:43.982
and size your tiles just a little bit smaller.

00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:46.720
Two, if you're sitting at the right end of this continuum,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.592
it's best for overall memory bandwidth,

00:00:48.592 --> 00:00:50.798
but often it turns out that you would actually prefer

00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:52.969
to just maybe 1 tick to the left.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.897
This allows a small number,

00:00:54.897 --> 00:00:57.670
say, 2 blocks to both B-resident at a time,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.595
And that potentially gives better latency-hiding characteristics,

00:01:00.595 --> 00:01:03.164
because you have more warps that may be in flight at the same time

00:01:03.164 --> 00:01:05.677
from slightly different pieces of the program.

00:01:05.677 --> 00:01:08.642
It's certainly something that you would want to tune carefully

00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:12.249
if you needed the fastest possible implementation.
