00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.968
We have a problem with transforming normals when using non-uniform scaling

00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:08.520
matrices. If we tried to transform the normal with the same scaling matrix used

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.860
to transform the vertex coordinates, we ran into the strange situation of

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.300
normals getting bent away from their surfaces. How to solve this? I'll jump to

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.396
the punch line. What you want to use to transform normals is the transpose of

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:27.317
the inverse of the model matrix. You could also use the inverse of the transpose

00:00:27.317 --> 00:00:31.232
of the model matrix. They're the same thing. Either way that's a mouthful and

00:00:31.232 --> 00:00:34.626
let me explain. Let's look at how this solution applies to each different kind

00:00:34.626 --> 00:00:38.392
of transform that we're used to. First of all, forget about translation

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:42.680
matrices. We're going to be transforming normals and translation matrices do not

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.750
affect vectors in any way. For rotation matrices, the transpose is the inverse.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.590
The transpose of the inverse, in other words, would be the inverse of the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.220
inverse. This is starting to sound a little like Alice in Wonderland. To be a

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.180
little more clear, if you take the transpose of the inverse of a rotation

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.928
matrix, you get the same rotation matrix back. This means that for matrix made

00:01:05.928 --> 00:01:10.600
up of any series of translations and rotations you can use this same matrix to

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.085
transform points and normals. This is because the transpose is the inverse as

00:01:15.085 --> 00:01:19.442
far as normals are concerned. Scaling makes it no longer true that the transpose

00:01:19.442 --> 00:01:23.880
is the inverse so, we have to take special steps. If the scaling matrix is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.392
uniform. In other words the shape of the object doesn't change. We can get away

00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:31.976
with just normalizing the normals after transforming by the original model

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:36.095
matrix. For non-uniform scaling where the shape of the object does change we

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:40.515
must explicitly compute this special transpose of the inverse matrix in order to

00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:45.176
transform normals correctly. Or you can do the inverse of the transpose. I'm not

00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:49.338
going to explain here why the transpose of the inverse works. You likely don't

00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:53.114
want me to talk about contravariant and covariant vectors. See the additional

00:01:53.114 --> 00:01:57.655
course materials for more information. If you keep away from non-uniform scaling

00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:01.620
matrices, you'll never run into this mismatch and can merely use the modeling

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.554
matrix for both position and vector transforms. If you never use scales of any

00:02:05.554 --> 00:02:09.463
sort you won't even have to re-normalize your vectors. The good news is that if

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:13.349
you use scales of any sort in three.js it will correctly handle normal

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.405
transformation for you. It's only when you're using scales on your own that you

00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:21.045
can get pretty weird shading results if you don't pay attention. And you do want

00:02:21.045 --> 00:02:25.628
to pay attention. As while this is always the correct answer, it's costly to

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:30.110
compute all the time. I've seen many a young programmer led astray by normal

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.719
transformation. Seriously, back in the 1980s before any book ever mentioned it.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.990
This problem was fairly common. Back then, we consulted for a hardware company,

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.086
who will rename nameless, writing programs using their expensive graphics

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:49.352
accelerator. And I mean expensive, something like $35,000, the price of a nice

00:02:49.352 --> 00:02:52.920
BMW back then. I found that the graphics accelerator had this problem with

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.422
polygon display. Meaning we had to avoid using non-uniform scales as a modeling

00:02:57.422 --> 00:03:01.892
operation. The company was more than a bit dismayed when they found out about

00:03:01.892 --> 00:03:04.483
this problem, since it's costly to fix properly.
