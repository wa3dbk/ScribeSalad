00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.770
Let's talk about how to infer denial

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.380
of service activity using a technique called backscatter.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.890
The idea behind backscatter is that when

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.400
an attacker spoofs a source IP address, say

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.530
on a TCP SYN flood attack, that the replies to that initial TCP SYN from the

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.930
victim will go to the location of the source IP address. This replies to

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.750
forged attack messages are called" backscatter". Now

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.500
the interesting thing about backscatter is that if

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.140
we can assume that the source IP addresses

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.540
are selected by the attacker at random, and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.660
we could set up a portion of the network where we could monitor this back

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.600
scatter traffic, coming back as SYN-ACK replies to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.500
forged source IP addresses. If we assume that

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.550
these source IP addresses are picked uniformly at random, then the amount of

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.560
traffic that we see as back scatter. Represents exactly a fraction that's

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.300
proportional to the size of the overall attack. So for example, if we monitor N

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.650
IP addresses and we see M attack packets, then we expect

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.590
to see here N over two to the 32 of the total

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.770
back scatter packets and hence of the total attack rate. If we want to compute

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.770
the total attack rate, we simply invert this fraction. So for

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.890
example, in this case, if our telescope were a slash eight, or two

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.130
to the 24th IP addresses, we would simply multiply our observed

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.950
attack rate x by two to the 32 divided

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.523
by two to the 24 or 255.
