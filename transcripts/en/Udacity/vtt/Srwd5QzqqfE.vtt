I think with pseudocode you always need examples. Here's some pseudocode. We'll

00:00:05.127 --> 00:00:15.442
have two items with prices 1 and 10 and we'll set the cost initially to 0. Tax

00:00:15.442 --> 00:00:23.731
is the item price times 0.08. The tip is the item price times 0.18. And I'll

00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:29.160
set the cost to whatever it was before plus the item price, the tax, and the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.489
tip. And print the cost. What should this print? And when might you use this

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.174
process?
