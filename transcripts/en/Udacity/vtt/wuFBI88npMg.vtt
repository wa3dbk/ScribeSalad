Next, Greg, Susan and I are going to talk about dramatic emotional personality

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:09.923
disorders. These include histrionic, borderline, anti-social, and narcissistic

00:00:09.923 --> 00:00:15.588
personality disorders. So to start, people with histrionic personality disorder

00:00:15.588 --> 00:00:22.336
act in very dramatic, seductive, flamboyant and exaggerated ways. They can also

00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:27.651
be very emotional, intense, self-centered and shallow. So as you can imagine it

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:30.738
can be very difficult to have a relationship with somebody with histrionic

00:00:30.738 --> 00:00:35.490
personality disorder because of how self-centered and shallow they really are.
