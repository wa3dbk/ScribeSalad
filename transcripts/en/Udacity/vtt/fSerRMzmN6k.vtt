00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.210
Now let's look at the different
types of viruses.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.860
The first is a parasitic virus.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.220
They typically scan
programs on a system, for

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.140
example on the hard drive, and
then infect these programs.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.980
The second is the memory-resident virus.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.780
They're typically of an operating
system, and when the system runs,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.770
the opening system is
loaded into the memory.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.520
So as long as a system is running,
the virus, resize the memory.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.020
Then it can infect any running
program on the system.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.110
The third is the macro virus.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.100
They're typically
embedded in a document.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.720
And when a document is opened,
the virus also runs and spreads.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.180
The fourth, is the Boot sector virus.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.240
They reside in the boot
sector of a hard drive, and

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.630
whenever a system is booted the Boot
sector virus will run and spread.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.660
A very important type of virus
is called a Polymorphic virus.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.423
For a Polymorphic virus,
each instance, or each infection,

00:00:55.423 --> 00:01:00.109
can look different because part of the
virus program is encrypted by a randomly

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.870
generated key at each infection.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.710
The purpose of using polymorphic
virus is to avoid detection by

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.120
easy signature matching.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.310
We will discuss this a little bit later.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.270
We should note that any of these
type of viruses can by polymorphic.
