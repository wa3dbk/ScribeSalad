Let's say you spent 12 hours awake today. That means out of 24 hours, you spent

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:11.891
12 hours asleep. And let's say you spent 24 awake. That means you spent 0 hours

00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:16.160
asleep. if we graph this for everyone, all of you will fall somewhere along

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.840
this line. We're assuming that you can't be half-awake or half-asleep. And in

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.365
that case, r is negative one. But normally, we deal with data that is not

00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:31.625
perfectly correlated. And we can't calculate it in our heads. Instead, we'll

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:35.700
use software, and we can do it with Google Spreadsheets. Yay!
