00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.734
So if Miriam really does have a friendly personality. What we mean by that is

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:09.818
that her threshold for acting friendly is lower than most people. So here we

00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:15.744
see Miriam's threshold for acting friendly. She's more likely to act friendly

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:21.455
in different situations as compared to not acting friendly. On the other hand,

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:25.231
we have Biriam, who has a very high threshold for acting friendly, meaning it

00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:28.830
takes him a lot more to be nice to someone than it would for Miriam to be nice

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:37.554
to someone. So this is one trait that makes Biriam and Miriam unique. So traits

00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:43.175
change our threshold for behaving. And make us more likely to behave in ways

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:48.585
consistent with with the trait. Such as being friendly. And less likely to

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:54.170
behave in ways Inconsistent with the trait, for example, being hostile or mean.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.265
So just because it takes a lot more for Biriam to be friendly, it doesn't mean

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:02.490
that he can't be friendly and just because Miriam is usually friendly doesn't

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:09.138
mean there aren't situations where she's not friendly. Their traits make them

00:01:09.138 --> 00:01:12.435
more likely to behave in a way that's consistent.
