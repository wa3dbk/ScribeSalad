00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here we are in the file we've been working in this entire lecture.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This has our class link.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That just has the basic properties,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then 25 instances of that class that we've been scanning and searching over.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What I'd like you to do--this doesn't involve any SQL--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is implement this function link by ID.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That takes a link ID and will return

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the link object itself.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So for example, if I gave it 24,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
it would return this entire link object.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Use the global variable links to find this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Okay, good luck.
