00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.550
Okay, JP,
I've been procrastinating long enough.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.490
I need to do something about privacy and
chopping the sharing.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.460
Right now,
when you click on the my list screen,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.930
you see every single shopping list.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.180
And while it does show you who
owns each list, it still shows you

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.580
all of the lists that were created
even from strangers that you frankly,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.030
don't care about.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.740
Instead of this being a free for all.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.730
I think the best idea would be to
implement some sort of sharing.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.190
Here, let me show you what I've got.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.330
My plan is that when you make a list,
only you can see and access that list.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.165
So if I have my generic grocery
list here and I just made it.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.675
Only I can actually see this.

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:36.285
But what I'll do is,
I'll add a little share button up here.

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:38.325
Clicking share opens up
a list of your friends.

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:40.905
Out of the hundreds or
thousands of users, or hopefully,

00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:43.860
hundreds of thousands of users,
that they'll someday be.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.380
You probably have a smaller circle
of friends that you actually want to

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.560
share shopping lists with.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.980
So we'll store the data of who
you say that you often share

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.000
shopping lists with.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.910
And then you could add additional
friends by clicking this

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.560
button down here.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.470
And this will take you to
the add friend activity.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.560
And this activity here would have
a list of all users of the app.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.280
So you can scroll through the users and

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.880
find one that you want to
be your friend, say Kagure.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.720
Press her name.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.920
And that would add her to
the list of your friends.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.580
Then, with any of these friends, you
can click the little plus icon here and

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.120
that will turn the sharing on.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.180
So if this is Walter's screens and
he just clicked this,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.480
then he'd be sharing with me.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.440
Then when I open my version of the app,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.350
I'd be able to see the new list
that Walter just shared with me.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.110
&gt;&gt; That sounds good, Layla.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.640
So I have another idea to add here.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.150
What if we design the data structure
like this, let me show you my screen.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.470
Here, you've got your list of users and
in each user is a list of push IDs for

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.970
the shopping list they own and
are shared on.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.860
We can set them to some
dummy value like, true.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.670
&gt;&gt; JP, so that does sound interesting
but I'm already seeing one problem.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.430
The issue is,

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.580
how do you use the Firebase list
adapter with this kind of data.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.090
The Firebase list adapter
will be passed to location.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.630
So, I could pass them this user list
location that has all these children.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.780
And then I'll try to
display all these children.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.978
So I could display a list of
these push IDs pretty easily.

00:01:56.978 --> 00:02:00.611
But ultimately, I'm going to try to be
using that populate view method to make

00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:02.217
a list item that looks like this.

00:02:02.217 --> 00:02:05.332
But I can't get this data here unless
I make some additional listeners, and

00:02:05.332 --> 00:02:07.280
it just sounds like a lot of overhead.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.639
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's rough.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.252
You could duplicate some of the data or
possibly use some Firebase built-in

00:02:13.252 --> 00:02:17.226
filtering capabilities to only
grab the list you have access to.

00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:19.709
I'll look into those but
honestly, right now I’m beat,

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.188
I'll check in tomorrow morning.

00:02:21.188 --> 00:02:22.055
You should get some rest.

00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:25.300
&gt;&gt; Nah, I've got some coffee.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.040
So, I'll think about
it a little bit more.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.430
It's just so
important to get the data right.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.602
I don't think I should work on
anything else until the developer and

00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:33.278
I have a plan.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:36.315
&gt;&gt; If only there were some way to
know how users would use the app and

00:02:36.315 --> 00:02:39.249
what kind of performance
constraints you need to deal with.

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.570
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.369
Well, it's not like we
could see to the future.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.402
&gt;&gt; I certainly can't.

00:02:44.402 --> 00:02:47.355
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; All right, good night.

00:02:47.355 --> 00:02:50.174
[SOUND]
