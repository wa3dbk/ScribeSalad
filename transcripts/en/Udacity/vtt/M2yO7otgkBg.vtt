00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.540
For this trinomial, we want to find factors of a hundred, that sum to negative

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.023
20. We get the hundred from multiplying 25 times four. These are the factor

00:00:09.023 --> 00:00:14.000
pairs for positive 100. But remember that this is positive 100, and I have a

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.667
negative 20 down here. We need to find factors of positive 100 that sum to

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:22.712
negative 20. This must mean that our factor pair must contain two negative

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:27.312
numbers. So negative ten and negative ten must be the answers here. They

00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:32.952
multiply to give us positive 100 and they sum to negative 20. But before I go to

00:00:32.952 --> 00:00:37.405
do this step, I should have asked myself first, is there a GCF here? Well two

00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:41.461
doesn't go into every number because this one's not even. They don't all share

00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:46.690
an x, and there's no other common factors for 4, 20 and 25 besides one, so I can

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.582
continue factoring as usual. We can factor 5x from the first two terms and a

00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:56.910
negative two from the second two terms. Completing my factoring by grouping, I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.945
have 5x minus 2 times 5x minus 2. Since it's factors repeated, I can simply

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:06.514
write it with a square. Here's my complete factored form. Some of you might have

00:01:06.514 --> 00:01:10.894
taken a shortcut. You might have recognized this as a special pattern. Our first

00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:15.488
term and our last term are perfect squares. So this fits our perfect square

00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:21.430
trinomial pattern. We can just write out answer as 5x minus 2 squared. The a is

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.744
5x and the b is 2.
