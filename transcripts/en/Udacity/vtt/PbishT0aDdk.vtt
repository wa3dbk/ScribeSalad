00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Finding the best value for a single parameter is a pretty easy thing to be doing.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's try something more difficult--optimizing the linear ramp,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that is finding the best value for the point of time at we which we start ramping out the value.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the start may be earlier, the end may be earlier,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the end maybe later, the start maybe later, and so on.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We want to find out which of this curves would produce the highest output.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Not every combination of these two parameters make sense.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We do not want this start time to be larger than the end time.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
That won't really work, so in this diagram the combinations

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
below the diagram now are forbidden, and what our program will be doing,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it will be varying both parameters between 0 and 10 years only in the allowed region

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and it will put dots in that region that show the total amount of harvest

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
for all of these combinations of parameters.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
this blue dot would mean that this specific combination of parameters

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
leads to a rather large total amount, and this smaller dot would mean

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that this combination of parameters leads to a smaller total amount and so on.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The stepping of these two parameters that control the ramp process is already done.

00:01:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Your job is to compute the total amount of harvest and return it in this variable.
