Hi and welcome back to unit4 of CS215.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We call this unit putting things in order or who is your 17th best friend.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So, by now, you might not be surprised that I actually have a magic trick worked out

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that is, actually, in this case relevant to the topic at hand.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, in this magic trick, I'm going to put a bunch of animals in order with your help.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So, here's some data, I have it stored as a Python structure at the moment.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We caught animals--it has 11 animals in it, alphabetized dog to sparrow,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I've gone on the Internet and looked up the speed, how fast each of these animals is;

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
it's weight, approximately in kg;

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Life span, how long they tend to live, and how big their brains are, measured in g.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I did not go and measured these animals' brains.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So, pretty common operation in social network analysis and lots of other problems

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is to be able to put items in order.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, in this particular case, we have a bunch of animals, we like to put them in order,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but there's lots of different dimensions on which to order them.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
What we're going to do is we're going look at a linear combination of these numeric features,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and you're going to pick from me the weight, the positive weights,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to put on each of these different attributes and then we're going to take a sum,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in fact, I got the code right here for you to look at.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
What I'd like you to do is run this code on this data and what you do is you call importance rank

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
on this data set animals and you give it the weights.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I gave a weight of 1 for the speed, 0.4 for the weight,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
2 for the life span, and 0.1 for the brain mass.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So, if you would run it with this weights, it would actually compute a score for each of the animals

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and then print them out in sorted order, but I want you to give your own weight.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Don't use mine because that wouldn't be very tricky with it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Any weight you want just as long as they are not negative or zero.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But the program is going to print out are the numbers 0 through 10 for the 11 different animals

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and I want you to make a note of, I don't know, let's say the fourth highest in the list,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the one that's associated with the number 3,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and I want you to make note of which animal appears in this position

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and mark the corresponding circle.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And what makes this as a magic trick is that the algorithm that I'm using, the running time is so fast,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that it's Î¸(-n), that is to say I can compute the answer to this question

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
before you've asked the question--so, I've already run this.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I know what answer you're going to get, but now, you need to run it to make it so

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and let's see if you're right.
