Now that we have a handle on writing numbers in different ways and working with

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:07.456
exponents, let's look at how we can calculate answers. Let's start with a story.

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:11.118
I set aside a stamp to mail a letter. Then I made two piles of three stamps to

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.679
mail larger packages. How many stamps did I use? All right, this might be a

00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:18.511
fairly simple problem. But let's come up with a diagram to model. This is going

00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:22.377
to be the first quiz for this section. I am going to draw some diagrams and I

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:26.193
want you to choose which one best represents my story. A square is going to

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:30.146
represent a stamp and a circle around them will represent a pile. Okay, is it

00:00:30.158 --> 00:00:33.900
diagram A, diagram B, diagram C or diagram D? Go ahead, make your choice.
