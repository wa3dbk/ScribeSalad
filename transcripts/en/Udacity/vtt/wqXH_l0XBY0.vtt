00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.690
Linux is by far the most popular
operating system of choice for

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.740
web servers on the Internet today.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.630
Some estimates say 80% of
public Internet servers

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.780
are running some flavor of Linux.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.050
So what exactly is Linux?

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.050
Linux is an operating system
similar to Microsoft Windows or

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.940
Apple OS X,
which you might be more familiar with.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.890
The biggest difference with
Linux though is it's free.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.120
Now, when I say free,
you may be thinking of money, and

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.150
that's not necessarily the case.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.140
You may have heard the phrases,
free as in beer and free as in speech.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.080
It's quite popular within
the open source community.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.470
Let's discuss what
each of these means and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.520
how they apply to
the Linux operating system.
