00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, you know that the variance is defined as the quadratic difference

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
of the actual outcomes from the mean.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There's two possible actual outcomes--there's outcome 1

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and outcome 0, both have probability of 0.5.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If 1 is the outcome, here is our difference from the mean--we square this.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If 0 is the outcome, then this is our deviation from the mean.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This guy is about 0.25 after I'm planning to square, so we get in total 0.25.

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You should check if the math is correct.
