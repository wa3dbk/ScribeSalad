00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.710
Now your solution may be a little bit different than ours, so let's take this

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.198
into account when walking through this code. Now you'll notice that the full

00:00:06.198 --> 00:00:09.822
range of the indexes aren't actually used inside of grid. We allow, for

00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:14.601
instance, a z index value to be between 0 and 100. But in reality we only use

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:18.594
about 10 or 11of them. But, the values we do use are actually scattered across

00:00:18.594 --> 00:00:22.410
the number line. You have a bunch of them in the range of 20, some of them in

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.786
50, and then some of then in 90. The naive approach to this solution would be

00:00:26.786 --> 00:00:29.954
to actually Create a simple for Loop, that would represent, and count through,

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:32.978
each of the Z index values, searching through the array, for any entity that

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:38.270
has that value, and rendering them. Rather than wasting the CPU cycles,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.110
reiterating over the list, grips employs a bucketized method. What we do, is if

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.260
an entity is visible given our view rec, we'll actually go through and place

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.030
the entity, in a bucket, based on its Z index value. Much like the hash table

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.970
we used before with the entity class map. So, if we find that the zIndex for a

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.810
given entity already exists in our array, then we simply go ahead and add that

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.248
entity to our array. If we find that the zIndex for an entity does not already

00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:07.587
exist in our array, then we go ahead, create a bucket for that zIndex, so that

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:13.064
future entities that have that same value can be sorted appropriately. Once

00:01:13.064 --> 00:01:16.368
that's done, we go and ahead and assign this entity to its proper z index

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:20.754
bucket. Afterwards, we have a simple sorting function that will sort the

00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:24.394
buckets by their z index value and then iterate over the buckets, drawing each

00:01:24.394 --> 00:01:26.770
entity in turn.
