Just as we can talk about the degree of a
term, we can also talk about the degree of

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:08.675
an entire polynomial. The degree of a
polynomial is just equal to the highest

00:00:08.687 --> 00:00:12.965
degree of any of its terms. So to figure
out the degree of a polynomial we first

00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:17.135
need to figure out the degree of each of
its terms just like we did in the last

00:00:17.147 --> 00:00:20.545
quiz. If we look back at one of the
polynomials we used earlier.

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:26.773
-12x^7+3x^2+64x, we can see that this is a
7th degree polynomial. We figure this out

00:00:26.785 --> 00:00:31.709
by first calculating the degree of each
term, so this one is a seventh degree

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:36.792
term. This is a second degree term, and
this is a first degree term, because of

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:42.141
the invisible 1 next to this x that stands
on its own. The highest number out of 7, 2

00:00:42.153 --> 00:00:45.963
and 1 is 7, so this is a 7th degree
polynomial.
