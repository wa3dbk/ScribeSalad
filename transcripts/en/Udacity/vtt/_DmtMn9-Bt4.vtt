00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.640
I think that entrepreneurs,
when they go out to fundraise,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.930
they have to think about it like,
I think, getting married.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.450
You are about to bring somebody
on board to your business

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.300
that you can't undo afterwards.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.510
So once you bring on board investors,
it's not only just your business.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.220
And you have to acknowledge that and you
have to believe that that's the right

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.530
thing for you and
that's the right thing for the business.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.950
If you can bootstrap, great.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.060
If you don't have to fundraise, great.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.900
But for the vast majority of
businesses in today's tech world,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.620
you have to go out and raise money.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.490
So the downside perhaps is that
it's no longer your business.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.910
I actually think it can
be a very good thing,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.480
because now you're accountable
not just to yourself but for

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.860
other people as well and people that
put their trust and money in you.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.290
And that I find to be a very
invigorating thing for

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.350
a lot of entrepreneurs,
who already are working super hard,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.350
actually upping their game,
because they appreciate

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.100
the responsibility that
comes with raising capital.
