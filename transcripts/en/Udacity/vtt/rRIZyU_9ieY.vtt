00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.694
So to do this, we'll define a Dish class, that both the main dish and Appetizer

00:00:04.694 --> 00:00:08.927
classes inherit from. And Dish will have both init and str methods for

00:00:08.927 --> 00:00:13.330
initializing and representing the Dish as a string. In both main Dish and

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.530
Appetizer, we're going to, to need to override those methods to provide the

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.250
additional behavior that we need for the extra attributes of sides and serves.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.822
So that's one approach. Let me show you what that looks like in code. Here's

00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:29.690
what that looks like in code. We're defining in the Dish class, its base class

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.782
is object, it's an init method, initializes all these attributes and we've got

00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:37.811
the two with default values. And its str class turns it into the string using

00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:41.262
format like this. This is a little complicated, but you've seen this code

00:00:41.262 --> 00:00:45.152
before, so I won't describe it again here. Then the MainDish class is a subclass

00:00:45.152 --> 00:00:50.580
of Dish, so its base class is Dish. It uses super here. It uses super to get the

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.576
Dish in it method and adds sides to it. And in the str method, it uses the super

00:00:55.576 --> 00:01:00.282
classes str method, and it adds the extra information about the sides. The

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:04.452
appetizer cost is similar, it also inherits from Dish. In this case, we're

00:01:04.452 --> 00:01:08.819
adding Serves and we're adding the information about Serves. We avoided a lot of

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:13.629
duplication by using the super str method and the super init method to inherit

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:17.382
those from the Dish class. If you don't like all the supers, there's another way

00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:21.840
we might do this. We still have the same class hierachy and we still have the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.282
same init methods. But, instead of overriding str in main Dish and ppetizer,

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:30.530
we're going to have an extras method. And what extras will do is print all the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.840
extra information about that particular type of Dish. So here's what that code

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.544
looks like. This is all the same. We've changed the str method for a Dish by

00:01:38.544 --> 00:01:43.017
adding extras to it, and extras is the result of calling the extras method on

00:01:43.017 --> 00:01:46.761
self. Now, we can define MainDish like this. Note that we don't need a str

00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:50.706
method in MainDish. We inherit exactly the str method as defined in Dish and we

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:54.887
add extras that prints out the number of sides. Similarly, we can define

00:01:54.887 --> 00:01:58.688
Appetizer. We don't need a str method and define extras to return a string

00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:02.090
giving information about how many people it serves. Which of these two is

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.528
better? Matter of opinion, I think this one is not yet better. The way to make

00:02:06.528 --> 00:02:09.876
this one better would be to use has attribute to make it so it works for other

00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:13.403
kinds of dishes which we haven't defined yet that don't even have an extras.
