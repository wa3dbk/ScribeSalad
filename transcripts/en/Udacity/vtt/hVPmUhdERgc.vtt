00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.906
The length should be 15 feet and the width should be 8 feet. Nice problem

00:00:04.906 --> 00:00:08.514
solving for getting that one correct. To start solving, I would draw a

00:00:08.514 --> 00:00:13.285
rectangle. We'll have a width here and a length here. A dog run is just an

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:18.835
enclosed rectangular area where a dog can play. This would be a bird's eye view

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:24.230
or looking down from up top, into a dog run. We want to start by working on an

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.188
equation for the perimeter and the area. Since we enclosed the dog run using 46

00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:33.860
feet of fencing, we know that all of these or these sides added together would

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.850
be the perimeter or 46 feet. We have enough concrete to cover 120 square feet.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.646
So the area of this rectangle, in the gray, is 120 feet squared. That's what we

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:50.460
can use for A. Now that we have these two equations, we can start to solve our

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.408
system of equations. We want to solve this equation for the length, and then

00:00:55.408 --> 00:01:00.155
substitute that expression in here. I've taken this equation and rewritten it

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:05.450
here. We'll divide each of the terms by 2, and then we'll subtract w from both

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.068
sides to get 23 minus w equals l. We don't change the equation involving the

00:01:11.068 --> 00:01:17.710
area, and now, we're ready to substitute the value of l, here, for 23 minus w.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.546
So after we substitute, we'll have the equation 120 equals the quantity 23

00:01:22.546 --> 00:01:27.668
minus w, times w. We distribute the w to each of the terms to get this new

00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:33.534
equation. And now, we want to solve this quadratic. We add w squared to both

00:01:33.534 --> 00:01:39.700
sides and subtract 23w from both sides to get our new equation. We factor this

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.425
quadratic by finding factors of a 120 that sum to negative 23, those factors

00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:50.920
are negative 15 and negative 8. This means we set each factor equal to 0, so w

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.095
can equal positive 15 or w can equal positive 8. We usually consider the width

00:01:57.095 --> 00:02:00.572
to be the shorter side, so the width will be 8 feet, and the length will be 15

00:02:00.572 --> 00:02:05.583
feet. And, as a quick check, if we add up all the sides around the rectangle,

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:11.320
we'll get 46 feet, which was our original perimeter. And for the area, if we

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.730
multiply the length times the width, we'll have 15 times 8, which equals 120

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.773
feet squared. This also checks. This means the dimensions are 15 feet by 8

00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:25.770
feet, the length by the width.
