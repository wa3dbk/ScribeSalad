00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One thing that's come up a lot in this class
--a question I've seen a lot on the forums--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is how do I organize code.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You don't want to keep all your stuff in one Python file. What's the correct way to organize things.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The first thing I had to say is there is no correct answer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Code organization--whether you're writing web apps or 
any other type of software--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
is something that comes from experience 
and you can develop your own style.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When I'm building a web app, generally 
things start off in one file,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and in this file we probably have 
a section for handlers.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
These are the classes that define what 
we do when a particular URL is hit.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Almost every framework I've worked in 
has this notion of a handler.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It also has this notion of a URL mapping.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This maps a URL to a particular handler.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We've dealt with this a lot in this lecture.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
There is also some DB stuff, some objects, the 
models, the things we're actually working on--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
blog posts, pieces of art from ASCII Chan, links 
and comments, and that sort of thing.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Then almost immediately I have 
separate files for static content--

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
things like CSS, JavaScript.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.646
We haven't done any JavaScript in this class really.

00:00:56.646 --> 00:01:00.000
Images I store separately. You could encode them 
into your file, but that doesn't make sense.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.215
You just store them separately. Generally 
you serve them separately as well.

00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:04.000
App Engine makes it easy to do that.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Another thing that's almost always separate 
from the beginning are templates.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.784
I almost always separate templates from the beginning.

00:01:08.784 --> 00:01:12.000
I didn't teach them from the beginning in 
this class because I didn't want to explain

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
HTML and new Python and also this new 
mini-language of templates all at the same time.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I've never actually taught templates directly in this class,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
although most of you seem to be using them at this point.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You've found the documentation. 
People have talked about them in forums.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.707
These are always separate.

00:01:25.707 --> 00:01:28.000
As things grow, this file here is actually my main file.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It's actually often called main.py, at least for me.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The first thing I do is I pull out the DB models.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I generally have one file if it's required. 
We don't need this in App Engine.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Refer to it as the ORM.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I almost always write my own ORM. I don't 
really like the home-brewed ones.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
ORM stands for oject-relational mapping.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This is a piece of code that basically 
maps your Python objects

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to the relational database.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Often it'll have a little query language that 
compiles into SQL--that sort of thing.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We haven't had to deal with any of that in this class,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
because the App Engine provides it to us.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The db.model thing we've been using 
to interact with the Google datastore--

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that's basically an ORM.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The data model underlying it isn't strictly relational.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Effectively what it's doing is taking your 
Python objects and abstracting away

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
querying and cursoring and all of that stuff you 
have to do to get stuff in and out of the database.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I generally have a separate file for each type of data.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
In our case, we've been talking about posts and art.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
As our systems grow and you have 
more datatypes and users ,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I generally pull those apart into different files 
and have a bunch of class-specific

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
functions in each of these--password hashing and 
all that stuff would go in a users file.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Functions to get the top post and top arts 
would go in those separate files.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I kind of pull all of that out.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The next thing I almost always have is some sort of utils.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I usually have a utils file or utils module
--a series of files in a directory--

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that basically have all the random stuff
--things like make<u>secure</u>val

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and make<u>salt and random</u>string. 
Handy things.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Generally, I want to put as much into 
utils as I can--just a list of flat functions

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that have no dependencies on any other part of the project.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The reason I do this is so that I can test these things.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
These are often little helpful files that 
any piece of the project can manage.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I have a lot of date manipulation stuff in these files,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a lot of string manipulation, escaping stuff
--all those sort of functions that I write

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I usually put in a file. It usually starts out called utils.py.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
It's really important that it's always a one-way inheritance.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Handlers can import from utils. 
Databases can import from utils.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Anything can import from utils, but utils 
never brings in other parts of the project.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
That just kind of keeps things simple,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and if you think about it that way, 
you'll have this nice, clean file

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
with a bunch of handy functions.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
If you look at Reddit's source code, there is 
maybe about 100 handy little functions

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that we use all over the code. I 
usually throw that in one spot.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Then the final thing I do, and this usually 
takes more time as the project grows

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
is I take handlers out of main.py.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You might have separate files for each type of handler.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
For the homeworks I may have 
a separate file for just the blog,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
a separate file for ASCII Chan,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
a separate file for those Unit 2 ones--the rot13 stuff,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and then main.py is basically the url mapping 
and then a bunch of imports.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Then these guys would import whatever 
database pieces they need.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It kind of keeps things separate.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Sometimes it's really hard to enforce this, 
and you can have what's called

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
a circular import where one file--rot13 
may depend on some generic files

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that are defined in main.py, which depends 
on the actual handlers in rot13 itself.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
You get this kind of circular import.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Generally when you start having circular imports 
that means it's time to pull some

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
common piece of functionality out so 
the inheritance only goes one way.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
For example, I have that generic handler
--I think I've been calling it blog_handler

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
in my homework solutions--that just 
kind of has all that helpful stuff on it.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
That would get pulled out into its own file so that 
main.py could import it, if it needs it at all.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
The big groups of handlers can import from there as well.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
This is basically how I organize things.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I'm going to draw a slight different picture 
of how the file system might look.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We'll leave it at that. Now, again, this may not 
apply to you, but this is what's worked for me.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Usually at my top level I have /main.py.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I probably have some sort of common file 
that's called like handlers.py

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
or something of that nature that 
basically has the generic handler--

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
things that happen on every single request.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Then I'll probably have a directory called /lib 
that might have some of the DB stuff,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
which may have all of my models.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I may have utils.py and any of the 
specific stuff that we're doing.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Got that generic handlers.py.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
It might have the other handler as the blog.py, 
the rot13.py--that sort of thing.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The bulk of the code is either in handlers.py 
or in each of these specific things.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
These are the pieces that import from 
all the other parts of my projects.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
That's generally kind of how I start. 
Things grow from there.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Of course, I have directories for templates and static. 
I'll keep things organized that way.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
If we need subdirectories in either of this, I may add them.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But actually generally for me my templates directory 
is just a monster pile of templates.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Of course, as you get more advanced with templates, 
these can start inheriting from each other.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I almost always have something like a base.html.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Then most of my main templates will inherit from this.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
There you go. I hope that helps. Many of you have 
been asking. Let's move onto the next piece.
