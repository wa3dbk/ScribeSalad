00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.348
So now, let's calculate Tukey's HSD and see if any of the sample means for the

00:00:04.348 --> 00:00:09.874
amount of food cows ate is honestly significantly different. Use the

00:00:09.874 --> 00:00:15.510
studentized range statistic table to find the critical value of q. You'll need

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.760
to know the number of groups we're comparing, as well as the degrees of freedom

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.586
for the within group variability. You'll notice that you can calculate Tukeys

00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:31.629
HSD for alpha equals 0.01 and 0.05. Calculate this for alpha equals 0.05.
