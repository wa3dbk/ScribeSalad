Through helping Grant mull over this cleaning solution issue, we learned about

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.865
the use and the importance of points of intersections on graphs. When two lines

00:00:08.877 --> 00:00:13.033
cross one another, the coordinates of the point where that happens give us

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:17.352
values of variables that satisfy the equations of all of the lines that pass

00:00:17.364 --> 00:00:22.319
through that point. So, we are able to use this knowledge to solve for different

00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:27.016
variables. We could just take the equations corresponding to either line, figure

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:31.410
out how to set one side of one equation equal to one side of the other equation,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.993
and then solve for the unknown variable. That would give us a new coordinate of

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:40.662
that point of intersection. But, what if instead we didn't have a graph? What if

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:46.344
you just had an equation, and not just any equation but an equation with one

00:00:46.356 --> 00:00:51.790
variable, something like 3 x plus 4 equals 19? Now that we know we can find

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:57.745
values for variables through finding points of intersection of lines, can you

00:00:57.757 --> 00:01:02.630
think of two lines we could graph whose point of intersection would help us

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:07.360
solve this equation? Please put a two variable equation in each of these boxes

00:01:07.372 --> 00:01:11.755
that we could graph on the same coordinate plane to help us work with this

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:16.619
equation. This definitely requires a little bit of outside the box thinking. So,

00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:17.682
just give it a try.
