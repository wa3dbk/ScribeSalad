00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.110
Preattentive processing taps into our automatic processes of

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.030
vision and perception.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.950
When preattentive processing occurs,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.150
we are able to instantly recognize an element in a visualization.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.920
It's the same reason why this blue bar becomes instantly apparent in

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.210
this forest of orange bars.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.530
Here I'm using color, in particular, hue as preattentive attribute.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.120
I could also use color intensity to create the same effect.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.160
Here two bars pop out from the page.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.960
So color hue and color intensity can be used as preattentive attributes.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.329
But there are also other preattentive attributes that can,

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.437
we can use to highlight information or to lead the eye in visualizations.

00:00:42.437 --> 00:00:46.067
In Colin Ware's book Information Visualization Perception for

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:50.030
Design, he describes four general categories for these attributes.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.370
And they are color, form, movement and spatial position.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.350
We can change the form of objects, such as their line width, curvature, size or,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.320
in this case, the shape.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.690
Movement is another form of preattentive processing.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.380
For these squares, I'm using a flicker effect to draw attention to one of them.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.190
You might have similar fade ins or

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.790
fade outs for portions of your visualization that are interactive or

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.140
those that highlight particular data values or trends in a visualization.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.390
Finally, spacial position can be employed as preattentive attribute.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.700
You might find this useful for

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.920
drawing the eye towards titles, legends, or annotations.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.100
For more examples of preattentive processing check out the links in

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.080
the instructor notes.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.100
As a side note, preattentive attributes can be used together but

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.880
they may achieve different results.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.470
Here, color and form are used.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.160
Notice that form either a square or

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.710
a circle is randomly distributed throughout the grid.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.970
But the color attribute creates a clean boundary down the grid.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.870
In this example, the reverse is true.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.390
Color is randomly distributed to shapes throughout this grid, but

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.230
notice that form does not do the partitioning of the grid as well as in

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.340
this previous example.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.180
In this second example, the horizontal shape boundary is masked by color or hue.
