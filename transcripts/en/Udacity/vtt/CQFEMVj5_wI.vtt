00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:06.030
Let's take a quick example. Suppose the message forma is as follows. Y, d and x,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:12.590
where x is the origin of the message. Y is the node being claimed as root and do

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.730
is the distance of the particular node sending

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.100
this message, x from a claimed root. So, initially

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.290
every switch in the network broadcast a message

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.410
like x,0,x to indicate that the node that it

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.730
think itself is the root. When other switches hear

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.860
this method, they compare the ID of the sender to

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.070
their owner ID, and they update their opinion of who

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.000
the root is based on the comparison of these IDs.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.800
Let's suppose that we have the following graph and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.450
switch number 4 thinks it's the root. So we will

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:50.170
send a message 4, 0, 4 to nodes 2 and 7. But 2 also thinks it is the root, so.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.520
4 is going to receive the message 2, 0, 2

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.010
from node 2, and then it's going to realize that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.260
4 is just one hop away from node 2. So

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.460
node 4 will update its view of the root to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.129
be node 2, eventually 4 will also hear a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.980
message 2, 1, 7 from node 7; indicating that node

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.800
7 thinks it is one hop away. From its view

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.960
of the root, which is node 2. It will realize

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.310
that the path through node 7 is a longer

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.595
path to the root, and it will remove the link

00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:25.740
4, 7 from the tree. We can repeat this process

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.520
and ultimately we will end up with a spanning tree.
