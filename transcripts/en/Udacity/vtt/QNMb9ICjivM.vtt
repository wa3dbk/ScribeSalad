00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.710
So let's see what happens if we substitute zero for near

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.990
in the equation. Here's the substitution. Let's simplify. This element goes to

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.800
negative one and this element goes to zero. If you look at

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.970
this matrix and examine its effect on the various coordinates, you'll notice

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.300
he following: first, the last collumn was all zeros, so the

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.230
W value of the coordinate will have no effect on the result.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.160
This leaves only the incoming Z value of the coordinate affecting the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.480
output Z and W value. Whatever the Z value is coming in,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.180
the resulting Z and W will be that original

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.630
Z value multiplied by negative 1. In other words,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.790
the output Z and W values will always be

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.700
identical. When you divide by W, the result will always

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.595
be 1, except for the case where W is

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:39.780
0. The distance of an object from the camera

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.010
will almost always be 1, which is not a

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.209
useful result if you're trying to use the Z buffer.
