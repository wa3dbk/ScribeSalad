To start our review, we'll look at the graph with the function f of x equals 1

00:00:04.376 --> 00:00:09.784
over x squared minus 7x plus 12. This graph has lots of interesting features,

00:00:09.784 --> 00:00:13.229
but we'll start with some you're familiar with from earlier units just to make

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:17.810
sure you haven't forgotten about those. We always want to know the x and

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.205
y-intercepts. Does it have x and y-intercepts? If so, what are they? If not,

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:27.919
type none. Separate multiple answers with semi-colons as necessary.
