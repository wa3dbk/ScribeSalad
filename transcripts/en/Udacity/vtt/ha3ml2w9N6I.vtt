00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.250
We'll now go through each of the structured paragraphs in the Gang of Four

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.130
description of the composite pattern. First off is intent, which is a summary of

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.850
the value provided by the pattern. The intent of the composite pattern is to

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.940
describe a way of representing whole-parts hierarchies in such a way that,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.600
that the client treats individual parts and composites uniformly.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.040
The next section of the description is called the motivation section, and

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.100
this typically takes the form of a scenario, or story demonstrating that having

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.470
a problem, having such a solution would be valuable. Earlier, we used Graphic as

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.040
an example. Clients of Graphic shouldn't have to test elements to see whether

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.580
they are leads or composites, if all they want to do is copy them, for example.
