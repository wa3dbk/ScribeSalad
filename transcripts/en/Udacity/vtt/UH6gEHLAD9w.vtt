Well, unless Grant plans on paying other
people to buy his products, he'll

00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:08.365
presumably bring in some money each time
he sells a nozzle, and each time he sells

00:00:08.377 --> 00:00:12.378
a set of wipers. This means that the money
he earns is going to be equal to the money

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.373
he makes from his wiper sales plus the
money he makes from the nozzle sales,

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:21.680
which is just this first choice up here.
For example, let's say, just picking

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:27.850
numbers out of the air, that Grant decides
to sell a wiper set for $5 and one nozzle

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:33.570
for $3. Well, then we know that money
earned at that point would be equal to $5

00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:39.687
plus $3 or let's see, if I was going to
pay for these, it would be 5, 6, 7, $8

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.648
total. So all we would do to find the
total money earned would be to add the

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:48.093
cost of each of the products together.
