00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.630
And of course, the answer here is 1/2^n because for each vertex you have to make the right choice.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.930
If the vertex does not belong to the largest possible clique, then you have to assign it a 0

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.470
and if the vertex does belong to the largest clique, then you have to hope

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.680
that the random algorithm you're using is assigning it a 1.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.610
And the probability of each correct assignment is one-half and you have to do this n times.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.900
So the probability of finding the largest possible clique using simple pure randomness,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.510
which of course is the same as 1/2^n which is exponentially small.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.010
We can't just hope to get the best solution by pure chance alone.

00:00:38.010 --> 99:59:59.000
We need a more intelligent or strategic approach for this.
