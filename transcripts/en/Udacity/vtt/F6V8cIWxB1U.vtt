00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.122
This is the equation in vertex form and the vertex is four comma one. Great

00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:10.517
work if you found these two. We simply rewrite this trinomial expression as a

00:00:10.517 --> 00:00:16.935
perfect square. X minus four squared equals this polynomial. We keep the factor

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:21.792
of 2 in front. and then we just combine the like terms of positive 33 and

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:27.870
negative 32 to get positive one. This equation is in vertex form, so here is

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:36.995
our vertex. We have an h value of 4 and a k value of positive 1. So h comma k.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:43.644
Keep in mind that we find the h value by setting this binomial equal to 0. So x

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:48.949
would equal positive 4. The k value is simply the number on the end, so it's

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.553
positive 1.
