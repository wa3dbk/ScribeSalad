00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.800
The view contains three
sets of elements.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.310
The first element is the toolbar,
now styled in white.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.910
The second set is a view
reminiscent of the Today view.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.660
And the third set contains
additional weather detail.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.480
Some quick measurement shows that
the top set of Today elements is one and

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.220
a half times the height of the bottom
half of the detail elements.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.120
Sounds like a job for
a LinearLayout with weights.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.830
Inside of the sets, we see some
interesting Android layout techniques.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.680
Two spacer views are in place above and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.595
below that vertically center
the content of the Today styled view.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:34.355
Following the rules of material design,

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:37.833
we see 16dp spacers being used
liberally in the vertical direction,

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:42.835
along with 32dp spacers in the
horizontal direction for the details.

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:45.515
But we're still missing
the core of these layouts.

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:49.940
It would be pretty easy to build the top
one with a nested LinearLayout, and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.330
slightly tricky with a RelativeLayout.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.150
But it turns out that both of
these sections are built with only

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.240
one layout each, a GridLayout.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.098
GridLayout was added to Android for
the Ice Cream Sandwich release.

00:01:03.098 --> 00:01:06.690
Its goal is to address the limitations
of Android's nested layouts,

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.140
which fall into three basic categories.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.970
Firstly, the inability
to control alignment

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.170
along both axes simultaneously.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.630
Performance problems in
hierarchies that are too deep,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.220
especially when you're using expensive
features such as layout_weight.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.260
And unsuitability for design tools
that support freeform editing.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.020
And yes, we are looking at you,
RelativeLayout.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.270
As its name suggests, GridLayout uses
rows and columns to layout views.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.990
You can see it adjust the grid
automatically as controls in

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.060
the righthand column get larger.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.671
Using GridLayout,
you give constraints to each view,

00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:42.502
as well as specify what to do
with the extra space in the cell,

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:45.298
using the GridLayout's own
version of layout_gravity.

00:01:45.298 --> 00:01:48.957
The GridLayout then attempts to preserve
the constraints as it solves the problem

00:01:48.957 --> 00:01:50.695
of laying out the view.

00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:54.814
Android Lollipop added the ability to
GridLayout to reapportion space among

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:58.705
its child's views automatically
using layout_weights.

00:01:58.705 --> 00:02:01.665
Fortunately, the support library
let's us use this latest and

00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:03.590
greatest version of GridLayout.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.510
GridLayout is a separate
support component.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.300
It requires a separate entry in
your Gradle dependency list.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.100
Here are a bunch of layout
elements in no particular layout.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.255
If we place the layouts into a default
GridLayout, it behaves similar to

00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:21.361
LinearLayout, although it aligns
text to the baseline by default.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.600
We didn't have to put the height or

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.660
width of each into the layout XML
because GridLayout assumes wrap content.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.850
Here is the underlying grid
produced by this layout.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.350
Changing the orientation to vertical
makes it perform very similar to

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.160
a vertical LinearLayout.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.780
And here is the grid
produced by that layout.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.460
Changing things back to the default
orientation of horizontal, but

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.500
giving the GridLayout
a column count of two,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.610
causes GridLayout to automatically
place the child views into columns.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.330
Here's the underlying grid
produced by this layout.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.180
Explicitly setting the icon view to the
second layout row, first layout column

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.990
causes the GridLayout to move the cloud
icon to the first column in the second

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.740
row and continue laying out
all other views from there.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.960
Here's the underlying grid
produced by this layout.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.180
But even better,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.950
we can use layout_columnSpan to have
the date span both of the columns.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.900
Here's the underlying grid
produced by that layout.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.570
Now we can distribute the extra
weight across all columns by adding

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.530
a layout_columnWeight
to all of the columns.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.790
Note that you need to add this to all
layouts in the column in each row for

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.669
it to have the desired effect.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.020
And here's the underlying
grid produced by this layout.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.220
We can tell the GridLayout to center
a view horizontally within its cell

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.250
by adding layout_gravity
equals center_horizontal.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.210
By adding this to each layout,
we get this effect.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.790
Note that the two columns
aren't exactly even,

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.150
because we only distributed
the extra weight between them.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.070
It looks close because they
contain similar sized elements.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.900
You can really see that in
the grid produced by this layout.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.930
Material Design defines
these default styles.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.600
These sizes and styles were developed
to balance content density and

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.560
reading comfort under
typical usage conditions.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.300
Consider using these styles
whenever possible as

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.020
it will help you make
good design decisions.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.340
The support library provides
the definitions for

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.360
all of these font styles.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.904
Here's how you would reference
the Display 4 112sp style in

00:04:19.904 --> 00:04:22.460
the textAppearance of a TextView.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.420
We're going to do our best to make
sunshine use as many of these styles

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.610
as we can while implementing
the new design.
