00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In summary, you really learned about correlation coefficients.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's larger than 0.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If there's a positive relationship between x and y.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's smaller than 0 if the relationship is negative.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's equal to 0 if there is no relationship.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The magnitude of r goes to 1 as the relationship becomes increasingly linear

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
without any noise or any deviation from the line.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is a powerful measure.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
For any data set with multiple variables,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
you can now tell how much variables relate to each other.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If someone, for example, shows you the salary of a person and the age of a person,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
you can say they're really correlated, or you could say they're not correlated at all.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Whatever you say, with this--what I believe to be a very simple formula,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the formula right over here--you can now compute for any data set how much x and y relate.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That's called the correlation, and it's really an important lesson in statistics.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I use it all the time to inspect data to make a statement

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
how much two variables relate to each other in a linear way. Thank you.
