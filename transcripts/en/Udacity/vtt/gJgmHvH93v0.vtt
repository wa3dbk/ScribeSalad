If you have had a dream in a language different than the one you usually speak,

00:00:03.552 --> 00:00:06.891
this will be a great opportunity to discuss it on the forums, and some people

00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:13.266
have been known to dream in a different language. I had a student in one of my

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.962
classes, who was a native Spanish speaker, and learned how to speak English for

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:20.378
school, but he told me, every once in a while, even though he spoke English

00:00:20.378 --> 00:00:26.504
almost all the time, he would have a dream in Spanish. Go to the forums and

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:28.180
share your experiences.
