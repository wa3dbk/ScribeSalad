You might not have chosen all these answers, which is totally okay. I think all

00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:07.662
of these are great, and here's why. We know successful students make mistakes.

00:00:07.753 --> 00:00:11.713
More importantly successful students learn from their mistakes. In this course

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:15.568
even if you don't get a problem right on the first time, you should definitely

00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:19.209
try again. If you try the problem again, you're likely to get the correct

00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:23.364
answer. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Then, you can also go back and write yourself a note to remember what

00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:27.078
went wrong. The thing that I want to emphasize, is that mistakes are okay. You

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.844
might even find some mistakes that we made while making the videos. While we try

00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:34.482
to bring you the best material, we aren't perfect. In the first unit, you'll

00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:38.095
even see my own handwriting and my drawings improve. I made a ton of mistakes

00:00:38.107 --> 00:00:41.759
while making these videos, but for me, the most important part was to reflect

00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:45.159
and learn from those mistakes. To be successful in this course, we also

00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:48.677
recommend you take notes while watching the videos. These notes can be helpful

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:52.293
for you to solve practice problems, and also help you review content later. It's

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:55.790
a great idea to break up your notes into individual lessons. That way, you can

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:59.890
remember what you learned from each video segment. Third, research tell us that

00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:04.660
the most learning occurs while working in groups. Students don't succeed just by

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:09.130
working harder or studying longer. They do better by talking about that. By

00:01:09.142 --> 00:01:13.950
discussing it, by practicing it, and teaching others. Usually from lecture, you

00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:18.535
only remember 5% of what you hear. From reading, you only remember 10%. Audio

00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:22.855
and visual 20, and demonstrations 30%. These are considered to be passive ways

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:26.505
of learning because they don't rely on much from you to, well, learn. When you

00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:30.130
participate on the forms, or complete practice problems after videos, you're

00:01:30.142 --> 00:01:33.805
becoming an active learner. These are the best things you can do throughout the

00:01:33.817 --> 00:01:37.405
course to help yourself learn. And if you're really mastered something, that

00:01:37.417 --> 00:01:41.610
means you can teach anyone. That's the best. Fina lly, if you're half listening

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:45.865
or losing focus, just stop. Take a break and come back and try again. You want

00:01:45.877 --> 00:01:50.030
to avoid guessing through the quizzes or trying to rush through the material.

00:01:50.127 --> 00:01:54.245
One thing we know about learning is that there's an actual physical need for

00:01:54.257 --> 00:01:58.836
time to process new material. So give each question your full attention and your

00:01:58.848 --> 00:02:03.130
thoughts. Congratulations on completing your first question. We hope you have a

00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:07.383
better idea about how to succeed in this course. When you're ready, come join us

00:02:07.395 --> 00:02:08.502
in visualize algebra.
