00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.862
Here's our first challenge problem for u-substitution. Notice that we have

00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:08.289
fractional exponents in our original equation. What type of substitution do you

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.638
think we can use? And be careful when you go back to solve for the original

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:16.955
value of a. When you think you've got it, write your answer here. Now of

00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:21.535
course, since this is a challenge problem, there won't be a solution. Try your

00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:24.325
best, and if you get stuck, head to the forums and discuss it with some other

00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:25.540
students.
