00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.161
So now that you've completed your chart,
let's take a look at the answers. Let's

00:00:05.173 --> 00:00:10.544
start out by looking at the numbers -1 and
-9. They're both integer, and negative

00:00:10.556 --> 00:00:15.533
integer. Those are the 2 that should be
checked. So now let's take a look at 0.

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:21.114
There are 4 boxes you should have checked,
for zero. You should have checked integer,

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:28.355
zero, whole number, and non-negative
integers. So now let's look at the number

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:35.589
7 and 12. You should have had checked
integer, positive integer, natural number,

00:00:35.728 --> 00:00:43.257
whole number, and non-negative integers
for both of them. Let's look at the last

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:51.943
category of numbers. The numbers 3/4, .5,
and pi. Those don't fit into any category

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:58.318
so you should have checked none of the
above, for 3/4, .5, and pi.
