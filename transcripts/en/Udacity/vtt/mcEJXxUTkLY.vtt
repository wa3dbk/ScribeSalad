00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.858
So now we have a value for h, for this particular equation. But remember what h

00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:09.639
stood for, in the original equation we started working with. H was the amount

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.456
that this graph is shifted horizontally, compared to y equals x squared. Now

00:00:14.456 --> 00:00:19.287
that we found a value for h in this equation, h equals negative 3. Can you find

00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:20.618
a value for k as well?
