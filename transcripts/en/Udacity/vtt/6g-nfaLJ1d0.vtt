00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is the Counter mode would be faster.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The reason for this is with CBC mode, there's a data dependency.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Then we can't start doing this encryption until we know the value of the previous ciphertext block

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
so we can't run all these encryptions in parallel.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That's one major drawback of CBC mode.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
With Counter mode, well, we can actually compute all these encryptions

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
before we even know the message.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
These values and the expensive operation here is not the EXORs,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
EXORs are very cheap.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Encryption is expensive. So we could actually pre-compute,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
for a given nonce, all these encrypted counters,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And then once we know the contents of the file,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we can do those EXORs, also in parallel,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but those are very quick. So all of these encrypted blocks could be

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
computed in parallel using many processors.

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So that's a big advantage of Counter mode over CBC mode.
