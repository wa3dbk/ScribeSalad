00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.760
Let's first look at
Invariant to Rotation.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.360
Here's a simple example again.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.640
Let's look at this.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.470
And I have the same corner in this
instance is appearing in another image

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.210
with a rotation.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.890
Now in this case, if we were to
go through the whole process, and

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.830
computing the details that would
actually let us do the ellipse,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.290
which basically would have
the eigenvalues and stuff like that.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.130
Again, we're not doing this directly,
but we actually look at

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.420
second movements, which allows
us to get similar information.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.320
For this point and this point,
the eigenvalues should be the same.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.500
The size of the ellipse that we're
looking at should be the same,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.310
but what should not be,
is of course, the rotation.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.910
So it's orientation has
changed from this to this, but

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.020
the eigenvalues remain the same.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.240
Since r is only dependent on
the eigenvalues of the ellipse,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.970
it basically suggests that
the corner response function, r,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.890
is invariant to image rotation.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.990
So, this object can be
rotated completely,

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.910
as long as these values are the same.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.129
We should still get the same r function,
and with threshold and stuff,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.690
we'll still get the same point.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.610
And in fact, that's what would
suggest that these two corners of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.300
this image would be
identified in both the pairs.
