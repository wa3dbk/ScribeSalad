00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Congratulations. You just learned about pie charts.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
They're great for relative data, and they're wonderful for comparing

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which slice of the pie is bigger.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So in the next class we'll look at relative data again, and we'll pick up the touchy issue

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of gender discrimination in college admissions,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
using a study originally performed at UC Berkeley here in California.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This'll be a really deep statistical question, and I promise you you'll be surprised by the result.
