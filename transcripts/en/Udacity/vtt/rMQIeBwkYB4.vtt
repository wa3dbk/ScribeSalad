00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.910
We've already learned about Athena's 
internship at the architecture firm.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.520
But she also has another part-time job, 
tutoring.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.070
Her job at the firm pays her $2000 every 
month.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.558
So, let's use a function to represent the 
total amount that she makes from this job

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:21.620
in x months. 
That will give us f of x equals 2,000 x.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.210
She makes about $1,000 a month from 
tutoring.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.998
So, we can say that g of x, the total 
amount of money she's made from tutoring,

00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:34.100
equals 1,000 x. 
Where x is still number of months.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.770
So, how much does Athena make, in total 
each month?

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.370
Now if we say that h of x, is equal to 
the total amount of money, that Athena

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.309
has made after x months, then what 
expression is that equal to?
