00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.910
Now it's your turn to write the code to

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.050
query for all conferences. You're going to need to add

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.810
the query conferences method, in the conference API class. You're

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.310
going to need to identify the function as an endpoint

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.800
method that uses HTTP post. And, now, if you

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.550
can't remember how to do that, just look at some

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.520
of the other functions in the file. An implement queryConferences

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.950
to return all conferences sorted by name. And when you've

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.070
written your function, go ahead and test it on

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.260
localhost. And that is important. It's really important that

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.980
you test it on localhost first. Don't cheat. Don't

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.560
deploy direct to appspot. You'll find, if you do

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.440
that, it probably won't work. After you run it

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.210
on localhost, go ahead and try out the query,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.500
you can either do that in the API Explorer,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.780
or you can go to the show conferences page.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.570
Doesn't matter which way you do it, but make sure

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.900
that you run it on localhost first. And then, after you

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.490
test it on the localhost, I do want you to

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.400
deploy it to appspot. Now we're going to check that your application

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.410
actually works, and that it does create conferences and queries

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.510
conferences. I want you to go ahead and create a conference

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.240
called Udacity that's going to take place in London. It's important

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.390
that you get these right, that the name is actually Udacity,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.160
spelled right, and that the city is in London.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.580
Otherwise, our testing script might not work. And then go

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.780
ahead and enter your app ID here. This needs to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.775
be the app ID, the app that's running on appspot.
