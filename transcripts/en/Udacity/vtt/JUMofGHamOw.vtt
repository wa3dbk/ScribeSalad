00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.760
How about data transfer. Well once again,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.480
when you think about full virtualization, data transfer

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.180
is implicit. Any data movement that has to

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.480
happen between they hypovisor and the fully virtualized

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.700
outputting system happens implicitly. In a para

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.870
virtual setting, for example in xen, there's an

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.100
opportunity again, to innovate because you can be

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.500
explicit about the data movement from the guest

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.090
operating system into the hypervisor, and vice-versa. There

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.875
are two aspects to resource management and accountability

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:35.920
,when it comes to data transfer. The first

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.540
is, the CPU time. So when ,an interrupt

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.460
comes in, for instance, from a device, hypervisor

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.030
has to demultiplex the data That is coming

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.040
from the device to the domains very quickly

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.320
upon an interrupt. And that is CPU time involved,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.140
in making such copies. And, the hypervisor

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.890
has to account for the computation time from

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.690
managing the buffers on behalf of the virtualized

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.349
operating system above it. The CPU time accountability

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.140
is crucial from the point of your

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.320
billing and data centers, and therefore hypervisors pay

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.540
a lot of attention to, how CPU time

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.540
is accounted for and charged to the appropriate

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.830
virtual machines. The second aspect of a data transfer

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.570
is how the memory buffers are managed. There is

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.260
a space issue. The first is a time issue.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.490
CPU time issue. The second is a space issue. Meaning,

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.860
how are the memory buffers allocated? And how are

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.330
they managed, either by the guest operating system or

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.560
by the hypovisor? As I said in the context,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.210
the full virtualization that is available to scope for innovation.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.710
But in the context of paravirtualization, there's

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.670
a lot of scope for innovation in the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.590
way memory buffers are handled. Between the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.380
guest operating system and the hypervisor. Specifically, looking

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.110
at Xen as an instance of para

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.370
virtualization, let's look at the opportunities for innovation

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.940
in the guest OS to Xen communication.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.220
Xen provides asynchronous IO rings, which is basically

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.330
a data structure that is shared Between

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.680
the guest and the Xen for communication. Any

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.620
number of these, data structures, that is any number of these I/O rings can be

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.700
allocated for handling all the device I/O

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.020
needs of a particular guest domain. The I/O

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.270
ring itself. Is just a set of

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.280
descriptors. What you see here, they're all descriptors

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.760
that are available in this data structure. And

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.620
it's a ring data structure, that's why it's

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.220
called IO ring. And we'll talk about how it is used in a minute. The idea

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.620
is, requests from the guest can be placed

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.030
in this IO ring by populating these descriptors.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.790
Every descriptor is a unique I/O request coming

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.200
from the guest operating system. So every request,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.030
is going to have a unique ID associated with

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.310
that particular request coming from the guest operating

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.970
system. And recall, what I said earlier that is the I/O ring is specific to a

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.820
guest. So every guest can declare a set of I/O rings As data structures for its

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.600
communication with xen. Now, in responding to the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.770
request from the guest, xen, after it completes

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.720
processing the request, it'll place a response back in the same I/O ring in one

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.080
of these descriptors, and that. This pointer's going to

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.900
have the same unique ID that was used

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.800
to communicate the request in the first place.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.340
So ,it's sort of a symmetric relationship between

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.980
the guest and Xen, in terms of request

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.880
and response for things that the guest wants

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.110
Xen to get done on its behalf. And for Xen to communicate back ,to the guest

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.920
that has completed what was requested of them.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.690
So the guest is the producer of requests.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.220
So it has a pointer, into this data structure that says ,where it has to place

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.190
the next request. So, this is a pointer

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.560
that is manipulated, meaning modified, by the guest.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.079
But it is readable by Xen. So there's only

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.745
one guy that can modify, that is a guest. But

00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:22.290
Xen can look at this pointer. It's a shared pointer

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.270
in that sense. For example, the guest operating system may

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.530
have placed new requests, and that's why it has

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.080
moved it's pointer to here, indicating that it has placed

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.910
new requests. This is the next empty spot, where it

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.660
can place new requests, after these two requests. The consumer

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.240
for the request produced by the guest operating

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.840
system, is of course Xen. And it is

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.360
processing requests in the order in which, they've

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.900
been produced by the guest operating system. And

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.170
therefore, it has the pointer into this IO

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.080
ring data structure, saying Where exactly it is

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.770
presently servicing requests from this guest operating system.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.350
So right now ,the pointer is pointing here indicating

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.280
that Xen is yet to process these two requests that have been queued by the

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.055
producer. Meaning, the guest operating system, into this

00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:18.280
I/O ring data structure. So this pointer that

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.770
the request consumer has is private to Xen. It is just telling Xen ,where it is

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.980
in processing requests from the producer. And the

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.350
difference between these two pointers is telling how

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.450
many requests are outstanding so far as

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.660
Xen is concerned, in terms of processing. Request

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.950
emanating from the guest. Similar to request production,

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.730
Xen is going to be the guy that is

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.850
offering responses back to the guest operating system.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.750
So Xen, is the response producer. So it's

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.990
going to have a pointer, where it can place

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.220
new responses. So once again, this pointer is

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.930
a shared pointer updated by Xen, but can be read by the guest. So these are two

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.100
new responses that Xen has placed in the I/O Ring in response to request

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.410
that it has already processed, but these

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.470
responses have not yet been picked up. By

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.600
the producer. The guest operating system has a

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.425
pointer that says where it is in this

00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:23.830
I/O ring data structure, in terms of picking

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.400
up the responses coming from Xen. Xen has produced

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.960
these two new responses as a result of

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.050
processing some prior requests. From the guest operating system,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.150
but the guest operating system is yet to

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.640
process this request. So, this pointer is private to

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.820
the guest operating system that is telling it, where

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.760
it is in processing responses coming back from Xen.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.950
The difference between this pointer and this pointer

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.940
is the number of Responses that are yet to

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.660
be picked-up by the guest operating system. Just to

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.890
recap, the difference between these two pointers is the

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.350
number of requests that are yet to be processed

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.390
by Xen. And the difference between these two pointers

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.630
is the number of responses that are yet to

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.930
be picked-up by the guest. And these slots ,are

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.040
the empty slots. Into which ,new requests

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.320
can be placed by the request producers. The

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.780
request producer moves like this. And the

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.580
response ,taker moves like this. And, the response

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.670
producer moves like this. And the request

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.580
consumer moves like this. And these are the

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.870
empty slots into which. Xen can place additional

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.320
responses as it processes more requests from the

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.710
guest operating system. That's the idea behind this higher ring data structure.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.800
Very powerful extraction that allows the

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.410
guest to place requests [UNKNOWN], and for

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.810
Xen to place responses [UNKNOWN], into

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.020
the data structure. As I mentioned already,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.870
the guests can identify the request for which a particular response is intended,

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.200
because the id that is associated. With the

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.930
response is going to be exactly the same, as

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.680
the ID that was associated with the request in

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.370
the first place. The other thing that, we should

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.010
remember is that these are just descriptors of

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.970
the requests and responses. Any data, that has to

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.970
be passed from the guest to Xen will just

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.260
be a pointer from these descriptors to a machine

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:35.210
page that the guest owns, so that Xen can pick up the data directly, from

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.650
that machine page without any copy. Similarly,

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.919
if the responses given by Xen is going to

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.100
have data associated with it, that will

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.590
again be A pointer from the descriptive data

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.300
structure to the machine page that contains the

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.300
data that Xen wants to pass up to

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:59.500
the guest. In other words, this asynchronous I/O rings is a powerful mechanism,

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:05.820
both for efficient communication between the guest and Xen. And for

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.355
also, avoiding. Copying overhead between the

00:09:10.355 --> 00:09:14.170
para-virtualized guest operating system and Xen,

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:19.410
which is the virtualization layer. We will look at two specific examples,

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.970
on how these I/O rings are used for guest and Xen communication.
