00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.840
Wow, that's a lot of progress.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.740
First, we set up a new project and
then set up the game architecture.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.790
We created the player, added two ways
to control the players movement and

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.980
added the eponymous icicles.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.219
We also learned how to use a fancy
data structure to clean up icicles

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:16.940
we no longer need.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.040
In the next and final level we'll detect
when the player runs into an icicle and

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.570
add a head-up display for
the player's score.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.840
We'll even add a whole new
difficulty select screen.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.350
See you there.
