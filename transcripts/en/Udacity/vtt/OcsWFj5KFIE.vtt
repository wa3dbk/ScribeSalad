00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.008
The type of synchronization we use for atomic

00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:07.070
sections is called mutual exclusion or lock. So this

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.010
is really an example of where a lock will

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.890
be needed. What we really need to do is

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.250
say something like, I'm entering, don't come in here.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.890
Then do this, then say, I'm leaving, now you

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.744
can come in. And when this one is done,

00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:25.150
this one can then say, I'm entering, I'm leaving.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.520
But if this thread comes and wants to

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.250
continue past this point while the first thread is

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.650
already in the critical section, we should wait here.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.914
So what we want here really is, before we

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:41.850
get into the critical section, qe need to lock,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.956
a lock. Let's call that count lock that corresponds

00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:47.658
to a given element of disarray. So count lock

00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:50.570
of L is a lock that corresponds to count

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.344
of L. If this lock currently is open, then

00:00:54.344 --> 00:00:57.646
we will enter. If this lock is currently locked,

00:00:57.646 --> 00:01:00.830
then we will spin there until it becomes open.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.379
Once we have grabbed the lock, we can enter here.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.830
The other thread will do the same. So the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.660
first one of them that succeeds in grabbing the lock

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.070
will enter this critical section. The other one will

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.210
now realize that this count lock has been locked and

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.870
will have to wait there. Once we leave

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.396
the critical section, we will unlock the lock. And

00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:24.442
now, if this one is waiting here at that

00:01:24.442 --> 00:01:26.674
point it sees that the lock is now available

00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:29.960
and starts executing the critical section, and then releases

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.280
the lock. Note that having the lock and unlock

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.880
enforces mutual exclusion of this code. We do this

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.560
alone. And we do this alone. But it doesn't

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.520
impose a particular order between them. So, whichever

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.590
of them comes first to this lock will

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.000
execute its critical section first. So we can

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.290
either have this happen first, and then this happen

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.330
second. Or we can have this happens first,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.980
and this happens second. What the lock is really

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.100
preventing is interleaving when these are happening simultaneously.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.980
But it doesn't prevent, for example, this second thread

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.729
doing this first and only then the first thread gets to do it.
