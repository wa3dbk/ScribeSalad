00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.121
Remember, we want to be able to go between decimals and percents. All right here

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:08.236
are some percents, and here are some decimals. For this quiz, I want you to fill

00:00:08.248 --> 00:00:12.170
in the boxes with the appropriate decimal or percent. You'll need to convert

00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:15.930
either to a decimal or to a percent. And again with the percent, don't worry

00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:19.889
about entering percent. I've already done it for you. Just enter the numbers.
