00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.590
Before we talk about how we can implement

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.740
RVM efficiently with a back to back DRAM. Let's

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.160
first understand how we can use a back

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.880
to back to DRAM to implement a persistent file

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.900
cache. What we mean by that is, typically

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.870
file systems use a file cache to hold data

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.750
that is brought from the disk for efficiency

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.590
of manipulation by programs or anything on the processor.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.420
And when we say it's a persistent file cache,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.170
what we're saying is, even if there is power failure,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.520
the contents of this file cache is still available when

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.620
the power comes back up again. And in order to

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.070
achieve that, what we're going to do is, we're going to

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.170
string a UPS power supply, to back this file cache,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.380
which is implemented in DRAM. So the contents of the

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.200
file cache never goes away. And we also postulate that,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.170
there is VM, a virtual memory protection. That

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.390
have been built in to the operating system to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.890
prevent operating system errors such as wild writes

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.610
to the file cache during software crash or power

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.630
failure. Now there are two ways to use

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.510
the Rio file cache. One is, when a process

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.052
does file writes, actually they are writing to the

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:16.480
in memory copy of the file. Typically operating system

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.030
buffers the rights that you do to files in DRAM and then write them out to the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.040
disk in opportune moments later on. And now if these file rights go to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.470
the file cache which is battery backed then you make sure that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.060
these file writes are persistent. Normally if an application wants

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.120
to make sure that when it writes a file, the contents of

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.850
the file is immediately forced disk, the application

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.860
will have to do an Fsync call in

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.700
a Unix system, for instance. But if we

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.440
have this battery-backed file cache, the application can simply

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.410
do normal file writes and don't worry about

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.340
doing an fsync, because writing to the file

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.180
writes to the file cache, and the file

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.020
cache is persistent by definition, because it is battery-backed.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.270
And similarly, another common operation that is done is Unix allows files to be

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.160
mmaped, that is mapped into memory. And if an application maps a file into

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.800
memory and writes to that file using

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.780
normal program writes, those normal program writes

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.730
become persistent because these rights are backed

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.850
by the file cache. And the file cache

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.320
is battery-backed, and therefore normal program writes

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.000
becomes persistent also. So with the Rio file

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.700
cache that is battery-backed, what we get is that file writes by a process as

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.670
well as normal program writes to memory

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.910
mapped files become persistent by definition. In the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.300
absence of this facility of a persistent

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.860
file cache. If an application were to mmap

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.170
a file, and write to that using normal program

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.380
rights, then it will have to do what is called

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.690
an msync call, in order to make sure that writes

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.360
that it did to virtual memory actually get persisted on

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.870
the disk. But with a file cache, real file

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.160
cache that is persistent, there is no need to do

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.980
that, because by definition, we are saying, any rights that

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.470
get into this file cache, will persist. In other words,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.250
the contents of the file cache, will survive

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.830
power failures. So if there is a system crash,

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.410
whether it is a power failure or software

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.300
crash, the file cache data, in memory, is going

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.020
to be written onto the disk for recovery.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.840
And so the upshot is no synchronous rights are

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.480
needed to the disk any more. It also means

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.120
that writeback of files written to by an application

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.632
can be arbitrarily delayed. What that means from the file

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:56.270
system perspective is that if the lifetime of files is

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.100
very short then those files go away. And so you

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.580
don't have to write it to the disk in the

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.140
first place. And this is common in compilation process for

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.280
instance a number of temporary files are created. And those

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.740
files live in the file cache for a short amount

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.310
of time and when the compilation process is complete, those files

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.100
are deleted so you never have to write those files to the disk. So that's a good

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.560
thing about having this idea of a persistent file

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.520
cache. Now let's look at how we can use

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.490
RIO to implement RVM. So we've got this persistent

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.990
file cache and we're going to ask the question,

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.440
if we have this persistent file cache, how can

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.640
we optimize the implementation of a reliable virtual memory?
