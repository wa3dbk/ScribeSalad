00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.450
The first thing to realize when
designing your application architecture,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.240
is that your phone typically has
a much more powerful processor, and

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.450
a much larger battery
than your wearable.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.350
You want to offload as much as
possible away from the wearable

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.520
to try to get the most
battery life out of it.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.040
Another key part of the application
architecture is that the phone

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.040
has direct access to the Internet,
while the wearable over here does not.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.560
So let's imagine a scenario where you'll
building an app to show weather updates

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.450
on a wearable.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.100
The phone will need to make
the request to fetch the data,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.030
and then send that to
the wearable via data relay API.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.980
There are many ways you
can implement this, but

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.060
if you do not design this
carefully it may perform poorly.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.670
So how do we implement
an efficient solution to this?

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.260
One of the first improvements comes
from changing how you wake up

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.370
the wearable device.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.950
Rather then having the wearable
wake up every 10 seconds or so,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.960
and request an update of
information from the phone,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.650
instead allow the phone to drive
updates to the wearable device.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.800
The simple action of keeping
the watch asleep as long as possible

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.640
will help conserve battery life.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.110
So once you've made the weather update
request from the phone to the internet,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.150
you may get back outdated information.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.380
An important step to do here is
to compare this with the previous

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.810
information downloaded earlier.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.440
If there's no change to the information,
you should not update the watch.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.960
There's no point waking it up just
to tell it that nothing has changed.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.920
We want the watch sleeping
as much as possible.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.440
If you have detected a change,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.080
it's important to minimize the amount of
data we actually send to the wearable.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.710
It would be a bad idea to send
the entire weather query result to

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.980
the wearable, since it probably
includes a lot of extra information,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.450
such as what you see here.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.840
Instead, we should pass
it on the phone and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.340
send just a single temperature value,
like this one here, to the wearable.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.340
Remember, we're trying to minimize the
amount of work done on the wearable, and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.020
even things that might seem
trivial will add up eventually.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.250
So how should we send
data to the wearable?

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.320
If you had to send a large
amount of temperature data for

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.640
a time range, it might be tempting
to create separate data items for

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.520
each time and temperature and
send them separately.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.670
However for each piece of data,
set between the phone and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.390
the wearable, there are overheads
added by the platform and the network.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.170
These overheads include headers for
packets, acknowledgments per packet, and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.320
energy required for every packet sent.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.520
As well as activating
the wireless hardware.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.780
When designing code to
send out over a network,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.380
taking these overheads into
consideration is important.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.430
So by storing many numeric values into
a single message, there'll be much less

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.310
data sent and processed,
than sending each one separately.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.770
The results can be quite considerable,
as you can see here.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.690
Once you've sent the item to the
wearable, you might be tempted to add

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.010
an acknowledgement to
check it was received.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.840
However, if you're using data items,
they are guaranteed by

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.810
the framework to be synchronized
when the wearable is paired up, so

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.120
you can be sure they'll
eventually be received.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.360
If you're using messages, then you will
need to check that they were received,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.930
since transmission is never guaranteed
if the device is disconnected, or

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.910
something else happens.
