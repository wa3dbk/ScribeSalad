00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Assertions in the code are there to stay.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We use them for catching errors, which we can also use during testing, but they also serve

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
as documentation tool for programmers because they show what the assumptions

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
of individual methods are and they show what the individual method is supposed to produce.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now let's apply assertions to another program, an old favorite of ours--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
our buggy HTML stripper from the first unit.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So here again we have the function to remove HTML markup,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which we already know from the first unit.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Here as well, a simple assertion would have sufficed to catch the error, mainly an assertion

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that checks for the non-existence of HTML tags in the output.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Such an assertion could be something like this--we simply check whether there is any less than sign

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that is the beginning of an HTML tag in the output.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We assume, there's none and if there would be one, then the assertion would immediately fail.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So here comes the quiz.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
With this assertion, which input would cause the assertion to raise an exception--

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is it foo in bold, is it foo in quotes and bold, is it foo in bold and quotes,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
or is it foo in bold and single quotes.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Which of these causes the assertion to fail? Over to you.
