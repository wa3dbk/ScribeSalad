We just plug these into our regression formula. Our predicted number of days

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:14.170
then will be 2.763 minus 0.149, times 5 plus 0.093 times 7, the self-esteem

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:23.467
score. We get about 2.7. So, we predict that a person with these scores would

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:28.040
have drunk alcohol almost three days in the last month.
