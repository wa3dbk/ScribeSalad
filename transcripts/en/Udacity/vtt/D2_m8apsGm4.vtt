00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.698
For this quadratic equation, it's best to factor. We know we can factor since

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:10.215
there are two factors that multiply to negative 12 and sum to negative 1. Those

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:14.490
factors are negative 4 and positive 3. So we can use these as coefficients to

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.590
rewrite the middle term, and then use factoring by grouping to continue to

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.676
solve. We set each factor equal to 0, so x could equal negative 1 or x could

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:29.340
equal positive 4 3rds. Amazing work if you found these two solutions.
