Acme supports vertical decomposition by allowing any component or

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.090
connector to be represented by one or more lower level views.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.820
Note that there are two things going on here. One is, levels of abstraction,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.190
that is a view can be at a lower level representation of something of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.270
a higher level. Also, is the fact that you can have multiple views of

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.300
the same higher level thing. Recall from our discussion of architectural views,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.420
that no single view is likely to provide all the information we need.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.650
And hence having multiple views, allows us to develop different representations,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.900
that can each add something to our understanding. Each view in your

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.670
Acme description is called a representation. Within representation there's

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.030
a mapping between levels called a rep-map, short for representation map
