00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.196
So, let's recap this section really quick. We can be exposed to stressors, and

00:00:04.196 --> 00:00:08.585
they can be both pleasant and unpleasant. Like a vactions or a marriage, or

00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:13.162
death of a loved one. And both stressors can produce negative emotional

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:17.676
responses. And sometimes, these negative emotional responses can be difficult

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:22.720
to control. And when we encounter a stressful situation, we engage in primary

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.184
appraisal, which is our first reaction or assessment of a situation. However,

00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:33.216
upon experiencing a negative emotional response produced by the stressful

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:39.000
event, we can also engage in secondary appraisal. Secondary appraisal is using

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.564
our self assessment and looking at the resources available to help us cope with

00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:47.340
this stressful event. By engaging in secondary appraisal, we may be able to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.162
reduce the level of negative emotions that we experience. So, in the shower

00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:55.660
handle example I showed you, it nicely demonstrates how I perceive the primary

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.084
event as very, very stressful. But upon my secondary appraisal, I was able to

00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:03.012
lower my stress levels, because I realized how happy I was that the handle

00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:08.078
didn't break off while the water was still running. I knew I really lucked out

00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:11.304
with that one. I also realized the things I needed to do to make the problem go

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:15.528
away, such as calling the plumber. And this a way of coping with the situation.

00:01:15.528 --> 00:01:19.615
So, this again demonstrates that it's a person's perceived ability to deal with

00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:23.641
a stressful event or stressor that results in a negative emotional response to

00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:28.466
stress. If however, I was a handy plumber myself and a shower came off, I

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:33.050
wouldn't perceive the event as stressful at all. I would just fix it myself,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.080
because I would have the skills I needed to solve the problem. Now, I might

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.676
still be a little stressed about the things I need to do to get the handle

00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:43.404
fixed, but not as much as I could be, because I figured out how I want to solve

00:01:43.404 --> 00:01:45.610
the problem.
