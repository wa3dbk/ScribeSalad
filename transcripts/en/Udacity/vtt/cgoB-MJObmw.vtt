00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.990
This is why for
most classification tasks

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.119
people tend to hold back more than
30,000 examples for validation.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.750
This makes accuracy figures significant
to the first decimal place and

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.370
gives you enough resolution
to see small improvements.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.360
If your classes are not well balanced,
for example,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.300
if some important classes are very rare,
this heuristic is no longer good.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.710
Bad news, you're only going
to need much more data.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.300
Now, holding back even 30,000 examples
can be a lot of data if you have

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.244
a small training set.

00:00:32.244 --> 00:00:35.280
Cross-validation, which
I've mentioned before,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.670
is one possible way to
mitigate the issue.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.810
But cross-validation
can be a slow process,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.370
so getting more data is
often the right solution.
