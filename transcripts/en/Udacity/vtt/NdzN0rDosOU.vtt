00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.020
So those are the participants.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.870
Now, let's talk for a minute about the review meeting itself.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.830
For a effective reviews, the review meeting should be itself, be structured.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.930
This includes the following steps.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.590
First off, introduce the participants to each other.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.810
They might not previously know each other.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.830
In particular, one effective strategy would be to

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.330
bring in a member of a different team.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.970
who's, you know, has a similar level of expertise, but to, to put a different

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.500
set of eyes that may not be biased by the you know, common understanding.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.090
Second, is a statement of objectives by the moderator.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.570
This is a reminder that the purpose of the meeting is to raise concerns over

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.210
specific artifacts.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.760
And not get diverted into problem-solving or, or other other issues.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.100
Third is an evaluation of the preparedness to determine whether

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.470
the meeting can go forward.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.480
This involves checking with the reviewers as to whether or not they had done

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.050
their preparation, and to collect their issues that they've already found.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.280
And also to check whether the artifact itself is ready for review.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.870
Next is the systematic review itself using some means of ensuring thoroughness,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.760
and we'll look at some of those in a minute.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.420
This is where the term walk-through is very important.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.210
The actual going through the artifact in a very systematic step by

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.930
step fashion to make sure the whole thing is covered.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.220
During this process it could be recording of results in

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.910
the form of the issues raised on the review form.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.410
After the systematic review, but still inside the meeting, there should be

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.430
some kind of summarization, often led by the recorder of the issues raised,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.870
including a determination of severities and priorities.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.400
Finally a determination of who is responsible for looking into these issues.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.220
In many cases it will be the author.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.790
But it may be that in certain cases somebody else gets assigned to do that.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.410
There should also be an agreement about how resolution will be verified.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.890
With respect to is it the moderator's responsibility?

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.530
The author's?

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.584
Or is there going to be a view review
