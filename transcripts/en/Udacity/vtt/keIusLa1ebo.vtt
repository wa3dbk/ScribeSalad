00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.735
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now it's your turn to try one totally on your own. Here's a quadratic

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:08.212
equation. Y equals the quantity 2x plus 1 times the quantity 3x minus 2. And I'd

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:12.112
like you to tell me where the parabola that corresponds to this equation

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:16.819
intersects the x-axis. Please make sure that whatever answers you give, whether

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:21.266
there's one or two or three or however many, should be written as points. So I

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:25.403
don't just want x values. I want the actual points of intersection.
