00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.990
Hi I'm Tucker.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.140
&gt;&gt; And I'm Dev.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.900
&gt;&gt; Welcome to this mini course,
Manipulating Financial Data in Python.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.410
Our goal is to give you
a quick introduction to

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.920
the skills you'll need to work
with financial data in Python.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.875
Now, some people complain
about our choice of Python for

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:21.020
financial applications.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.390
&gt;&gt; I don't agree with those people.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.590
Python allows you to quickly
prototype algorithms

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.350
while also providing
computational speed.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.420
It has a number of features.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.070
Firstly, it has strong
scientific libraries.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.230
Second, it is strongly maintained.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.330
It is also fast if you can stick to
metrics notation because lower levels

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.564
are returned in C.

00:00:44.564 --> 00:00:47.755
&gt;&gt; Some other potential languages
that might have made sense for

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:49.542
this course include R and MATLAB.

00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:54.160
Which are themselves also great
languages for financial data.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.100
But we've chosen Python and
we'll be using this book Python for

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.640
Finance in the course.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.740
Look for
readings assigned in the course outline.
