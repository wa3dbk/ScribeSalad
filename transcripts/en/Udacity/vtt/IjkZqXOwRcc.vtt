In the diagram, we have the master controller invoking the inputs and outputs.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.590
But the other communication is based upon more or

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.720
less a need to know when the output needs some value,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.770
to be produced it looks to it's source which is the alphabetic.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.520
Alphabetizer or the alphabetized shift component.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.010
And it looks to the circular shift component,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.250
which looks to the information that was stored during the parsing process.
