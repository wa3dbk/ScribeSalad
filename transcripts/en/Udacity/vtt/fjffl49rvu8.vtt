00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.990
In start ups there always seems to
be a tension between two paths.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.190
Distribution, give it for free and

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.145
capture a big chunk of the market, or
earnings, also known as making money.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.440
Charge for

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.940
your work but then you limit the
distribution to only paying customers.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.650
&gt;&gt; However, if you think on
your business plan in advance,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.160
there are many cases where
you can do both from

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.170
the beginning
&gt;&gt; A great strategy

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.570
will be to use the freemium model.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.760
You allow your users to use
the service for free and

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.180
then convert the power users
to a paying customers.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.250
Take for example a company
that does it very well, Wufoo.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.830
The free version let's you try
the product and see the value in it.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.670
They show you the benefits right there
on the first step of the registration.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.520
They focus on the most
important benefits.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.290
If you need to become a heavy user,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.960
in their case more than 100 reply
per month, they ask for payment.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.970
But at this point, you as the user
understand the work they did for

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.060
you, and it's valuable and
worth the price.
