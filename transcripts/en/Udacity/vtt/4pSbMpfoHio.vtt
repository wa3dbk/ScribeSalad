00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
I would like to do a little quiz with you here and have you tell me if I give this algorithm here

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.390
the best possible input, what it's running time will be and again I would like you to state that

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.520
the function of n, a and the constant and the same thing for the pessimistic view.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.670
If I give the algorithm the worst possible input that it can receive, what will be its running time.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.880
And I should also note that I haven't told you yet what the best and worst possible input

00:00:28.880 --> 99:59:59.000
for the algorithm will be but I'll have you figure that out.
