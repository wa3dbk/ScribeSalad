00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.520
So let's say you found a font
that looks great on a bunch of

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.870
different screen resolutions and
different sizes, and even better,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.870
it doesn't detract from
the overall theme of your app.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.250
How would you use it?

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.650
So here's a small app that I
did to show you the different

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.790
typographical sizes that are available
in Android and their names.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.280
Now, right now they're all
using the Roboto font.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.220
Let's go and change that.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.870
So here's the app that
we were just looking at.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.020
So if you want to add your own font,
the first thing that you will need to do

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.560
is add an assets directory
under source main.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.220
And we've included our font,
which is Courgette-Regular.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.720
It was just a font that I
found on Google web fonts,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.520
because most of them are available
with open source licenses.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.550
So if we switch over to the Android
view, it will show up as assets and

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.140
resurrectory.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.050
But those are the same location,
so you might see one or

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.670
the other depending on how you
set up your Android Studio.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.664
If you're using your font inside
a fragment, due to the fragment life

00:01:10.664 --> 00:01:16.300
cycle, you need to instantiate
the type face in the onAttach method.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.450
The reason for
this is there's a short period of time

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.690
after a fragment is created, but
before it's attached to a host activity.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.560
So, if you can see in this
Typeface.createFromAsset function,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.820
we have getActivity and then getAssets.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.340
If this is called before it's
attached to the activity,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.320
it will result in an error.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.810
So, if we go to our onCreate method,
after instantiating our text views,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.860
we just call the setTypeface function
with the object that we just created.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.300
So if we look at this on a device,
we can see that our display4 and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.830
our headlineView have changed.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.100
So this is our display4 here, and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.040
then if we scroll up a bit,
right here is our headline.
