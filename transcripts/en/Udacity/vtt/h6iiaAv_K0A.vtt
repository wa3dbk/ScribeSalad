00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is the value of k0 is meaningless as long as we have a good random

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
distribution here when we raise a to the e power and the reason for that is

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
this value now v would be x1 + r to the e mod n that is because xb is x1.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The value for k0 is that minus x0 raised to the d power modn.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There’s nothing that gets rid of this random value and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
there’s no reason this would be a meaningful value.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The value of k1 though is meaningful, and it's in fact the value of r, and the reason for that

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
now the value of k1 is equal to the value of v minus x1 so that removes the x1 from that value.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So that means the value of k is r to the e modn raised to the d power modn

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and this is exactly the RSA decryption that will give us the value of the message

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which in this case is equal to r.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That means Alice has now learned that random r is selected by Bob,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and if value is stored in one of these keys, she doesn't know which one,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the value of k0 is meaningless.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It’s a meaningless value that can’t be determined by Bob

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
because Bob doesn’t know the value of d.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
That’s the important thing that we’ve done here.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now, Alice has these two keys.

00:01:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Depending on what value Bob picked, one of them is meaningful, has the value r, the other one is not.
