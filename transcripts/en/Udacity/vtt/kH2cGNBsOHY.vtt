00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.909
Negative 1 is greater than negative 2, so we need a greater than sign. Let's

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.824
look at the two number lines for these two inequalities. Let's say that this

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:11.831
time, I want to see if the 2's are correct in relation to the 1's. So, I'm going

00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:15.855
to draw these number lines from the perspective of the number 1's. So, I want to

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.724
know if 2 is greater than 1. That means it should fall in the category of all

00:00:19.724 --> 00:00:24.305
numbers that are greater than 1. Start at 1 I need to shade to the right. Sure

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:28.778
enough here's 2, smack dab in the middle of that range, well not in the middle

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:33.123
but in it and that's all that matters. Now we want to know if negative 2 is in

00:00:33.123 --> 00:00:37.483
fact in the range of numbers that are less than negative 1. Let's go over to

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:42.019
negative 1 and shade to the left of negative 1. And once again we have negative

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.468
2 as part of that interval. Awesome. Comparing these 2 number lines, looks like

00:00:46.468 --> 00:00:50.628
we have pretty much exactly the same thing, except that the intervals here are

00:00:50.628 --> 00:00:54.923
fractions of one another across the 0 mark. So if I match the 2 of them together

00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:59.077
on 1 number line, can see that we have the exact same thing to the right of the

00:00:59.077 --> 00:01:03.252
0 as we have to the left of the 0, just inverted. This is pretty cool. So,

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:07.608
dividing by negative 1 is just like flipping everything to the opposite side of

00:01:07.608 --> 00:01:11.766
the number line. So, when we divided by negative 1, we flipped our point of

00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:16.054
reference across the 0, the same distance away to the other side of the number

00:01:16.054 --> 00:01:20.312
line. And that's why we had to switch our sign, so that it faced the opposite

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:24.156
direction as well. The two numbers now have the opposite relationship. Since

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:27.318
being further away from zero than another number on the positive end of the

00:01:27.318 --> 00:01:30.637
number line means that you're greater than that other number. Whereas being

00:01:30.637 --> 00:01:33.901
further from zero than another number on the other end of the number line; the

00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:36.555
negative side means that you're less than that other number.
