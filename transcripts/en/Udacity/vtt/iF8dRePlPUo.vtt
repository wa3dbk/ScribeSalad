00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.650
Welcome to this deep learning lecture.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.870
My name is Vincent, and I'm a research
scientist at Google working on machine

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.510
learning and artificial intelligence.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.800
Deep learning is an exciting branch
of machine learning that uses data,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.860
lots of data,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.930
to teach computers how to do things
only humans were capable of before.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.780
Myself, I am very interested in
solving the problem of perception.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.080
Recognizing what's in an image, what
people are saying when they are talking

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.320
on their phone, helping robots explore
the world and interact with it.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.775
Deep learning is emerge as a central
tool to solve perception problems

00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:32.320
in recent years.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.530
It's the state of the art having
to do with computer vision and

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.070
speech recognition.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.350
But there's more.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.180
Increasingly, people are finding
that deep learning is a much better

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.090
tool to solve problems like discovering
new medicines, understanding natural

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.930
language, understanding documents, and
for example, ranking them for search.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.200
So let's take a look at what
you'll be doing during this class.
