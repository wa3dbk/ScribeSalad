00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.170
So far, in this course, we have considered software architectures.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.310
Today, I would like to get into one particular kind of software architecture,

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.540
the architecture for distributed systems. And all this means is there's multiple

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.271
computers involved in providing whatever application technology system it's

00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:28.790
supposed to. Moreover, we will consider heterogeneous distributed systems.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.420
Systems in which the different computers are different kinds and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.340
provide different capabilities. An example of this is a typical client server

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.080
system for example, insurance agents go out into the field,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.480
they come to your house, they talk to you about various insurance options, and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.570
they have their laptops. The laptops are connected to some server machine that,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.440
understands the different forms you have to fill out, and the and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.020
the rates involved in those in those particular contracts. And

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.280
ultimately if you sign up for a particular policy then the business

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.730
logic connects to a data base that stores the information about you and

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.720
your particular policy arrangements. In that particular situation,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.710
there was a a database server machine, there was a web server

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.490
that was responsible for initiating and computing business logic.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.520
And there were various web browsers running on laptop machines,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.900
one for each agent. We'd like to look a little bit more in

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.500
how these particular kinds of systems are architected.
