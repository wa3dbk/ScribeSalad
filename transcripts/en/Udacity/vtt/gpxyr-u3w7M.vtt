00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.600
Part of the fun in creating a 2D game
is designing the game world and levels.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.120
You can be as creative as you want here,
and

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.000
come up with something completely new,
or

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.740
take inspiration from an historical
great, an homage to the bit glory days.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.900
Whatever your game world looks like or
how it behaves, for all but

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.360
the most basic games you're going to
need a way to define, and save and

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.401
restore, level layout and features.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.220
And first, this might be done statically
in code, you just hard code paths and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.570
obstacles, and I'm using powerups.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.130
But eventually you'll find keeping
level data separate from game code,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.240
really simplifies level design and
programming.

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:40.205
It's a good idea to store level data in
simple text files during development.

00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:43.265
Whether comma-separated values,
YAML, JSON, XML,

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:47.473
it doesn't really matter as long as
the data is generally human-readable and

00:00:47.473 --> 00:00:48.891
you can edit it directly.

00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:51.225
It doesn't even have to be text.

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:54.055
An image bitmap is another
flexible way to define levels, and

00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:56.650
it's easy to edit with
standard drawing tools.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.350
We'll explore this
more a little later on.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.210
The format you choose will usually be
a function of which parsers are readily

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.380
available in your game framework or
programming language of choice.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.000
There will probably be several options,
so

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.760
you can pick the one you're
most comfortable with.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.970
For production,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.840
many game developers convert text
format level files to binary.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.520
In part to reduce their size and

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.780
sometimes to make the data harder
to reverse engineer or hack.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.250
Even if you don't do this though,
pushing level data into external files

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.390
is highly recommended and
makes it much easier to work with.
