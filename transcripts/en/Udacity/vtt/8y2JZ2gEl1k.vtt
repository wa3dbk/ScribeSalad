00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.240
Welcome to elementary statistics.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.000
We're really excited
to have you on board.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.630
My name's Katie, and

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.230
I'm the one who'll be explaining most
of the concepts throughout this course.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.580
I'll also be doing a lot of drawing and

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.270
a lot of writing to help you understand
the content as much as possible.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.640
In each of the 16
lessons in this course,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.910
you'll learn new methods to describe and
analyze data.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.570
Each lesson builds on
the concepts you learned before.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.520
So as you progress through the course
try to get a good grasp of the material

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.190
before moving on.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.190
But if it turns out you need a review,
no big deal.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.840
You can easily go back and re-watch
the videos and redo the exercises.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.110
What do I mean by exercises?

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.050
Each lesson consists of
short instructional videos

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.440
where I explain cool step stuff and
guide your thinking.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.780
But we want you to make
breakthroughs on your own.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.340
So instead of just telling you a fact or
formula, I'll ask a quiz.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.300
A quiz or exercise,
same thing, is not there for

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.760
us to judge you or to impact your grade.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.800
It's there for your own benefit,
to make you think.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.330
At Udacity, we believe that the chance
to think about something from your

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.400
own unique perspective is
a powerful learning opportunity.
