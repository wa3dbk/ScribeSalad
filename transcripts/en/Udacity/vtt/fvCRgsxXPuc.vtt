00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.451
Now there's one more error in this code, but it's tricky to catch and it's

00:00:04.463 --> 00:00:09.523
tricky because, the JavaScript engine of most browsers won't catch it either.

00:00:09.595 --> 00:00:13.485
Let's take a look at that for a second. Now, if you go back up to the top here,

00:00:13.588 --> 00:00:18.297
you might notice that there's no semi-colon at the end of this ent.update

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:23.259
statement. Technically, JavaScript requires semi-colons here, but the

00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:28.271
javascript engines in most browsers will actually fix this for you.

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:32.839
That is, JavaScript is designed so that when it encounters an error, it will

00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:38.098
automatically insert a semicolon in an attempt to fix that error.

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:43.040
In this case, it would fix it just fine: the JavaScript engine would continue executing your

00:00:43.052 --> 00:00:47.185
code as if nothing had happened. Don't rely on this though, this can get you

00:00:47.197 --> 00:00:51.390
into problems, for example: this is a single line if statement. Let's say we

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:55.340
didn't bother with these braces here, and now let's say there's an error

00:00:55.352 --> 00:00:59.885
somewhere in this code so that the JavaScript engine automatically inserted a

00:00:59.897 --> 00:01:04.315
semicolon. Well, if it inserted a semicolon right here, then this would be

00:01:04.327 --> 00:01:08.980
interpreted as an empty if block, so this statement below would actually not be

00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:13.410
part of the if statement, and would get called all the time, which probably

00:01:13.422 --> 00:01:17.515
isn't what you want to happen. Be careful about this, make sure

00:01:17.527 --> 00:01:20.619
to add semicolons at the end of your statements.
