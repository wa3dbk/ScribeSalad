I'm Brenna. I am Udacity's Community Manager. So I work with our students to

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.420
tell everyone about our classes, and support

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.750
everyone and celebrate our successes. I have

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.883
an Android. It's pretty [SOUND] janky. It's

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:18.270
old, [SOUND] and it loses power almost

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.645
immediately if you turn the Internet on. So, I'm offline most of the time.

00:00:23.645 --> 00:00:25.970
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.140
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.050
so if I'm lost, I will turn on the internet and I will go on to Google

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.500
Maps and if I really want to check my e-mail I'll turn it on by you know, it's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.945
a, it's a big decision. Probably my favorite app is

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:46.890
2048. We recently had a class called make your

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.080
own 2048 and I along with pretty much everyone in the office got addicted

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.160
to playing 2048. So I'll probably spend like

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.270
hours and hours playing 2048 on my phone. [LAUGH]

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.850
That was definitely worth losing battery. The last

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.950
app I uninstalled was Twitter because when I turn

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.660
the Internet on with my phone Twitter is a total energy hog and will not let any

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.790
other app do anything until it's updated like

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.140
all 80 million tweets that Udacity's gotten in the

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.290
meantime, and so it literally kills my phone. So

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.290
I had to take it off. I install it every

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.890
now and then if I need to tweet from my

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.390
phone, but in general, I can tweet from other devices.
