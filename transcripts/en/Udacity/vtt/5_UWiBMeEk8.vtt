00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A sensible estimate would be E times the ratio of the first to the difference.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's look at why that is the case.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We know that for the forward Euler's method, the global truncation error that this kind of error

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
depends on the step size in almost the linear fashion.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This error that I am looking for here is the GTE for h1.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We see that E, the error between the two numerical solutions, appears here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So now there's two similar triangles. The first one is here and the second one is here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's look at the following ratio error/h1. This has to equal E/h2-h1,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and hence, the error is equal to E*h1 times up divided by the difference.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm writing an equal sign here but of course that's just a rough estimate.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This dependance is not strictly linear and we're assuming

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that these three points are almost on a line.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This may not be perfect in practice.
