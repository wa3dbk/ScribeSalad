00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.497
Let's do one more example of where we would use a confidence interval before we

00:00:04.497 --> 00:00:09.240
move on. Well, hopefully you're enjoying the class so far. How would we measure

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.576
this? Maybe one way is to look at the number of minutes that each person has

00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:18.593
watched of the videos. Divided by the total minutes that are available we could

00:00:18.593 --> 00:00:22.871
call this something like the engagement ratio because this provides some

00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:27.825
indication of how engaged you are. If you're watching more video then you are

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:32.973
probably more engaged. As of March 11th, when I'm recording this, there are

00:00:32.973 --> 00:00:39.188
8,702 students enrolled in the course. I made up this hypothetical data set the

00:00:39.188 --> 00:00:44.204
link is below, unfortunately I couldn't get the actual data for every student,

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:48.830
but I think the shape is pretty close to what it really is. And that's just the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.806
nature of the mook. A lot of people sign up because it's free and easy, but they

00:00:52.806 --> 00:00:56.712
don't progress through the course or they just sign up with the intention of

00:00:56.712 --> 00:01:01.965
doing it later. However if you're taking the course for credit, which I think

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:06.255
about a hundred of you are, you're probably up here on the distribution, making

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:10.800
your way through the course to get credit for it. So first of all, calculate the

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.281
mean and standard deviation for this data. This is a pretty big data set, so try

00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:19.955
to make use of the keyboard shortcuts that you've learned before. Treat this as

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:25.353
a population and round to the nearest thousandths or three decimal places.
