00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.152
Here are three graphs, which I've labeled a, b, and c. And I'd like you to tell

00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:09.892
me which one fits the statement we chose in the last question. The larger the

00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:15.167
panda population, the more pandas die each year. And the smaller the

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:19.081
population, the fewer die.
