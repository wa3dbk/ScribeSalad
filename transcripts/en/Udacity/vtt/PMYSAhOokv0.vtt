00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
We have a number of statements here, and for each of those statements,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.460
I would like you to tell me two things.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.270
The first one is if the statement is correct and the second one is if the upper bound I'm giving you

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.780
on the right side here is the best possible bound or the tightest bound that you can find.

00:00:19.780 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check all of the boxes that you think are correct.
