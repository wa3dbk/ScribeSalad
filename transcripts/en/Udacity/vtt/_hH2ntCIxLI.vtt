00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.160
The solution is to lauch 
an explicit intent

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.660
to the Detail Activity Class. 
We'll go to On Create View,

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.380
where our On Item 
click listener is defined.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.300
To pass in the Weather Forecast 
information, we can use

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.840
an intent extra, 
which is a key value pair

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.030
in the Intent.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.790
We use the key name, 
Intent.extratext,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.800
but we can use any string for the key,
as long as we use the same key

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.460
when reading the information out.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.310
Just as in the toast, 
we obtain the forecast data

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.000
from the current list item 
by calling get item

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.560
on the adapter at the given position. 
Once we've added the intent,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.350
we just start the activity.
