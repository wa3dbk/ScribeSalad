00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.602
Let's do one final factoring by grouping example together. How would you factor

00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:08.884
x cubed plus 4 x squared minus x minus 4? Now, this one is definitely a little

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:13.325
bit slippery. Think really critically as you're going through the problem and

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:17.613
double-check at the end that there are no fractable expressions left in your

00:00:17.613 --> 00:00:19.114
final answer. Good luck.
