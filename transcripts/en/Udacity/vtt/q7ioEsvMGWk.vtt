We start with a rectangle. One side will be 2b minus 5c. And then this other

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:12.037
side will be 9b plus 4c. Multiplying the first two terms together, we get 18b

00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:18.601
squared. Multiplying 2b times 4c, I get 8bc. Next, we distribute the negative 5c

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:25.216
to 9b. Negative 5c times 9b is negative 45bc. And finally, we multiply negative

00:00:25.216 --> 00:00:31.759
5c times 4c to get negative 20c squared. We combine like terms, and we get 18b

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.625
squared minus 37 times bc minus 20c squared.
