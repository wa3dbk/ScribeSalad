So if metacognition reasons over deliberation, could we also have

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.800
an additional layer, where meta-metacognition reasons over metacognition? And

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.367
to take that even further, could we have a meta-meta-metacognition reasons over

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:14.920
meta-metacognition all the way up, infinitely up in a hierarchy?

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.200
Is this a good way to think about the levels of metacognition?
