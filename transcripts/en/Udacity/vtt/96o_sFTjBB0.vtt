Just as you can create a reflection vector to perform reflection mapping, you

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.042
can also create a refraction vector, and use that instead to access the

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:09.900
environment map. This can be combined with the color of the object to get

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.562
different variation of a material that looks a fair bit like glass. Snell's

00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:17.843
Law's what's normally used for computing the refraction direction. It's named

00:00:17.843 --> 00:00:20.992
after Willebrord Snellius, a Dutch astronomer and mathematician from the 17th

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:25.338
century. However, it turns out that Ibn Sahl, a Persian mathematician,

00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:30.616
discovered this back in 984 A.D. This is an old formula and is as follows. In

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:33.196
this diagram, we have a ray of light traveling through, say, the air, and

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:37.958
hitting a transparent object, say, made of glass. In this equation, N1 and N2

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:42.000
are the index refraction of the air and glass respectively. The index of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.038
refraction is a physical value for a material that is essentially how much

00:00:45.038 --> 00:00:49.661
slower light travels through it compared to light in a vacuum. As examples,

00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:53.872
here are some indexes of refraction. Air is just about 1, it's very close to

00:00:53.872 --> 00:00:57.904
vacuum. Diamond is very different than glass and so that's one thing that

00:00:57.904 --> 00:01:01.940
differentiates them. When the index of the refraction of the second material is

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.819
greater than the first the effect is that the sine of the angle must be smaller

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.932
to compensate. This means the angle from the normal becomes smaller. In other

00:01:09.932 --> 00:01:14.275
words, light bends towards the normal when going from air to glass. The effect

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:17.985
is reversed when going in the other direction. Going from glass to air causes

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:22.292
the light to bend at a greater angle. This is what refraction mapping does. It

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:25.790
changes the direction of the light passing through the transparent object.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.606
However, real objects have at least two refraction events when light passes

00:01:28.606 --> 00:01:32.730
through them, both when entering and exiting the surface. Refraction mapping

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.503
does just the one refraction. Refraction mapping is not quite as convincing as

00:01:36.503 --> 00:01:40.174
reflection mapping, in my opinion. Part of the reason is that the distortions

00:01:40.174 --> 00:01:43.832
produced are not as complex as the real thing. More importantly, all that you

00:01:43.832 --> 00:01:47.353
can ever see through these transparent objects is the environment map. Nothing

00:01:47.353 --> 00:01:50.588
else. Notice that with the spheres demo, lovely as it is, that you can't see

00:01:50.588 --> 00:01:54.320
any spheres through any other spheres. It's possible to make this happen, but

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.170
it is a lot of extra computation.
