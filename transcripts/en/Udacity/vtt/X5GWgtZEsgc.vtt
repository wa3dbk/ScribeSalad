00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.563
There are two ways you can figure out what this z-critical value is. One is to

00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:11.695
look at the z table and find the value for which 2.5% is less than that. So, if

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:18.374
we look for 0.025, or 2.5%, we see that it's here at negative 1.96. So, that

00:00:18.374 --> 00:00:25.619
means that this z-critical value is negative1.96 because 2.5% is less than

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.940
that. And since this distribution is symmetrical, that means that this

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.890
z-critical value would be positive 1.96. Another thing you could have done is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.182
noted that if 2.5% is up here in the blue region, then 97.5% is below the

00:00:42.182 --> 00:00:50.950
z-critical value. Then, you could have looked for 0.975 in the z-table and then

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.679
you would get positive 1.96. This is called the two tailed test. When we split

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.630
the alpha level in half, we see that its two tailed. And then our z-critical

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.903
values become both the positive and negative of the same number.
