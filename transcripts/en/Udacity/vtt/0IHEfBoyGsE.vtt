00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, now for the answer--the issue with html input of course,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is that it contains confidential information.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We really don't want the entire world to know who we are

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and which websites we visit.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So, we have seen that there is indeed confidential information in here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If we center out this data in order to reproduce the bug,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
this means that the sensitive data may be out of control.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This means that developers may get access to it

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
with plenty of possible issues that follow.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There are multiple solutions to that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
First to keep the data secret, for instance you could sign

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a nondisclosure agreement with your customer

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
before you ever get access to such data.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The second option is simply to anonymize the data.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That is, you produce a version of the data

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
with the sensitive information removed.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You can also use a technique like Delta Debugging

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to simply file the input automatically

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and to keep only those characters that are actually required to reproduce the failure.
