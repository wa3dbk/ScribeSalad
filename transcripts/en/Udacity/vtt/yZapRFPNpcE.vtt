00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.586
So let's start with a warm-up activity to create

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:07.724
concepts for more, and less. We'll actually use these later

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:11.126
as they're central to the conceptual model of the

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:13.853
Time Bank. With the Time Bank, when we do tasks

00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:16.840
for someone, we get more time in our account.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.100
And after someone does a task for us, when we

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.356
pay them, we get less time in our account. So

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.560
let's follow along with the students. So we're going to do

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.120
a very quick exercise. Get a new big piece of paper. Some of the things you need

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.820
to communicate in your wallet are conceptual models of more or less.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.708
All right, so we're going to take a few minutes and you're going to do ten

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:48.700
conceptual models of how you can show, how you can depict more or less/
