One more thing before we get back
to computational computer vision.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.320
When we talk about
the color space of devices

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.250
actually when we talk about the color
space of devices, what we're usually

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.970
talking about is what's referred
to as the color gamut, okay?

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.840
And color gamuts are just
subsets of possible colors.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.330
And here I'm showing you
three different color gamuts

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.960
that have been measured or that
are just defined in a particular way.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.310
So you see this first one?

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.650
Alright, this is the 1931, that's that
Chromaticity Diagram I was telling you

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.450
about, and the, and this big
that's all the colors you can see.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.640
Notice that on the inside,
is this triangle that is

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.930
a tremendous subset of that possible
set and you see it says HDTV.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.700
Turns out these are all
the colors that HDTV can make.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.300
So if you wanted to make this
really nice lush deep green,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.600
HDTV can't do it because of the way
it defines its color space.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.970
All right?

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.350
Any photographers out there?

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.960
I hope so.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.810
If you use Photoshop or any other
photographic manipulations systems

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.510
that understand color spaces, they'll
tell you that you can have it in a color

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.110
space of sRGB or
Adobe RGB or ProPhoto RGB.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.650
These are different sized color spaces,
and

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.205
you know one of them is
really small it's this sRGB.

00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:31.240
Okay, why do people use that one so
much?

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.260
That's the color space that most color
monitors used to be able to support.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.160
Okay.
And so,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.160
if you were displaying something,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.580
say on the web,
you don't want to have these colors out

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.060
here because they're not going to
show up the right way on a monitor.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.240
So when you try to do color balancing
sometimes you have to map colors that

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.380
are distributed out throughout all of
color space onto a smaller color space.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.920
That's particularly true
when you print things.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.600
Here is a, some gamut comparisons of so
again the, the big one

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.340
is all of human vision, the white one is
this Adobe RGB we were talking about.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.669
Notice the green one.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.800
The green one it says
Epson 2200 Premium Luster.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.850
That's the color gamut of one particular
printer on one particular paper, okay.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.650
That's the set of colors
that that printer can make.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.490
So if you have a color out
here it won't work very well.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.760
Likewise down there.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.590
I learned this the hard way when I
first got into digital photography.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.250
My daughter at the time was about 11
years old was wearing this really kind

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.190
of dark blue shiny, royal blue dress and
I printed it on a HP printer,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.070
not a great printer but not
a terrible printer and it was purple.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.950
And what was annoying to me
to begin with is the color of

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.990
a bunch of other things were perfect.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.580
So why, you know, because I understood
color balance, you know, maybe I had

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.650
a wrong color, no, you know, my,
my son's gray thing was nice and gray.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.510
It didn't, it didn't shift blue or red.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.700
But her pur,
her blue thing was looking purple.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.010
The reason was is that is was outside
the color gamut of the printer.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.460
All right?

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.140
And I've subsequently paid a lot of
money to get a much better printer
