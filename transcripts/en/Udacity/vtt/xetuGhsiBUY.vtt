At Udacity sometimes we have a little bit too much fun making memes.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.810
In fact I just searched for

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.730
meme and all of these plus a lot more showed up in my inbox.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.560
We apparently send these out all the time.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.670
In fact one time James even sent out an entire email about

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.130
the programming language Swift using Taylor Swift memes.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.470
So we, yeah, probably have too much fun.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.330
I hear this one came out of web performance because I'm

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.920
making kind of a funny face.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.240
No idea where this one came from but

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.490
that's Jared who makes classes at Georgia Tech.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.450
This is Ben who's favorite thing in the world is to make Chrome extensions.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.420
In fact, it comes up in almost every conversation about some type of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.645
new technology.

00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:42.900
Ben'll be like, hey, I could make a Chrome extension for that.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.330
So of course, I had to make a meme about him.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.380
But I think my all-time favorite meme in my inbox is this one.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.280
To give you a little bit of background we have Fancy Friday every other Friday,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.820
where instead of trying to dress up like normal tech workers, who are always

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.940
wearing jeans and T-shirts, we try to put on something different, you know?

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.490
Wear something nice.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.380
And this is David in the background here.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.000
And I don't know what's going on here.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.730
Apparently this is fancy.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.500
But who knows?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.310
So I've gone ahead and shown you some of our favorite memes.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.810
But now we want to know what your favorite meme is.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.500
Go ahead hop on the forums and post your favorite safe for work memes.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.360
When you're done check this box to keep going.
