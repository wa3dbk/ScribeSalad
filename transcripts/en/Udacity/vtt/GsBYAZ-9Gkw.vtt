00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.590
Let me give you an example of how your time bank

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.430
might work. Let's say, I'm looking for someone to fix my

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.390
bike. Well, by teaching design to other time bank members, I've

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.400
accumulated a credit of hours. I look, and I find Jane, who

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.390
is an excellent bike repair person, and I invite her to

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.890
my project. We agree on the job. The work is completed

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.200
and the bike is now running great. And so, we make

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.140
the transfer of hours which have been deducted from my account and

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.820
added to Jane's.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.560
I'll bet some of you are already thinking

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.070
about how this works as a system. Well, there's

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.620
my screen, and then there's Jane's screen. And then,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.170
there's some administrator at the bank. Even though this

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.520
is a more complex system. For this project, to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.360
make it simple, we're just going to focus on a

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.240
single person's user interface and experience. What your screens

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.040
would look like, if you were using the bank.
