00:00:04.778 --> 00:00:06.378
It worked.

00:00:06.378 --> 00:00:07.650
&gt;&gt; What worked?

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.900
&gt;&gt; My web app.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.830
I just got my database working, and
I just posted my first picture.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.480
&gt;&gt; Awesome, can I see?

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.680
Whoa, that looks pretty cool.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm super excited.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.870
But, most of my friends are using their
phones to view my web app, and so

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.480
I was thinking maybe I want to
make a Project COMPASS mobile app.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.170
&gt;&gt; Well, it sounds like your next step
is to get into mobile programming.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.150
By 2020, there will be over
6.1 billion smartphone users.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.710
The majority of the world will have
access to the web through their

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.960
mobile phone.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.760
That means there's a huge demand for
mobile programmers.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.450
Specifically iOS programmers and
Android programmers.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.250
What's different about mobile
programmers is that they work closely

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.870
with the actual hardware
of mobile phones.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.450
Many mobile apps like Snapchat use
hardware features such as mobile

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.580
cameras.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.016
Let's take a look at what
types of problems and

00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:59.087
projects mobile programmers work on.

00:00:59.087 --> 00:01:03.129
Mobile developers work on projects
such as building apps that

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.590
are responsive on different devices.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.170
Creating apps with
a clean user interface so

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.030
that it's intuitive and easy to use.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.780
Syncing apps to servers so
that it can present data to a user.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.070
Taking apps from a functional state to a
production ready state through handling

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.560
cases, accessibility features,
localization widgets, and libraries.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.340
Building high performance apps by taking
advantage of mobile device hardware

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.860
such as cameras and microphones.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.720
The Medium app is a great example
of a well designed mobile app.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.030
It's responsive to
different screen sizes and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.470
there's a clean user interface.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.980
It also syncs with different servers to
get data from websites like Twitter and

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.760
other new services.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.180
It also takes advantage of mobile
device hardware such as the camera, so

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.160
that users can take pictures and
post them to their Medium blog.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.450
As of July 2015 there are over
3 million mobile apps.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.400
Whether you decide to build an iOS or

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.979
an Android app, mobile applications
create a multibillion dollar industry.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.200
Let's chat with Sydney about her
experiences as an iOS developer.
