00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.546
We want to take the square root of both sides of the equation. We want to make

00:00:03.546 --> 00:00:07.175
sure that at least one of those sides has a plus or minus next to it. Since the

00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:11.094
left side doesn't, the right side needs it. So that rules out all of our answers

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:14.757
that don't have plus or minus symbols in front of them. This first answer is

00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:18.837
definitely correct because it has a square root sign over the entire expression,

00:00:18.837 --> 00:00:22.869
those on the right hand side originally. However, when we have a square root

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.017
over a fraction. This is the same as taking the square root of the numerator

00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:31.395
over the square root of the denominator. So this choice is correct as well. If

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:35.883
we simplify that denominator, square root of 4a squared, that just gives us 2a,

00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:40.187
so the last choice is also correct. There's so many different ways of writing

00:00:40.187 --> 00:00:44.347
this, however I think that this last one is probably the most simple, since it

00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:46.330
has the fewest radicals involved.
