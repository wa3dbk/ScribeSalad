00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.396
Now back when the Nintendo 64 was still in prototype, the execs over at

00:00:03.396 --> 00:00:07.463
Nintendo did a little bit of tricky marketing. They brought in a bunch of

00:00:07.463 --> 00:00:10.258
reporters, put them in a room, they pretty much had a screen rendering a little

00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:14.444
character on it, and a little interesting black box in front of them. Now the

00:00:14.444 --> 00:00:17.575
black box was completely hidden. All the reporters could do was stick their

00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:20.573
hands inside and fumble around with the controller that was in it. After a

00:00:20.573 --> 00:00:23.647
while of playing with these things, one of the reporters said that the

00:00:23.647 --> 00:00:27.251
controllers were so revolutionary, it was like his thoughts were being extended

00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:32.272
right into the game, which is a great case and point. If you get the controls

00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:35.714
right, the world plays along with you. Get it wrong and, well I'm pretty sure

00:00:35.714 --> 00:00:37.480
you can guess what happens then.
