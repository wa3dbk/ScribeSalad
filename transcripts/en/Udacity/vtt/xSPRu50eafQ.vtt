00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.142
Alright so this is fairly straightforward. And you might remember it actually

00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:07.854
from unit two where we had to deal with intersecting rects with the view rects

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:12.810
and the canvas styles. So to do this we simply take each rectangle and compare

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.264
the left most and right most edges of both. And see if they overlap and do the

00:00:17.264 --> 00:00:21.413
same with the top and the bottom of each rectangle. After that, we return a

00:00:21.413 --> 00:00:23.350
Boolean based on it and we're done.
