00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.086
Here's the starter code that we were given. We were already given the

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:07.890
declaration, for this variable, but we still have to initialize it. And down

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.950
here is, the loop, that we've had at the beginning of this lesson, that

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.551
arranges, all of the pictures. This time, all of the pictures inside matches,

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:22.868
so that they appear side by side. Our job is, to fill up, the ArrayList

00:00:22.868 --> 00:00:29.360
matches. We need to initialize the variable, and here is the expression. We

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.970
called the new operator, because we want to have a new object and the type of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.064
the object is ArrayList off the picture. The parenthesis here, again, just

00:00:37.064 --> 00:00:42.720
means that we call the construct. Next, we loop through all of the pictures in

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.514
the original array list. For each one we decide whether it's a match. And so we

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:53.136
added to this ArrayList, that's all. As it happens with this set of pictures

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:57.628
there are two matches. Those of them are displayed here. Now you've seen quite

00:00:57.628 --> 00:01:00.841
a few useful algorithms, but maybe you're getting a bit tired of our galleries

00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:05.989
here. Go ahead and practice them with Sara in a different context.
