00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.135
So now let's try it.

00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:06.482
The first thing you should do is copy this code into your own IDE and run it and confirm that it works.

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:10.947
And then as a quiz what I'd like you to do is change this program in two ways.

00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:13.982
First, instead of processing an array of 64 elements,

00:00:13.982 --> 00:00:16.686
let's process an array of 96 elements.

00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:19.333
Don't forget to change the allocation if necessary.

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:24.166
Second, instead of computing the square of each element in the array let's compute its cube.
