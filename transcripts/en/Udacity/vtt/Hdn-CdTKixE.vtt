00:00:00.043 --> 00:00:02.221
So the first 2 we're talking about the amount of work.

00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:05.431
And the correct answer is it takes n - 1 operations.

00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:09.360
To add up n elements takes n - 1 adds.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.259
Next, is its work complexity order of n? Yes, it is.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.119
So the amount of work that we do is linear with respect to the size of the input.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.535
If we double the size of the input,

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:21.760
we're going to double the number of additions that we do.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.795
Is its step complexity O(1), meaning independent of the size of input?

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:30.085
No, its step complexity is also linear in the size of the input.

00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:35.126
As we double the size of the input, we'll double the number of steps to take to reduce all these items.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.027
So to sum up, our serial reduction algorithm has a work complexity of O(n).

00:00:41.027 --> 00:00:45.430
What that means is that the amount of work is linear in the size of the input.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.262
If we double the size of the input, we double the number of operations that we're doing.

00:00:49.262 --> 00:00:55.301
Our step complexity is also O(n), meaning again that if we double the size of the input

00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:58.772
we double the number of steps it takes to compute the output.
