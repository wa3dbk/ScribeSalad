&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Notice that 3x squared and 2x both have a factor of x in them. If we divide

00:00:05.777 --> 00:00:11.768
3x squared by x, we're left with 3x. And if we divide 2x by x, we're just left

00:00:11.768 --> 00:00:18.028
with 2. So factoring this, 3x squared plus 2x, gives us x times the quantity 3x

00:00:18.028 --> 00:00:18.625
plus 2.
