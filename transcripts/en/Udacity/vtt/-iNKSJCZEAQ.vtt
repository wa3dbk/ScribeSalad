00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.241
Negative 3 is correct, nice equation solving if you got that one correct. The

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:10.847
lowest common denominator for our fractions is 9x. We know x is already a factor

00:00:10.847 --> 00:00:16.184
of 3x, so really we just need to find the LCD for 9 and 3x. When we use our

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:20.770
factor tree method we can see that we get a final product of 9x. And our first

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.138
fraction, the x terms cancel to 1, leaving us with 9 times 1 or 9. For our 2nd

00:00:26.138 --> 00:00:31.449
fraction the factors of 9 canceled the 1 leaving us with -1 times x, or -x. And

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:38.656
finally for our last fraction 9 x divided by 3 x equals 3. So we're left with 4

00:00:38.656 --> 00:00:43.710
times 3 which equals 12. Solving this linear equation will get a access equal to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.292
-3. Remember, we just reverse the signs here, since negative x equals 3, so

00:00:49.292 --> 00:00:54.773
positive x would equal negative 3. For this original equation, x cannot equal 0.

00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:59.416
It's an excluded value. And since our answer was x equals negative 3, we're

00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:02.093
okay. We can keep this as our solution set.
