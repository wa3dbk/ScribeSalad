00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now we have the phenomenal cosmic power to define functions.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Once we have them, we can call them with actual arguments,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and then inside the function body we can return with the return value.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Function bodies are statements which can contain expressions.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So we'll be evaluating or interpreting quite a bit.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And this is a lot of power.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In fact, it's going to turn out that this is really all you need, pretty much,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to be just as powerful as any other programming language.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Recursive functions pack a wallop. There's a lot going on.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And that means that this is actually a double-edged sword.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
With great power comes ... let's say lots of care that we have to take.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We've been writing together in Python a program that simulates,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
interprets, evaluates JavaScript,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and this means that anything that JavaScript could do

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we could also do in Python,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
because if for some reason we didn't really know how to write it in Python,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we would just leave it in JavaScript and run our written in Python JavaScript interpreter.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's a bit like that MC Escher drawing where 1 hand is drawing another hand

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that's actually drawing the first in a bit of a recursive loop.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We can use language A to simulate or interpret language B.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So on the 1 hand, if you'll permit me,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I can write a Python program that simulates any JavaScript program.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
That means that Python is at least as powerful as JavaScript.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We'll abbreviate JavaScript with JS.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It also turns out--not shown here, but it's actually very similar--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that I could write in JavaScript an interpreter for Python.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So JavaScript is at least as powerful as Python.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Both of these claims ignore speed because our interpreter or our web browser

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
might be a little slower than just running the appropriate code natively,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
just as translating natural language text from Spanish into Mandarin Chinese

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
takes some amount of time.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But there's a strong sense in which these languages are equally expressive.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Any computation I could carry out in Python I could also carry out in JavaScript.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Any computation I could carry out in JavaScript I could also carry out in Python.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I can be just as creative in either language.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Now, one language may look prettier than another,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
one language may take a little less time to say a certain thought,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to have a creative idea, but ultimately, I can express the same range of work,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
emotions, desires in Python and in JavaScript.

00:02:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is pretty powerful stuff.
