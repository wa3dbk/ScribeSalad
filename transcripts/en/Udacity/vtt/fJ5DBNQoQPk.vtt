00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.804
This function, y equals one half to the x minus 3 power is identical to this

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:12.100
one, but it shifted 3 units to the right. Now, I knew that shift needed to

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.580
happen, because here we have the point 0,1 and to transform 0,1 to 3,1, we just

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.526
need to move 3 to the right. A shift of 3 units to the right means replacing x

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:29.386
with x minus 3, which is exactly what's happening here. Awesome. It looks like

00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:32.914
you can transform exponential functions just like you can any other kind of

00:00:32.914 --> 00:00:37.206
function. The strategies we learned, many lessons ago, are going to be just as

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:40.356
applicable here, as they were for every other kind of function we've worked

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:45.312
with. That's really convenient.
