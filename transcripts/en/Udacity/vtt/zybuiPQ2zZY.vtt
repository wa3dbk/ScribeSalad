00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's recap RSA and see how things fit together.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We have our modulus n, which is the product of 2 primes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We have our encryption function, which raises m to the e power,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and we have our decryption function, which raise the ciphertext to the d power.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For the invertibility property, we need to know that m^(ed - 1) = 1 mod n.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What we know from Euler is that that's true for a and n relatively prime.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That means if we can pick e and d such that ed - 1 is equal to φ(n),

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
then we're real close to having the correctness property we need.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
To see how close we are, let's ask a quiz

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
whether we can determine if m and n are relatively prime.

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's the property we need to be able to use Euler's theorem.
