00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.094
If we factor out a 10,000 from each term in the original expression, then for

00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:12.048
the first term, we find 10,000 divided by 10,000 or just 1. For the second

00:00:12.048 --> 00:00:19.068
term, which we add to the first one, we get 0.03. That's our answer, 1 plus

00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:20.068
0.03.
