00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.856
In the last few lessons, we've looked at graphs of functions and talked about

00:00:02.856 --> 00:00:06.569
how they behave. We've seen some zeroes of functions that are integers, and

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.644
some that are fractions. But, what if we can't find x intercepts using methods

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:15.131
that we've already learned? What if, for example, our roots are irrational? How

00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:18.253
can we estimate where they are? That's what were going to look at next.
