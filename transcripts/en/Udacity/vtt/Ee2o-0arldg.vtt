00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.540
F represents the frequency, so the number of people of each blood type, p

00:00:04.552 --> 00:00:09.281
represents the proportion of people with that frequency, and the percent is,

00:00:09.293 --> 00:00:14.047
well, the percentage. This little symbol here, you're going to get pretty used

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.662
to it. It's called sigma and it means the sum. So in total, you know that the

00:00:18.674 --> 00:00:23.260
sum here should be 35 and the proportions should all add to 1, just as the

00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:27.875
percentages should add to 100. Hopefully you calculcated these numbers in the

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:31.660
last question. Now, let's answer some questions about this table.
