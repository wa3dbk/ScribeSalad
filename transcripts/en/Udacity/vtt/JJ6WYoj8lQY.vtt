00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.512
Does the point 3, 7 lie on the line y equals 3x minus 5? I'm going to walk you

00:00:04.524 --> 00:00:09.246
through some of the steps to do this, or at least give you some hints about how

00:00:09.258 --> 00:00:14.091
we should go about it. I'd like you to start by substituting in the proper value

00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:18.391
from the point into the left-hand side of the equation. L H S here is just

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:22.496
shorthand for left-hand side. So type in the value here of the number that this

00:00:22.508 --> 00:00:26.658
side should simplify to. Then do the same thing for the right-hand side. That's

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.731
what R H S stands for. Plug in the proper coordinate to the proper variable, and

00:00:30.743 --> 00:00:34.925
simplify this side of the equation. Once you've found the numbers that belong in

00:00:34.937 --> 00:00:39.090
these boxes. Tell me if they're equal to one another, and then, depending on how

00:00:39.102 --> 00:00:43.056
you answer that question, what does this say about whether or not this point

00:00:43.068 --> 00:00:43.954
lies on this line?
