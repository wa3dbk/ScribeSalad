00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.606
I'm here with Stephen Jones, who's a senior software engineer at Nvidia.

00:00:03.613 --> 00:00:05.312
Stephen, tell us about your job.

00:00:05.312 --> 00:00:10.449
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I am the CUDA lead at Nvidia, which means that I'm responsible for the

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:14.877
programming model and for the engineering which goes behind that.

00:00:14.877 --> 00:00:20.219
So, when we look at the set of things we could do for CUDA, for example,

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:23.088
the list is long--50, 60 things that we could do.

00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:25.670
We've got time for maybe 5 or 10 of them.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.093
And so I sit and evaluate what we can do, what's useful to do, what's the right direction.

00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:32.008
I'm not the only person who makes these decisions.

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:34.458
But I'm the engineering end of that.

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:36.649
So I, I sit there and figure out what the resources

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.487
are going to need to be, and what different groups we

00:00:39.487 --> 00:00:42.000
have to pull together to make these things happen.
