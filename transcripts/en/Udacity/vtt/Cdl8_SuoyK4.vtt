00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We would like to add digital signatures to the course accomplishment certificates

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that would allow someone who knows KU,CA, the public key of our certificate authority,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to validate that a certificate was generated by Udacity and earned by the person

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
whose name is in the certificate.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Assume m is the certificate string.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
For example, "Certificate of accomplishment with highest distinction earned

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
by Alice Hacker in CS587."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Assume E is a strong public key encryption algorithm,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
H is a cryptographic hash function, and r si a random nonce.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Which of these schemes would allow Udacity to generate unforgable,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
verifiable, signed certificates.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that are valid.
