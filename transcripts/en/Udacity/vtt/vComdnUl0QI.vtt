00:00:00.413 --> 00:00:03.278
To understand latency versus bandwidth with a real-world example,

00:00:03.278 --> 00:00:07.713
let's say my research group and I were going to drive from California to Virginia to visit Dave.

00:00:07.713 --> 00:00:09.986
This is 4,500 kilometers.

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:12.219
Now we could either take a sports car,

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.169
which holds 2 of us, and speed across the country at 200 kilometers an hour.

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:18.593
Or we could take a bus that holds 40 of us

00:00:18.593 --> 00:00:20.886
but only travels at 50 kilometers per hour.

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:23.193
What is the latency of each, measured in hours,

00:00:23.193 --> 00:00:27.000
and the throughput measured in people transported per hour?
