00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Alice is working for a global telecommunications company

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.480
that owns a telecommunications network around the world.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.450
So the network of her company looks something like this.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.730
And, of course, this is just to give you an idea; in reality the network is much larger.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.050
But they basically have telecommunications centers that are spread out around the world.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.920
And these communication centers are connected through cables, something like this.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.780
And again, there's many more communication centers, and many more cables here, of course.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.650
But this is just to illustrate the problem to you that she is working on.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.180
So you see, not every communications center is connected to every other communications center,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.340
but they're selectively connected through these blue cables here.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.330
Now, of course, for the company that Alice is working for,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.890
it's very important to check the integrity of the whole network,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.350
which basically means that you have to check if every single cable here is working.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.830
Now, to do this, her company can install monitoring devices,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.400
which I'm going to draw with a green circle like this here.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.350
So the company could, for example, install a monitoring device here.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.410
And what that monitoring device does is, it checks the integrity of all cables

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.900
that are connected to that communications center where you install the device.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.590
So it looks something like this.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.860
So installing a device here would allow you to monitor all these 5 cables

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.320
that are drawn green here, and of course in order to monitor the whole network,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.320
you would need more than 1 device.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.800
But you would not need to install a device at every single communications center.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.140
So for example, if you install another device here, which monitors these cables here,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.130
and another device here, then this communications center right here does not need an additional device,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.410
because all the cables that are attached to it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.410
are already monitored by the other communications centers.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.740
Now, installing 1 of these devices is, of course, quite expensive.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.180
And that is why Alice has been asked by her employer, the telecommunications company,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.130
to figure out a way to monitor the whole network by installing as few devices as possible.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.380
And, as I said, the whole network is, of course, much more complex than this.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.070
So it contains about 500 communications centers, say, so she cannot do it manually.

00:02:02.070 --> 99:59:59.000
She definitely needs to write an algorithm to help her with this.
