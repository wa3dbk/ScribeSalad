00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.450
Let's also look at examples of what happens when we change the lens that has

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.990
a different focal length.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.800
Let's look at the example we have looked at before, a tree,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.210
a lens, an images of a lens here.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.610
Of course, let's assume that this lens has a focal length of three inches.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.390
So this time around, I'm only going to change the lens and

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.460
give it another lens with a different focal length.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.090
So now, we have another lens, this lens has a focal length of say six inches.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.620
Remember, we want the image to be formed, at the focal plane of this lens,

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.450
so now, the best image that will be formed at this focal length,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.210
because of the fact that it's farther away would be larger than this one.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.100
So just, by changing the lens focal length,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.640
we notice that the image formed is much bigger.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.340
So this allows us to now basically be able to

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.170
control how we form images on our sensor, by changing the focal length,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.280
we can actually play around and generate different types of images, and

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.788
most times, the focal length f could be longer, or shorter.

00:01:05.788 --> 00:01:08.830
And we will see examples of the impact of this on what kinds of

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.490
images are formed in a bit.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.730
Now remember, focal lengths are specific to lenses themselves when they're

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.450
manufactured, most of times, of course, when you see complex lenses, you'll also

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.670
get a variety of lenses composited together and the dynamics of these lenses,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.170
are the ones that give you the effective focal length of that lens.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.260
In this case, of course we're just simplifying all of our lenses to

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.790
be just one simple lens here.
