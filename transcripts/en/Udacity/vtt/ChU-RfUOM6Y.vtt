00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.580
You can think of a design study as an empirical scientific experiment. As such,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.040
there are research questions, subjects of study, experimental conditions,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.990
methods, tools, metrics, independent and dependent variables, data collection,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.020
statistical analysis, and conclusions. As with a scientific experiment and

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.050
overall goal of a design study is repeatability. That is, someone else should be

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.430
able to take your study report, use it to recreate the study conditions, and

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.660
reach the same conclusions that you did.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.610
It is one of the goals of this class that you'll learn the skills to produce and

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.820
present an industrial quality design study.
