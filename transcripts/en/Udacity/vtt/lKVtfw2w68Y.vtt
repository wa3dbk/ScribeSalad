00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.330
As we get deeper in to the Java plugin,

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.210
it'll be useful to know where
to get more information.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.110
The first place to go is the Java quick
start guide, and the Gradle user guide.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.340
You can find the link in
the instructor notes.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.760
It has a quick rundown of
the capabilities of the Java plugin.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.190
And if you need a refresher for

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.060
setting up a Java project in the future,
this would be a great place to go.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.910
For deeper information
on the Java plugin,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.350
check out the chapter in
the Gradle user guide.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.570
Here you'll find the information,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.460
all the tasks the Gradle Java
plugin defines.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.710
There's also a great graph of
the dependencies between the tasks.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.930
You can also get details on the default
settings, like project layout and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.620
how to change them.
