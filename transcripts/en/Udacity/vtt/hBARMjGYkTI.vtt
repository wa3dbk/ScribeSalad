00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.000
A surprising finding from our earlier work is

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.080
that spammers can perform behavior on the network

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.145
that is extremely uncanny and unlikely to be

00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:12.970
performed by a legitimate network user. For example, what

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.600
we saw is that the spammer could hijack an IP prefix for a very short period

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.950
of time, such as 10 minutes. Send the

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.220
spam or potentially multiple spam messages from IP addresses

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.970
inside that IP prefix, and at the end of the attack withdraw the prefix. This

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.390
allows attackers to use ephemeral IP addresses essentially

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.620
rendering IP blacklists ineffective. In fact, we saw

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.740
on any given day about 10% of the email senders are from previously unseen IP

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.750
addresses. This ephemerality or transience of the IP

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.770
addresses of the spam senders makes it particularly

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.400
difficult to maintain a blacklist. In fact,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.550
we've found many single-packet features that tended to

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.930
work well. In other words, features that

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.890
a receiver could make a decision on just

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.180
based on the first packet that a

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.380
sender sends. Such single-packet features include, the distance

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.190
between the sender and the receiver, the density

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.950
in IP space in terms of how many

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.140
other mail senders are nearby, and the local

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.890
time of day at the sender. Other features,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.540
such as the AS of the sender's IP,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.150
also worked well. If we're willing look beyond a

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.890
single packet and look at a single message,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.340
the number of recipents, and the length of

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.680
the message also prove to be effective in

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.070
distinguising spammers from legitimate senders. Finally, we can look

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.590
at aggregates. For example, if we're willing

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.120
to look at a group of email messages

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.340
we can see how message length varies over time or across a group of different

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.811
messages. Putting these features together in a

00:01:55.811 --> 00:02:00.509
system called SNARE, or Spatio-Temperal Network Level Automated

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.073
Reputation Engine achieved a 70% detection rate

00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:07.151
for a false positive rate of about one-tenth

00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:10.600
of 1%. This level of accuracy is good enough to be

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.905
used in practice. It provides comparable performance to state of the art

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:20.780
IP-based blacklists such as Spamhaus. But it only uses network-level features,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.140
thus making it less susceptible to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.950
the ephemeral nature of IP-based blacklisting.
