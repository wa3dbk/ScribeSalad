00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.116
So, from an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense that our bodies have these

00:00:04.116 --> 00:00:07.828
internal mechanisms that propel us to act in ways necessary for survival and

00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:15.150
reproduction. Let's take hunger and thirst, for example. So these needs propel

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.594
us to act in ways toward, to look for food and water. And if we're successful,

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:24.945
we survive, we reproduce, we pass on our genes. Now we also have a need to

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:29.085
reproduce. Now as individuals we don't actually need to reproduce in order to

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:32.820
survive. Although, of course, as a species we do. it's a little more

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.230
complicated, so we'll talk more about sex and reproduction later on in the

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.680
lesson.
