So, I search for how to record audio in swift.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.990
And in here, I found this Stack Overflow.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.510
By the way, the link to this Stack Overflow with some helpful code

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.480
is available in the instructor notes.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.540
Now, one thing software engineers will do on a regular basis is that they will

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.620
read code that other people have written, and they will try and

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.320
figure out how that code works.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.380
And here is our opportunity to practice that.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.100
This is the code I got from Stack Overflow with a few changes that I made.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.890
Now, we know that this code can help us record audio.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.080
See if you can figure out how the different lines of the code can help us

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.380
accomplish that goal.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.580
In other words, try and

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.010
translate this code into simple English, and enter your thoughts in this box.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.600
By the way, this code is also available in the instructor notes for

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.470
you to experiment with.
