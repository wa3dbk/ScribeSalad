00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.870
The secret sauce in Tornado for achieving the

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.120
scalability is the concept called clustered object. The idea

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.710
is that from the point of view of

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.350
all the pieces of the operating system, executing on

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.370
the different nodes, there's a single object reference.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.120
The object reference is the same. But the object

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.760
reference under the covers may have multiple representations.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.420
So for instance, n0 may have a represenatation that

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.990
it is lookating at, different from n1, different

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.780
from n2 but the object reference is the same.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.380
So there is an illusion of a single object. So, that's what I meant when I said

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.890
logically the operating system designer. I think of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.520
a shared data structure's logically the same thing. But

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.020
physically, it may be replicated under the covers. Course,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.460
who decides to replicate it, that's the decision of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.090
the operating system as well. We'll see that in a minute. This is where the idea

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.500
of clustering comes about. The na, the name

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.820
clustered object. The degree of clustering, that is, the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.890
replication of a particular object, it's an implementation choice of

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.760
the service, so as a designer of the service you make a decision whether

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.600
a particular object is going to have a singleton representation,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.100
or is going to be one per core in the machine or one per cpu meaning

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.100
it is shared by all the cores that may be there on a single cpu. Or maybe one

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.920
representation of an object for a group of

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.300
processes. So these are all design decisions that is

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.910
left up to the implementor of the service. But

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.330
when designing the service, you can think abstractly about

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.710
the components of the service containing objects and

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.100
each object is giving you the illusion that it

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.060
is single object reference. But under the covers

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.040
you might choose to implement the object with different

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.870
level up replication, and of course if we

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.700
are talking about replicated objects you have to worry

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.150
about the consistency of the replicated objects, and

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.460
this is were the, suggestion in the tornado system

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.340
is to maintain the consistency of the objects.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.330
Through protective procedure call, that is implemented under

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.260
the colors in the operating system. So in

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.870
other words, as a designer of the service, you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.360
are going to orchestrate the sharing of the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.930
data structures that are replicated and you orchestrate

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.380
maintenance of the consistency of the share data

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.850
structures. Through protective procedure call that you execute across

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.680
these replicas, and don't use the hardware coherence

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.100
mechanism in order to maintain the consistency, and

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.440
the reason for that is the hardware cache

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.050
coherence it can be indiscriminate about how it does

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.990
the hardware cache coherence whenever you touch a

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.210
shared memory location. If it is present elsewhere, it

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.520
is going to update that. And that's the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.080
reason we don't want to incur the overhead of

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.560
the hardware cache coherence and replicate it. But if

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.670
you replicate it then the hardware is normal. And,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.260
therefore, you have to worry about keeping these copies

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.760
consistent with one another. But, of course, when in doubt,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.100
use a single representation. And that way, you have

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.510
the hardware cache coherence as a security blanket when you're

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.750
not sure yet about the level of clustering that

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.180
you want in order to reduce the amount of contention

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.750
for shared data structures. All of these may seem

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.830
a little bit abstract at this point of time,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.040
but I'll make it very concrete, when we talk

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.570
about a simple example, namely the memory management subsystem.
