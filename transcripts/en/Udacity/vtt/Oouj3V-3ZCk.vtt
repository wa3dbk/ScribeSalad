00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.320
Let's look at the left size of that equation more closely. We could remove an x

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.570
from the first two terms so we'd have x times x plus 5 plus 6. Is this

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.947
expression the same as this factor for it. Let's try and figure this thing out.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:18.382
I'm going to have you multiply these two factors and then we'll be able to

00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:23.876
determine if this is the same as this. If we distribute this x, x plus 6 and the

00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:29.226
5 text plus 6, what will we get the boxes below? Write the product of the term

00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:31.803
that we get from the multiplication.
