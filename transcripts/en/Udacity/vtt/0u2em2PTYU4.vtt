You should have one goal, to make images look

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.490
as beautiful as they can on the user's device, while

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.660
using as little bandwidth as possible. Now this last

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.900
point is critical. Network bandwidth is most assuredly not free,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.100
particularly on mobile devices. We'll learn more about that

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.490
in the next lesson on performance, and in our final

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.990
lesson on offline. If you didn't care about bandwidth,

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.710
you could just serve massively large images all the time.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.510
But a full screen image for a ChromeBook Pixel

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.145
is 4.1 megapixels, whereas on a Nexus 4, it's only

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:38.320
0.9 megapixels. IPhone 5 is only 0.7. The best size

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.290
for images is very different on each of these devices.
