00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This brings us to the end of unit 3.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
As long as we have a channel with integrity, we have a solution to our key distribution problem.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We can use the Diffie-Hellman protocol where at the end of the protocol

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we've established a shared secret.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Once we're established that shared key we can use it to send messages,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
using our symmetric encryption operations from the previous two units.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We still haven't solved many of the important problems that Diffie and Hellman identified

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in this 1976 paper.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The one that I highlighted at the beginning was digital signatures.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We can't do digital signatures this way because the key is shared between Alice and Bob.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That couldn't be used to sign something since either Alice or Bob

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
would be able to make that signature.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
To have digital signatures, what we need is asymmetric crypotography.

00:00:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's the main topic for Unit 4. Hope to see you there.
