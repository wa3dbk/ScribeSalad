Let's switch things up a little bit. So over here, I still have graphed the

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:08.109
equation g of x equals the root of x. But I want us to ignore the graph for a

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.023
second, or just use it as a general guideline. And instead look at this new

00:00:12.023 --> 00:00:16.317
function, h of x equals the square root of the quantity x minus 5. Now, what is

00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:20.580
the domain of h of x this time? Please write your answers as an inequality here

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.494
instead of an interval notation.
