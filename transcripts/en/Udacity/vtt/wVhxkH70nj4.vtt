00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We've still got the code the I wrote for the Luhn checksum.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And this is kind of a redundant bad code but I wrote it quickly and I think it works.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So we have the Luhn checksum function.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And the first thing it does is looks at the length of it's argument.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That is to say, it looks at the length of the string over which it's going to compute a checksum.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's also going to initialize the checksum variable to be 0.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, if we're computing a checksum over an even number of digits,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the remainder mod 2 is going to come out to 0.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So in this case, we're going to loop over the digits and the checksum.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That is the range(l) goes from 0 to length -1.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And here what I'm going to do is add 1 to that number

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
so that we can get a 1-base numbering system like I showed you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in the explanation of Luhns algorithm.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So here now, if we're at digit 0 in Python we're at digit number 1

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in the 1-base human number system and so if that comes out to be 0 when moded with 2

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
now with an even number digit and so in that case we're going to add

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the value of that digit into the sum; otherwise, we're going to call this Luhn digit function

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
on the same value and the Luhn digit function is just sort of the obvious thing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It multiplies the number by 2. If it's greater than 9, it returns 9 less than the number.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Otherwise, it just returns the number.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now, the other case is that we're checksumming an odd number of digits.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
In that case, we have exactly the same logic with the even and odd cases flipped around.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So here we're taking the Python zero-based digit adding 1 to it to get a human

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
1-based numbering system moding with 2.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If it comes out to be even, we're doing the Luhn digit computation.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If it's odd, then we're just adding in the value of the number.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And finally, we get a checksum that we've accumulated here.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And we take that mod 10 and that gives us our actual checksum value that we're going to use.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So now, here's the algorithm for generating a valid random credit card number.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So the inputs are remember a prefix and a total length in digits.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So the number of random digits we're going to generate is the total length

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
minus the length of the prefix minus 1 for the checksum digit.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now we're just going to assert that that's greater than 0 just to be careful.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And now we're going to set N as our credit card number that's in progress.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So we're going to initialize that to be just the prefix.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Now for the number of random digits we have,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we're just going to make up a random digit and append it to the string.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Finally, we're going to add a zero checksum to it and compute the Luhn checksum.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
If that Luhn checksum comes out to be zero, we're done.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
If that Luhn checksum comes out to be non-zero, we have to do the little inversion

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that I talked about where we take the checksum where we subtract the checksum from 10

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and now what this little bit of logic does is it strips off the last character.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
That's the zero we added from the credit card number and adds on the checksum number.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So that's how easy it is to generate a valid credit card number.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And now there is one valid function just to check if the Luhn checksum is 0.
