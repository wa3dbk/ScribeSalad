00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.646
Let's see if we can compare the mesh and the

00:00:02.646 --> 00:00:05.814
bus throughput, for a small four core system, where the

00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:08.850
traffic is evenly distributed so that each core sends a

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.778
quarter of all the messages in the system. And the messages

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:15.860
that each core sends are sent round-robin, to all the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.650
other three cores. So if we are core 0, we send

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.290
messages to 1, then 2, then 3, then 1, then

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.470
2, then 3, etc. If we're core 2, then we send

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.910
to 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, etc. And

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.410
you can assume that this is totally randomly distributed,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.980
so that, we don't necessarily get any synchronicity among

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.850
these accesses, pretty much just like a third of

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.230
the traffic sent by each core goes to each

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.820
of the other core, but you can assume that,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.006
it happens willy nilly. Each core, sends 10 million

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:50.785
messages per second. The bus, can support 20 million messages

00:00:50.785 --> 00:00:53.485
messages per second, the mesh can support

00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:56.485
20 million messages per second per link, and

00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:59.560
obviously, the four core are going to saturate the

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.260
bandwidth, in which case they will have to

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.030
slow down proportionally so that. They match

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.922
the bandwidth of the bus. The question for

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:15.030
you is, the speed up achieved by switching to the mesh, from the bus is what?
