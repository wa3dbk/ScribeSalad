Let's answer this quiz by filling in our Venn diagram. I'm going to put the

00:00:04.377 --> 00:00:08.715
letters of M in this circle and we'll put the letters of Y in this circle. I

00:00:08.727 --> 00:00:13.325
should 1st look at M and Y to see which letters overlap between the sets. I know

00:00:13.337 --> 00:00:17.683
the letters a and t are in both of the sets, so I'm going to list those in, In

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:22.129
the middle. We can remember that the letters in the middle are the inner

00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:27.133
section. It's what shared, or what's between m and y. So for the intersection of

00:00:27.145 --> 00:00:31.610
m and y, we have the set a and t. The other letters are just listed in their

00:00:31.622 --> 00:00:36.451
respective sets, And then for the union, we want to list everything once. So we

00:00:36.463 --> 00:00:40.232
have this set, the letters of m or the letters of y, the union.
