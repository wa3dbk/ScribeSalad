00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.798
You need to pick your
investors very carefully,

00:00:03.798 --> 00:00:08.328
probably as carefully that you want
to pick your your co-founders.

00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:12.132
Because while you can
part from a co-founder,

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:16.090
it's very hard to part form an investor.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.111
He have money.

00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:23.386
He put money in your company and
the money's gone, and what now?

00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:25.490
It will be very hard to buy him out.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.834
So, you need to make
sure that you're taking

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:33.322
money from someone you can work with and
you can learn form and

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:36.761
can bring actual value
to you in your company.

00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:42.898
Because if you're working with someone
who just can't bring you money.

00:00:42.898 --> 00:00:47.417
There's this horrific expression,
friends, fools and family.

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:50.377
And what is fools?

00:00:50.377 --> 00:00:52.455
You're taking money from a fool.

00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:53.489
It's so bad.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.185
It's getting the entrepreneur
condescending, yeah,

00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:59.346
I'll take money from that fool.

00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:02.830
Or you're taking money from
someone who can't help you.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.110
It's horrible and
it makes entrepreneur seems stupid.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.869
So, never take money from a fool.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.889
And try not to take
money from family also.

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:12.852
And not from friends.

00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:17.577
I hate that expression,
family, friends, it's horrific.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:23.842
But choosing the right investor
can make or break your company.

00:01:23.842 --> 00:01:27.742
Because a bad investor that try
to micromanage the company and

00:01:27.742 --> 00:01:29.318
try to micromanage you.

00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:30.978
And demands explanations.

00:01:30.978 --> 00:01:35.075
And wants to be involved in everything.

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:38.208
Can really make you miserable.

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:43.073
And if you're not experienced you don't
know how to put him in his place.

00:01:43.073 --> 00:01:48.533
And it can make your life very,
very hard.

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:53.420
A good investor can make your company,
can help you do everything.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.161
But a bad investor, and

00:01:55.161 --> 00:02:00.740
there's more bad investors than good
investors, can really hurt you.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.020
And there's not enough money in
the world to to make this worthwhile.
