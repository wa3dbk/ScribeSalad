00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.100
In the previous video, you learned
that virtually every device that

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.180
communicates across the Internet
has a physical layer, and

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.370
these intermediate communication
protocol layers that sit on top of it,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.400
in order to enable the transmission
of packets and data streams.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.650
Sitting on top of these layers
is the application layer.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.870
This layer is responsible for

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.620
setting all of the protocols in
which applications exchange data.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.830
The most popular
application level protocol

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.570
is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol,
or HTTP.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.600
HTTP functions via a series of requests
and responses between clients and

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.490
servers respectively.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:39.180
You may be familiar with other
acronyms like FTP, IMAP, SSH, and POP.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.790
These are also some other popular
application level protocols.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.410
The original OSI model has the
application layer sitting as the highest

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.720
level set of protocols for
communicating across the Internet.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.820
But other protocols and
technologies for sending and

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.360
receiving information
via APIs also exist.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.150
In order to better understand and
organize these technologies,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.240
I would like to introduce two more
layers to our existing model.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.700
Let's call these two layers the web
service and message formatting layers.
