00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.492
The answer is 0.959. Now on our graph if we're looking for the maximum point, we

00:00:05.492 --> 00:00:10.328
travel up, and it looks like the peek is right about here, just to the left of

00:00:10.328 --> 00:00:15.440
the line x equals 1. That means that .959 is the closest answer. So what does

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.670
this tell us? Well, this tells us that if Athena cuts squares of side length

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.080
.959 inches out of each corner of a piece of paper, the box you would get out of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.280
that would have the highest volume that any box you could make out of that

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.153
initial piece of paper could.
