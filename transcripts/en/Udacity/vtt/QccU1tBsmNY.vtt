00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.000
Before we dive into more
content let's take a step back.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.890
Here's what you can expect to
learn in the upcoming lessons.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.550
In the first lesson we'll start by
covering how you can generate ideas and

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.410
evaluate them against each other.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.920
Then you'll learn techniques for
validating your ideas so

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.530
you know you're working on a product
that has a place in the market.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.310
In lesson two, you'll learn about high
level concerns for user experience and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.660
user interaction.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.280
Now you won't be a professional
user experience designer by the end

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.290
of the lesson.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.930
Instead, you'll have a strong sense
of the big questions you'd answer

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.630
about user experience.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.080
And you also identify common
design elements in products.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.340
With a validated idea from lesson one,
and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.940
the knowledge of user
experience in lesson two,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.050
you'll start to build mock-ups of your
app, or website through a design spread.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.510
You'll learn how start ups get real
feedback from users in just a few days.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.120
This is the same methodology
that Google Venture uses

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.220
with startups such as Nest and
Blue Bottle Coffee.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.160
Finally, in lesson four,
you'll learn about metrics, so

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.170
you can figure out how to improve
the product and grow the business.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.830
Along the way, you'll be completing
tasks related to the final project.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.730
In the end, you will have gone through
the effort of generating, researching,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.890
validating, and testing a mock
up of your product with users.
