00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.899
The rate at which Athena's car accelerates depends on how hard she presses down

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.256
on the gas pedal. Athena makes the choice about how hard to press down on the

00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:12.809
gas pedal and then that action determines how the car's motion changes. The

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.908
second option down here doesn't really makes sense. The car doesn't change its

00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:20.970
own motion, and then affect Athena's foot. For the second one, the can's height

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.248
above the ground depends on the amount of time that has passed since Athena

00:00:25.248 --> 00:00:29.558
tossed the can. The can's height doesn't control how time passes, time passes on

00:00:29.558 --> 00:00:33.497
its own. We can, however, look at how the height of the can changes from moment

00:00:33.497 --> 00:00:34.073
to moment.
