00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is because lists are mutable.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That makes them unlikely candidates to put into hash tables.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here's why.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's suppose we did allow lists to be hashable.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now we're trying to compute the hash function for y,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and let's say we have a very simple hash function--not a very good one--that just says

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
add up the values of the elements.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's also say that the hash of an integer is itself,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so the hash code for this list would be equal to 6, the sum of the elements.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But now the problem is, because these lists are mutable,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I could go in, and I could say, y[0] = 10.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Y would be the list [10, 2, 3].

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now when we check and say, is y in d?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We're going to compute the hash value 10 + 2 + 3 = 15.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That's a different hash value than we had before.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So if we stored y into the dictionary when it had the value 6,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and now we're trying to fetch it when it has the value 15,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
you can see how Python is going to be confused.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now, there's 2 ways you could handle that.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
One--the way that Python does take is to disallow putting the list into the hash table

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in the first place because it potentially could lead to errors if it was modified.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The other way is Python could allow you to put it in,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but then recognize that it's the programmers fault,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and if you go ahead and modify it, then things are not going to work anymore,

00:01:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and Python does not take that approach, although some other languages do.
