00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.090
One of the most powerful features of MongoDB is the ability

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.780
to query against fields that are not simply scalar values such as

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.140
strings or integers. But those that are themselves structured data such

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.190
as a arrays. As we know, MongoBD can have rate values and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.079
you see a couple of examples, right here on the screen.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.010
We can query within arrays with a couple of different ways. Now

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.880
I think the best example from the Autos collection actually has

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.140
to do with model years. So let's take a look at that.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.030
Now the simplest example is to provide a single value

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.910
for model years in our query document. Let's see what happens.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.470
So in this case we can see that

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.170
our model years here, for this particular vehicle are

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.610
1975 through 1980. And we queried with just

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.170
1980. Even though the value for model years fields

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.047
is an array, this value will match. MongoDB

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:51.280
searches inside array value fields, for individual values to

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.860
match. And by building an index on a fields

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.100
such as this, those queries will be very efficient.
