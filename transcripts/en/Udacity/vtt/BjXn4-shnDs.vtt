00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.520
Now let's look at how the principles
of authentication and

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.890
key exchange that we have discussed
are used in actual systems.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.210
Kerberos is a standard protocol
used to provide authentication and

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.520
access control in a network environment,
typically an enterprise network.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.800
Every entity in a network,
that is, all users and

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.340
network resources,
such as workstations and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.120
printers, have a master key that it
shares with the Kerberos servers.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.880
And the Kerberos servers perform both
authentication and key distribution.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.470
So for convenience, we use KDC
to refer to a Kerberos server.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.490
For a human user, the master key is
derived from his or her password.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.780
For a network device,
the key is configured in.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.330
All the keys are stored
securely at the KDC.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.920
Now let's go over a few
typical Kerberos scenarios.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.322
When user Bob logs in,

00:00:54.322 --> 00:01:00.850
his workstation contacts the KDC with an
authentication service request message.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.016
The KDC generates a per day session key,
SB.

00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:11.560
And the so-called ticket-granting ticket
that contains SB and the ID of Bob.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.930
And the ticket is encrypted
using the KDC's own key.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.850
The KDC then sends back a message
to Bob's workstation, and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.590
this message is the authentication
service response.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.480
The message contains the per day session
key and the ticket-granting ticket.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.550
And the message is encrypted using the
shared master key between Bob and KDC.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.460
And because KB is the master
key shared between Bob and

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.160
KDC, only Bob's local workstation
can decrypt this message.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.221
And then it can store the private
key and the ticket granting ticket.

00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:53.715
Bob's local workstation will then use SB
for subsequent messages with the KDC,

00:01:53.715 --> 00:01:57.835
and it would include the ticket
granting ticket to remind and

00:01:57.835 --> 00:02:00.065
convince the KDC to use SB.

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:05.984
That is, any new request to the KDC will
include the TGT in the request message.

00:02:05.984 --> 00:02:10.615
And the new ticket from the KDC
will be encrypted using SB.

00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:12.573
There are several benefits
with this scheme.

00:02:12.573 --> 00:02:17.595
First, the localhost does not
need to store Bob's password or

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:24.030
password hash once Bob has logged in and
once he has obtained SB from the KDC.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.680
Second, the master key KB,
that Bob shares with the KDC,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.640
is only used once everyday
when Bob logs in initially.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.780
That is, the exposure of the master key,
which is derived from Bob's password and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.090
is subject to password guessing
attacks is very limited.
