Now before we continue, and we look at more details

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.400
of version control systems, I want to ask you a

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.230
quick question about VCS. I want to know whether you

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.190
have used a version control system before, and if so,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.090
which one or which ones. I'm going to list in

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.260
here some of the most commonly used version control systems,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.840
like CVS, Subversion, GIT, and I'm also allowing you to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.640
specify other VCS in case you have used different ones.
