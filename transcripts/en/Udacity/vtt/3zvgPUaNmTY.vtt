00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.400
This figure shows the overall processing
of a message to produce a hash value.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.340
The first step is padding so
that the message is a multiple

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.170
of 1,024 bits because the message is
going to be processed block by block.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.980
And each block has 1,024 bits.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.720
The padding bits are appended to
the last block of the message.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.440
First we leave the last 128
bits to store the length

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.259
of the original message,
that is the length before the padding.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.500
Then for the space between the original
message and the last 128 bits

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.988
we add one and a number of zeros
necessary to fill up the space.

00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:44.226
And that's how padding works.

00:00:44.226 --> 00:00:48.881
After padding, then the message
is processed one block at a time.

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:52.012
Again, each block has 1,024 bits.

00:00:52.012 --> 00:00:56.657
The logic of per block processing
is described in the next slide.

00:00:56.657 --> 00:01:01.643
The result of processing the current
block is the input to the processing

00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:03.470
of the next block.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.070
That is when processing
the second block,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.700
the input includes not only
the second message block but

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.190
also the output of the processing
of the first block.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.170
And for the first block,
the input includes the Iv.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.610
The Iv is a 512 bit value,
hard coded in the algorithm.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.270
Again the message is processed
one block at a time.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.030
At each block the input incurs
the output of the processing

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.370
of the previous block.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.530
And the result of the processing
of the last block

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.370
is the hash of the entire message.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.650
Now let's take a look at
the processing of a message block.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.780
The processing involves 80 rounds.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.150
The input includes not only
the current message block but

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.570
also the result of the processing
of the previous block.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.600
And the result of the processing of
the current block will be the input

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.630
to the processing of the next block.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.920
The result from the processing of the
previous block is a 512 bit value, and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.610
it is divided into 8 64 bit values.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.240
And they are a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.590
Again, the processing
involves 80 rounds and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.080
each round the input includes
the result from the previous round,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.060
some constant k, and some words derived
from the current message block.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.890
The constants here provide
randomized values and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.760
the purpose is to eliminate any
logravities with the input data.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.086
The operations at each round
include circular shifts and

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:39.964
primitive pulling functions
based on and, or, not and x, or.

00:02:39.964 --> 00:02:44.400
The output of the last round is added
to the input to the first round.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.050
And the result will be used in the
processing of the next message block.
