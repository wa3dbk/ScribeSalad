In the last couple of lessons, we've talked about the range of screen

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.520

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.090
screen density. Your web applications need

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.170
to deliver good image quality across a

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.980
broad range of devices, but they need to do so at a minimum cost.
