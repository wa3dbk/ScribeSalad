00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.689
Efficiency is perhaps the most important
concept I'll teach you in this course.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.780
So make sure you understand
it before moving on.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.510
Efficiency, also called complexity,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.309
is how well you're using your computer's
resources to get a particular job done.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.370
You can normally think about
it in terms of space and time.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.740
How long does your code take to run,
and how much storage space do you need?

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.610
Let's think about efficiency
in terms of cutting hair.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.440
Normally, your hair would be
snipped off in clumps, and

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.480
you would just compare some strands you
cut to a group you're about to cut,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.319
to approximate where your next cut goes.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.890
However, you could cut one
strand of hair at a time and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.450
compare each strand to a ruler or
measuring tape,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.800
to make sure the exact same amount
gets cut every single time.

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:51.605
That's ridiculous, though.

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:53.834
It would take a crazy amount of time,
and

00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:57.150
it really doesn't matter if
hair is exactly, precisely cut.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:02.550
If you could use less time to get the
job done pretty well, than you're good.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.540
Often, the tradeoffs for
algorithm efficiency are similar.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.160
You could take a slow,
methodical approach, but there's

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.500
often a faster method that accomplishes
the same goal by reducing repetition.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.880
Efficiency can rely heavily on your
creativity and your ability to get

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.119
the most done with minimal resources,
but there are a lot of known tips and

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.000
tricks that you'll be expected to
know in a technical interview.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.839
An interviewer will expect you to
know some common data structures and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.700
the efficiency of doing
basic things with them,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.800
as well as some knowledge of
specific well known algorithms.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.470
In this case, an algorithm is just
a series of steps for solving a problem.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.360
One of my favorite moments
in my programming career

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.220
was the first time I used
an algorithm to improve my code.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.750
I had a function that took hours
to run on this huge dataset.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.220
But after applying an algorithm,
it only took seconds.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.940
Writing really efficient code can come
off with another tradeoff between

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.630
time efficiency and space efficiency.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.638
What if your code could run in
just a fraction of the time

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.270
by storing temporary values
in a new data structure?

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.100
For that decision, you would need to
weigh whether the time of the person

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.859
using your code or the amount of
memory needed is more important.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.690
By the end of this course,
you'll have most of the tools and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.497
knowledge you need to
make efficient code.
