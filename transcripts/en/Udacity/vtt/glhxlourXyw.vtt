00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.130
So we wanted to make this dog move, simple enough. We simply make the dog move

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.281
just the same as the car. But of course now we have to edit the dog class, and

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:15.248
make the movement happen. There's the dog class. We add Moveable to the list of

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:21.180
interfaces. And here's my move method. It's simply enough, I simply move both

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.990
the picture of the dog and the name text. And I was asked to move it vertically

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.569
at one pixel per second. That's why the horizontal displacement is zero and the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:37.381
vertical displacement is the same as the seconds. When you run the program,

00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:40.410
then here you can see the car move, and the dog move.
