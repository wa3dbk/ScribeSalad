00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.816
So, for our last quiz of the unit, I want to go back to the menu example we

00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:07.970
started with and ask you to define classes that provide behavior that will allow

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.270
us to represent main dishes and appetizers. So, both main dishes and appetizers

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.981
have some properties in common. They all have names and prices, and they both

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:20.155
might have a description. As well as an indication whether they're appropriate

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:24.649
for vegetarians or not. These have default values of None and False. A MainDish

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:29.140
comes with sides, and the default number of sides is 0. An Appetizer does not

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.480
come with any sides, but it serves a variable number of people, the default

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.394
being 1. So, your goal is to find a dish module that will provide this behavior,

00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:41.106
it will define types for at least the MainDish and Appetizer, we'll be able to

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:45.788
create a MainDish. Passing in a name, a price, and then optional description and

00:00:45.788 --> 00:00:49.552
vegetarian parameters. When we print out a MainDish, we'll see the name of the

00:00:49.552 --> 00:00:52.790
dish, followed by the name of the price. If there is a description, we'll see

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.360
that. Here's another example of a MainDish. This one has two sides and is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.585
vegetarian. And when we print this out, we'll see the star, meaning it's

00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:04.747
vegetarian. And that it has two sides. We can also create Appetizers. And

00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:08.818
appetizers have names, prices, might have a description, might have vegetarian,

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:12.290
and might have the number of people they serve. And we can print out an

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.130
Appetizer, and it'll print out the name, the price, extra information like a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.420
dish would, as well as the number that it serves. Here's another example. We're

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.948
creating an Appetizer with a description that serves three and we'll see it

00:01:23.948 --> 00:01:27.780
print out the description followed by the serves. So, your goal is to define a

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.745
module that provides this behavior and to do it in a way that reuses code as

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:35.962
much as possible. You want to avoid having any unnecessary duplication of code.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:39.334
Doing this well will take advantage of several of the things that I've

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:40.673
introduced in this class.
