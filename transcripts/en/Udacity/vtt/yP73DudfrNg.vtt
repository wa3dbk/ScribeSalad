00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.100
OK, so let's go through the solution. A news site

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.390
like New York Times, absolutely. It's an internet service, it

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.690
has lots of users and the load on the service

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.440
probably varies so the scaling of app engine could be used

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.320
a perfect match. What about a device driver testing system?

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.970
Well, it of course depends on what kind of system this

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.650
is but just the fact that device driver is part

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.610
of the title, make you think that it needs access to

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.540
low level resources within in a computer. Remember, app

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.780
engines are generic platform to build scalable applications and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.120
from that perspective this does not sound like a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.660
match. What about a personal portfolio site? Just because

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.980
it's a personal site and probably does not need

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.610
massive scale, does not mean that app engine can

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.700
not be of great use. App engine simplifies development

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.440
of server-side applications greatly, so this is a good match.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.600
What about a video game? Well, if we just mean the user interface part then

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.700
app engine is not a good match, app

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.960
engine is used to develop server side applications.
