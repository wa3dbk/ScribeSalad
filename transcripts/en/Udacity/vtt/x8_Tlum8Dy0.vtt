00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.390
Before we jump into some real code,

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.700
there's one requirement that
you need to know about.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.264
Service workers require HTTPS.

00:00:09.264 --> 00:00:12.201
If your site isn't served
over a secure connection,

00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:16.010
the browser simply won't
load the service worker.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.981
The only exception is during
development where local host and

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:21.925
its equivalent are allowed.

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:26.090
While this may sound like
an arbitrary requirement,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.670
service workers allow you to
intercept network requests,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.435
modify them, redirect them,
even totally fabricate responses.

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:36.640
While I'm sure you'll
use this powers for

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.740
good, there are some
evil people out there.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.340
By requiring HTTPS you can feel
confident that the service worker that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.890
gets installed hasn't been tampered with
during its journey across the network.
