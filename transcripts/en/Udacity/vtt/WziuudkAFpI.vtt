00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.949
Thinking back to what our variables x and y stand for, x is the number of

00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:10.107
gallons of solution that Grant will buy, and y is how much it's going to cost

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:15.496
him to buy that much. If we fix the amount that Grant's going to spend, at $850,

00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:21.638
what that really means is fixing our y value at 850. So, the line we need is

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:30.346
just y equals 850. Let's graph that. And here is our lovely horizontal line.
