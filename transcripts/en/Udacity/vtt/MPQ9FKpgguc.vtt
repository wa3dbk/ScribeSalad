00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.630
Let us look at adaptation
a little bit more deeply.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.740
So once again here is the process
of case-based reasoning.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.860
I have kind of blurred
the retrieval step.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.380
We're going to assume here that
the retrieval of the case has already

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.430
occurred, perhaps using the KNN
method that we discussed last time.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.420
Last time we also said two other things.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.300
One, that a fundamental conundrum that
AR agent faces that the problems they

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.350
encounter are usually very complex
from a computational perspective.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.220
And they have only limited
calculative resources.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.530
So then how can they address
computationally complex problems,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.493
with limited calculative resources,
in near real-time?

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:36.939
Seemingly effortlessly.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.370
And we said part of the answer might
be that memory supplies with an answer.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.200
But we are going to make
a small amendment to it.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.690
Memory supplies with an answer,
an almost correct answe,r so

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.600
that the adaptation that we have
to do is very small, very minor.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.070
It's a tweak.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.140
As an example of adaptation
being mostly tweaking,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.660
consider this simple problem,
the everyday problem of cooking meals.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.410
So you may have a recipe for
your favorite kind of meal.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.560
And imagine at this time you're going
to have your favorite meal, perhaps

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.890
with different company, or perhaps with
a different kind of salad or appetizer.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.780
Well in that case you might tweak
your recipe for that particular dish.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.200
You're not going to change
it in a radical way,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.680
you're simply making
a small change to it.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.790
&gt;&gt; So, Ashoke, another example of this
that comes to mind very readily for me,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.210
goes back to your programming
example from earlier in this lesson.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.170
One thing that almost every
program I write has to

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.270
do is input data from a file.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.490
But right now, I couldn't write
that process from scratch.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.900
What I always do is I look at however
I did it the previous time, and

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.500
I'll modify it for the new folder or

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.250
the new kind of data or
the new kind of file I'm reading from.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.750
But really I'm just taking the same
process and tweaking it for

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.080
my new problem.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.900
&gt;&gt; That's a good point, David.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.020
In fact in the design commonly
there's an old cliche,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.020
which says that all designers redesign.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.600
Design is fundamentally evolutionary,
we take all designs and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.090
we evolve them slightly and
that's how we get a new design.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.199
And the same thing is happening
in case-based reasoning here.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.470
It is saying that often this
particular solutions that we

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.610
come up with are revolutionary in
the nature in the sense that they

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.920
are small tweaks over
previous solutions.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.320
So the next question becomes,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.250
how can we adapt an old case to meet
the requirements of new problem?

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.510
There are potentially
several ways of doing it.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.930
We will discuss three important ways,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.310
perhaps the three most common
ways of adapting a case.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.495
They are called the model-based method,

00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:37.900
the recursive case-based method,
and the rule-based method.
