00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.840
So the first major component we're going to dive

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.250
into to help, is the HTML5 Application Cache. This let's

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.710
you provide a local cache of HTML files, CSF, JavaScript,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.640
images, any other resources your client webapp may use. And

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.190
get the browser to use them even before it tries

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.760
to hit the network. So let's take a look at

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.840
how this works and how we can use it. The

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.740
application cache is a manifest that you point to from

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.850
inside your HTML element. Let's take a look

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.900
at the cache manifest for our conference application. The

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.710
manifest starts with a magic header, cache manifest Lines

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.010
that start with a hash sign are actually comments.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.540
Typically, the second line is a comment with some

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.700
kind of cache version string. More on that later.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.390
But this is followed by a cache section. Now

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.840
what do you think goes in the cache section?

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.060
Should it be every file that's on the servers file system? Every resource

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.460
that can be statically served, or should it be a collection of cat videos?
