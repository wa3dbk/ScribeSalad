00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.855
So the answer is, we want to select the part

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:04.870
of the word that we can still use in our

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.039
solution. So we can't keep the a, and we can't

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.280
keep the lower case u, so those are positions 0

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.427
and 1. From position 2 to the end is good,

00:00:14.427 --> 00:00:18.640
so we can produce that using the index selection. We're

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.910
going to select from s, starting from position 2. If we

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.860
wanted, we could count all the letters and select from

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.770
s to the final position. We can also just use

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.975
a closed bracket. We don't need to count the letters that's

00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:34.460
going to select from position 2 to the end of the string.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.170
Now, we want to get the uppercase U in front. So,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.330
we're going to have an uppercase U added to that. And

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.940
finally, we need the print to print that out. So, here

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.500
that is in the Python interpreter. We have the definition of

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.860
s that was provided. And what we're going to do is print

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.225
out capital U plus S, two colon to the

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:57.750
end. And as expected, we get our result: Udacity.
