00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.180
I think in order to learn the language,

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.650
it's important to know a little
bit about the cultural background.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.220
In order to learn that, I think you
need to seek out the people who

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.220
are interested in sharing it with you.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.090
And I think that's probably
the most important part is to be

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.630
culturally aware and respectful of what
people are willing to share with you.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.070
So for example, I was not culturally

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.950
sensitive when I was thinking
about my thesis topic.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.110
I wanted to bridge the gap between my
undergrad thesis on native language and

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.950
its effect on my identity and tech since
I'm currently in Computer Science.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.247
I wanted to bridge that gap and where
I was I wouldn't say disrespectful,

00:00:54.247 --> 00:00:56.991
just not going about it the right way.

00:00:56.991 --> 00:01:00.060
Usually you're invited by somebody.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.410
You're invited to somebody's home and
it's about just being in

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.480
that space with that person and whatever
they're comfortable sharing with you.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.800
Like an elder, the person who I was
wanting to speak with was an elder.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.060
And I spoke with his son and
he's like, you can't go in there and

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.010
just ask questions and
expect them to be answered.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.820
And that's exactly what
I was intending to do.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.720
And after talking to him
a little bit more I understood.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.230
And all the knowledge that
I wanted to gain from that

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.790
conversation was not going about
it in a culturally sensitive way.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.202
And that's me, within the tribe,
another tribal person,

00:01:44.202 --> 00:01:47.824
there are, I want to say, regulations.

00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:49.750
What can you do, and what can't you do?

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.850
And what I was doing
was not appropriate.
