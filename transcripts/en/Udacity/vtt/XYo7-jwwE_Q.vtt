Hi. This is the Python glossary.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There's going to be a lot of new and potentially confusing functions and techniques

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that we use in CS212.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When that happens, I'm going to try to record something to help you all out.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is the place where I'm going to post that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I might not be able to get to every single function that's covered in the course,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but if there are any that are particularly confusing to you, you should let me know in the forums.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Remember, if there is anything that I don't cover,

00:00:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
you should check out the Python or just do a search.
