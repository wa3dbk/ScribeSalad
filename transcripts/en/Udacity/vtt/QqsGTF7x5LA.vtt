00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.040
We mentioned that the greedy approach of constructing

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.920
a DHT leads to tree saturation. And the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.360
congestion happens at the node, which happens to

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.180
map to a lot of clustered keys. The coral

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.300
approach is very simple, don't be greedy. What

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.080
does that mean well what it mean the

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.080
greedy approach,when we have a key K, we try to store it in the lower N who's

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.680
note i.d is equal to K the coral approach

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.820
use this as a hint not and absolute. But you

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.410
still have to have a method to the madness, if

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.680
you're going to store it in some place different from N.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.630
Then, those who are trying to discover it, have to

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.720
have a method to the madness, of where you stored

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.540
your key. We'll see how that is done. So the

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.270
top level bit I want you to take away is

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.420
that in the Coral DHT The get and put operations are satisfied by nodes that are

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.599
different from the key K. The node IDN may not be close to key, and

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.940
that's why the DHT that Coral implements is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.340
called a sloppy DHT, and we'll talk about

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.430
details of that in a minute. The rationale

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.810
of course, is you want to avoid tree saturation,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.620
that comes about when lot of keys map to a particular node ID. And also in

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.940
the process, what we want to do is, spread

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.820
the metadata overload so that no single node

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.190
in this democratic process of helping one another

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.540
is saturated or overloaded by being a good

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.050
citizen. How does Coral do it? It has

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.730
a novel key-based routing algorithm, which we'll describe,

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:49.900
but the basis for that key-based routing algorithm is to compute the distance

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.310
between, the source of a get or a put operation and the destination for that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.120
get or put operation. The destination by default is going to be the node

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.890
whose ID is equal to the key that you're looking for. So the distance between

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.940
the source and the destination is X or distance, meaning [UNKNOWN] or

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.100
the bit pattern Of the node ID for the source and the bit pattern for

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.120
the node ID for the destination that X or of the two qualities give

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.240
you the distance between the two nodes in the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.010
overlay network space. And the reason why you want to do an XOR

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.630
is because an XOR operation as opposed to,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.460
say, doing a subtraction, is going to be much

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.790
faster. We do an XOR to find out

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.450
the distance between the source and the destination that

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.130
need to communicate. So, for instance, if the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.990
source at, this is fourteen, and the destination address

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.200
is four. Remember that these are null IDs

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.160
in the null ID space which at the level

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.310
of the user. And if you do an X sort of that you get 10, so

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.625
10 is the distance between the source 14

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:08.950
and,and the destination for. The bigger the XOR

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.570
value, the larger the distance between the source

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.220
and the destination in the application namespace. And

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.880
since we are dealing with fairly big numbers

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.190
here, the node ID could be 160 bit quantity.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.960
And that is the reason we want to use

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.560
some simple operation that will get us the distance.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.825
X R is a very quick operation to

00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:35.100
implement to get the distance between source and destination.
