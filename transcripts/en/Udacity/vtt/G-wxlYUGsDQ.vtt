00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.755
Let's start by changing this radical sign to a power. Cube roots give us powers

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:09.150
of 1 over 3. Notice that I put the parentheses around the entire quantity,

00:00:09.254 --> 00:00:13.637
negative 8x to the 6th since the radical sign extended over all of those

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:18.425
factors. Now, all we need to do is what we did in the last quiz, distribute this

00:00:18.437 --> 00:00:23.651
exponent to both of the factors in the term. That gives us negative 8 to the 1

00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:28.418
3rd times x to the 6th to the 1 3rd. The number that we need to multiply by

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.579
itself 3 times to get negative 8 is negative 2. So, that's our coefficient. And

00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:38.099
the cube root of x to the 6th is just x squared. So, our final answer is

00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:39.432
negative 2x squared.
