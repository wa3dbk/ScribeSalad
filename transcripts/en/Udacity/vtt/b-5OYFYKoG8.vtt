00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.330
The next step is to add
a second horizontal stack view.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.450
So that it can hold a chipmunk and
Darth Vader sound effect buttons.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.900
With the main storyboard file open and

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.900
the play sounds viewer controller
selected, open the main storyboard file,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.650
and select the play
sounds view controller.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.760
Let's search for
stack view here in the objects library.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.050
Drag a horizontal stock for

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.750
you from the object library
into the document outline.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.556
Make sure that it's embedded
inside the vertical stack view,

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:33.150
our outer most stack view
here in the document outline.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.220
The easiest way is to drag it above
the first horizontal stack view and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.800
reorder them here in
the document outline.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.540
Your document outline should look
similar to what you see here.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.210
One more thing, with this new
horizontal stuff you selected,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.298
change the distribution setting in
the attribution specter to fill equally.

00:00:52.298 --> 00:00:56.560
Xcode may be warning you
about auto layout constraints

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.540
because this new horizontal stack view
does not have any UI elements inside it.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.270
A search for buttons here,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.220
I'm going to drag one under
our Neo horizontal stack view.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.320
In the actually inspector I'm
going to remove the text for

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.940
this buttons title and
changes image to chipmunk.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.120
I'm going to rename it here in
a document outline, the chipmunk button.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.980
We need to follow the same steps
to create the Darth Vader button.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.030
We'll drag a button from the object
library underneath the new

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.360
horizontal stack view,
remove the text from the title and

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.640
this time change
the image to Darth Vader.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.520
We need to make sure that these
buttons are on the same level.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.700
That is, they're inside
this horizontal stack view.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.760
We can do that by toggling
this disclosure triangle here.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.230
That was easy, now we have four buttons
in this view perfectly aligned and

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.710
we have not had to add a single
auto layer constraint.
