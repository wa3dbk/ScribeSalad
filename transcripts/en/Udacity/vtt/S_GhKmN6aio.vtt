00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.469
So to quickly summarize this
part of how to build panoramas,

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.980
we basically went into details what five
steps are used to generate panorama.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.090
Talked about image re-projections,
specifically with, for

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.200
the cases of panorama building.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.280
Introduced the whole
concept of homography and

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.785
how it can be computed
from two pairs of images.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:22.430
And then also introduced
the whole concept of RANSAC,

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.440
to allow to deal with good matches and
bad matches and that could be used for

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.490
a variety of things including assisting
us with being able to find the most

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.690
reliable features, and also,
perhaps finding panoramas, and

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.260
then we talked a little bit about
additional things that we need to know

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.920
about panoramas, including projection
models and stuff like that.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.470
Again, this is just scraping the surface
on the whole idea of panoramas but

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.090
again, there are lots of other readings
that I'm going to be asking you to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.270
look at that'll help you build a better
understanding of these panoramas and

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.830
we'll do a simpler assignment
on panorama building but

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.430
also know there are lots of
softwares out there that you can use

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.330
to learn how to do this kind of stuff.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.950
Additional reading that you
should look at include these.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.192
There is a whole lot of literature
out there I encourage you to look at.

00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:10.720
There's also publicly available
softwares that you can play around with,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.740
and also commercially
available softwares.
