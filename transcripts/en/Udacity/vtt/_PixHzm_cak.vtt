00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.930
So we explored a number of
mandatory access control models,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.820
ranging from ones that address
confidentiality and integrity

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.640
to those that are designed to meet
the needs of commercial applications.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.305
We then revisited the idea of
a trusted computing base, or a TCB,

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:24.440
and how we can evaluate the level of
assurance that is provided by the TCB.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.790
We saw that it not only depends
on what the TCB does, or

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.630
its functionality, but
also how well it has been tested and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.830
verified to ensure that it
is free of vulnerabilities.
