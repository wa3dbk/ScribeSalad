00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This was a trick question, which was totally nontrivial.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Multiplying something with A+b modifies the mean in a very straightforward way.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So this is the valid expression here, aµ+b. So 6 would've been the right answer over here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You already know that adding a constant doesn't change the spread of a distribution.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So the result should not have a b inside. That takes out this term and all those terms.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We also know that the spread has nothing to do with the mean so this term is out.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So the question really is, is it aσ² or a²σ²?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And if you remember correctly when we did the salary raise by a factor of 10%,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we noticed that the standard deviation goes up by this factor.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Therefore, the variance goes up by the square of this factor

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and 1 is the right answer here and not 7.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And that's interesting because in doing arithmetic with the mean and the variance,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you have to be very conscientious as to whether you use the variance or the standard deviation.

00:01:04.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you get that wrong, then you've got the wrong answer.
