00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.150
So I think Charlie was
a great interviewee.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.760
I think she did excellent job
at answering my questions.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.340
She definitely took her time thinking,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.280
right, she thought, she didn't feel
rushed trying to answer my questions.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.520
And that's very important because it
allowed me to stay connected with her.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.660
I think she did an excellent job with
answering the questions in general,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.980
she went straight to the answers
which was very good.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.320
I think she was very good at
explaining what she was thinking and

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.470
taking me with her through
the process of getting to the answer,

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.237
which i think is very important.

00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:42.910
There are three things
that she did very well and

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.460
the first one was guiding me
through her thought process.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.590
Whenever I asked her a question
she would not just rush in and

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.030
start answering.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.830
I asked her a SQL question, right,
and she explained exactly what

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.970
she was going to write before she
even started writing on the board.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.850
Same with a programming question,
she told me how she would solve it.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.230
She told me how it's not
the optimal solution.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.290
We agreed that it was
a good enough solution.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.990
She started writing.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.330
I think that those are that
the most important thing

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.980
to do in a technical interview.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.190
And she was very clear with how she
explained which is something that they

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.610
don't is you need to be very good at I
would look for I want her to be able to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.350
explain things to other people
because it's a huge part of our job.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.970
The things that she could have worked
on a little bit more was definitely

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.290
being more familiar with the machine,

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.770
learning algorithm that she
mentioned during the interview.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.540
I think another point where she might
be able to improve a little bit,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.940
is when once she saw
the program in question.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.550
When she went to work through examples.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.880
It was a bit too fast it was
kind of hard for me to follow.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.110
So maybe even making a table of
what a viable look like operation

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.650
to ration of the for loop.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.790
Might help me be able to keep keep
up with what she was saying and

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.200
stay connected with her.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.690
And you know I think she
did a good interview.
