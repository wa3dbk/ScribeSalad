00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.500
Couple of other things are looking at
the previous example that I just showed

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.520
you that we should make concrete.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.080
A good function for steel detection
has one stable, sharp beat.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.602
For example, again the same
function that we looked at, f.

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:17.190
And if I was actually to trace this out,
this is not a peak here.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.650
This would be problematic.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.970
Here it has multiple peaks,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.780
would be problematic because I
wouldn't know which scale to choose.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.470
This is the kind of behavior you want.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.380
You want to be able to kind of see
as the region size gets bigger,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.990
this function basically
gives me one peak.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.300
Again, some of the ideas here basically
suggest that we can actually do this for

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.770
most normal images.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.200
A good function would be the one
that responds to the contrast or

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.530
intensity changes in an image.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.850
I'm aware all of this still
sounds a little abstract, so

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.920
let's look at a few examples
to make this a bit concrete.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.130
Here is an example of the same
building at two different scales.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.240
In the case, this is an example of
a zoomed up image, and now zoomed out.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.630
Here basically look at the scale and
basically we look at the function.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.930
This a nice peak here.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.450
This is the one we want to look at.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.440
And at the same scale level,
this is visible at this point.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.010
So in essence, now we need the two
scales for these two images.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.670
This allows us to look at scale, and
actually model the scale that will allow

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.820
us to make our detector
invariant to scale
