00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.220
Check out this awesome multitool.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.270
Consider the possibilities.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.160
If I have this baby with me, I could eat
a steak on the go wherever I want to.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.040
On second thoughts,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.450
it's going to be way more pleasant if
I just use this fantastic knife here.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.860
Sure, it doesn't have all the bells and
whistles, but

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.230
it's really good at its main job,
being a knife.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.060
And now we're talking IDE versus editor.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.100
An IDE, short for
Integrated Development Environment.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.320
Is an attempt to create a development
productivity Swiss army knife

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.810
that can do it all.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.430
Editing, debugging, building,
compiling and even, optimizing.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.250
But, IDEs come at the expense of
tools that do one thing really well.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.870
That's not to say that IDEs never work.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.950
Far from it.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.300
For app ecosystems, such as iOS or
Android, the vendor offers official

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.980
support, and controls both
the programming language, and platform.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.850
Which is why why so many of native
developers use Xcode, Android Studio, or

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.440
Visual Studio.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.270
But on the web, we already have
to live with fragmentation.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.780
Different browsers,
devices and standards.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.030
We could try to pretend that CSS,
HTML and JavaScript come in a beautiful

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.330
tightly controlled bundle and
build an idea around it.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.930
Or we could do what most web
developers decide to do.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.560
Embrace the chaos and
use individual tools best for

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.340
each job while ensuring that
they function well together.
