00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.350
So, now we've had the chance to
explore market segmentation.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.905
We're going to advice into some
exercises, and we want you to be able to

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.167
be involved, even if you don't
have an idea of your own yet.

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:12.540
So, Ronnie and I have some exciting
news we want to share with you.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.655
We decided to create Embarkment.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.820
&gt;&gt; Like many entrepreneurs,
our idea came passion and need.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.640
Lauren is obsessed with dogs.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.880
&gt;&gt; That's very true.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.000
&gt;&gt; And I'm passionate about finding
good, safe, and fun place for

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.620
my dog to stay while I travel for work.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.960
&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie needs reliable and
affordable place for a dog,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.640
and I need to spend more time with dogs,
because I can't have my own right now.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.200
Plus, I could use the extra cash.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.940
&gt;&gt; We figured we were not alone in
how we felt and what we needed.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.255
So we decided to create Embarkmetn,
a safe home for your dog to stay in with

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:46.418
people who are excited to spend time
with your dog while you're away.

00:00:46.418 --> 00:00:48.210
&gt;&gt; So the idea is simple.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.909
You sign up for our app, as either a
sitter and tell us your availability and

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.043
about the environment you'll be
keeping the visiting dog in.

00:00:55.043 --> 00:00:58.804
&gt;&gt; Or, sign up as an owner, and tell us
what you're looking for in a sitter and

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:00.590
when you'll be away.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.129
We will match you with the best sitter
for your dog at a reasonable price.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.900
&gt;&gt; So, we need to use market
segmentation to come up with

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.240
a marketing plan.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.120
&gt;&gt; Obviously the first should
be sitters versus owners.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.090
But even within each of these,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.220
we have to understand who are the
different users and who to focus on.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.450
&gt;&gt; Why don't you join our team and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.180
help us conduct a market
segmentation for Embarkment?

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.850
You can start with one practice
of market segmentation and

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.980
then try another until you have
a solid segmentation of the market.
