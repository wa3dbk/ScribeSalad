00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.759
For this homework, we asked you to remove dead code.

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:07.067
That is code that could not have any effect

00:00:07.067 --> 00:00:10.989
on the final return result of the method we’re

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:13.742
interested in. So, let’s go ahead and just dive right

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:17.252
into this. We take a fragment; if you remember

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:23.025
the fragments are of this shape where the first part

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:27.746
of the tuple is the variable to be assigned to and

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:32.305
then the next part of the tuple is the expression

00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:35.485
that is being assigned to it, in this case one is

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:39.261
being assigned to A or A operational, one is being

00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:42.071
assigned to B, 2 is being assigned to C etcetera.

00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:45.217
Now we’re not really concerned with what

00:00:45.217 --> 00:00:47.948
specifically the operations are. We don’t care

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:50.491
what operations are being done. We just care that

00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:53.756
something is being done to these variables,

00:00:53.756 --> 00:00:56.054
because if there is something being done, even if

00:00:56.054 --> 00:00:59.185
it ends up setting them to the exact same thing, we

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:02.000
can’t necessarily know that ahead of time. So, if

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.868
you have a fragment of this shape, then we store

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:09.425
that as the old fragment, as the un-optimized

00:01:09.425 --> 00:01:12.549
fragment. And that’s the first argument to this

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:18.352
method. And the return is the end return value;

00:01:18.352 --> 00:01:21.352
it’s the list of variables returned at the end of the

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:23.858
fragment. And if they’re returned at the end of the

00:01:23.858 --> 00:01:26.262
fragment, they’re automatically live, as we said

00:01:26.262 --> 00:01:29.970
up here. Now we want to create a new optimized

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.838
fragment of just the live variables. So we start off

00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:39.653
by initializing that to an empty list. And we set a

00:01:39.653 --> 00:01:43.091
variable called live equal to the returned live

00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:45.602
variables, because we know those are live.

00:01:45.602 --> 00:01:49.666
Now for every statement in the fragment starting from

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:52.200
the back, so we’re working backwards from the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.881
return statement, back up to the top, we check if

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:59.700
the first element of the tuple statement, that is the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.740
left hand side of the statement, is already in live.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.596
That is, it is one of the live variables currently.

00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:12.198
If it is, then we add that statement to the new

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:15.604
optimized fragment. Otherwise we fall through

00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:19.573
and now we take the list of live variables and we

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:24.131
remove the variables that we’re now assigning to.

00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:26.934
So we take all those out. From there, we update

00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:30.693
the live list with all the variables that are currently

00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:32.989
on the right hand side of statement. We run

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:36.397
through the entire fragment doing that over and

00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:38.485
over until we get back to the top. Once we’re

00:02:38.485 --> 00:02:40.298
done with that, we check if the new fragment is

00:02:40.298 --> 00:02:43.646
equal to the old fragment. If it is, then we return

00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:45.826
the new fragment. We didn’t change anything.

00:02:45.826 --> 00:02:49.564
So we just return and stop and we’re done. If it isn’t,

00:02:49.564 --> 00:02:51.819
well, then we might have further optimizations as

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.184
we discussed earlier. Then we return, removing

00:02:55.184 --> 00:02:57.447
dead of the new fragment in return. So we

00:02:57.447 --> 00:03:00.425
recursively call this until we don’t get any

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:02.817
further changes, because hopefully we can

00:03:02.817 --> 00:03:05.141
optimize further. Now we’re going to check that

00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:08.305
removed dead gives us what we would expect if

00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:11.594
we ran through all the optimizations by hand, and

00:03:11.594 --> 00:03:15.247
I’m not going to bother going through all of these.

00:03:15.247 --> 00:03:17.517
You can read them fairly easily and when we do

00:03:17.517 --> 00:03:20.744
that, we see that we get true values for each of

00:03:20.744 --> 00:03:24.071
these. This is a fairly involved little bit of code.

00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:25.869
It takes a little bit to think about and this is a

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:29.805
very useful optimization because we can

00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:32.683
potentially get rid of a lot of code doing this.
