00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
That's the important part of the key.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We can see that this certificate was signed using a signature algorithm.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is PKCS#1 using RSA encryption--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that's the padding scheme we talked about in Unit 4--and SHA-1 is the hash function.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Then we can see the value of the certificate, and this is it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We have 1024 bits, and this is what we need to use to convince ourselves

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that this is a valid certificate.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Of course, this is actually work that the browsers is doing.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We're really trusting the browser to implement this checking correctly.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What is in this signature?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It is the result of encrypting the hash of the certificate contents,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
using the private key of the issuer.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The signature algorithm tells us what we're using for the encryption and the hashing functions.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Both of these are popular but perhaps somewhat questionable choices.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
SHA-1 is known to have some weaknesses

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that may make it possible for attackers to find hash collisions.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
For this quiz, I want you to decide whether or not the certificate contents

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that is used as the input to the hash here should include the signature itself.
