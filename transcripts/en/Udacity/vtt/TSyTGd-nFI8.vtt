An airline is having a sale, maybe it's time to go on vacation. They're using

00:00:05.092 --> 00:00:09.854
this Java code, to calculate a discounted price. If a flight to Las Vegas was

00:00:09.854 --> 00:00:14.600
originally $95, what's it's price after the discount? If the original price of

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.255
a flight to Chicago was $100, what's it's price now? What's the discounted

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:24.665
price? If the original price of a fight to New York City is $105. What its

00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:25.520
