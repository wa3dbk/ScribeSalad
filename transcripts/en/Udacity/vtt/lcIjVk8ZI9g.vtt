00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.868
Here is the drive method. We increment the location and now we want to remove

00:00:04.868 --> 00:00:10.640
all passengers who wanted to get to that location. That turns out to be a bit

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.295
tricky so I'll want to find the passenger and then remove it. To remove a

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:19.636
passenger I need to know the index. So I have an index i starts at zero, up to

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:25.005
but not including the passenger size. I kept the i passenger, I test whether

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:31.640
the destination of that person equals to current location and then I remove it.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.125
That's all fine, but there's something that one needs to be very careful about

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:42.613
and that is when you remove the passenger you can't increment the index. Here's

00:00:42.613 --> 00:00:46.630
what I mean. Here are my passengers and let's say i is 1 and now Jane has

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.788
reached the destination, she gets removed then of course Mary now ends up in

00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:54.748
place one and then I need to come back to the loop with i staying at 1 so that

00:00:54.748 --> 00:01:02.438
I can examine whether Mary should also, leave the car. So that's why there're

00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:06.660
two branches here. In this branch, I removed the passenger, and in the other

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.416
branch, I increment i, to get to see the next one. Now the car, and the person

00:01:12.416 --> 00:01:16.448
class, have most of the functionality that I need, but somewhere I still need

00:01:16.448 --> 00:01:20.192
to put the entire simulation together.
