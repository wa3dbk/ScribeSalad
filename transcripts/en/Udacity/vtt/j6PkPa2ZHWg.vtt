00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.515
Inserting an element into our tree,
when it has no order is relatively easy.

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:07.970
We'll just talker node
onto another node.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.350
Maybe it's a leaf or
maybe it's a parent with only one child.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.435
We only need to make sure that
we're being the two children rule.

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:18.255
We're given the root
at the beginning and

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:21.410
we'll need to keep moving down
the tree until we find an open spot.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.120
How long will it take
to find an open spot?

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.400
The worst case is that we
travel down the longest path

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.770
until we find the farthest leaf.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.530
In that case we'll travel
through the number of nodes

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.460
equal to the height of the tree.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.110
But what is the height of a binary tree?

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.630
Like we did with our sorting algorithms,
let's look at some examples and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.120
reason through it.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.500
Here are two different trees.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.510
We can call these perfect trees,
since every node,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.120
except the leaves on the last level,
has two children.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.169
It looks like this tree with
3 nodes has 2 levels, and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.856
this one has 7 nodes and 1, 2, 3 levels.

00:01:01.856 --> 00:01:06.400
As the tree grows bigger each new level
has the capacity to hold a number of

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.790
nodes equivalent to a power of 2.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.380
Mull over that for a second.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.640
Each node can have 2 children.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.390
So each new level can have twice as
many nodes as the one before it.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.310
Since we've gone back to
talking about powers of 2,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.790
your mind should jump to log (n).

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.410
Does that apply here?

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.100
Let's take a look.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.500
We see the same pattern that
we saw in binary search.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.640
The number of levels increases
near a power of two, and now,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.450
we have a good visualization
to understand why.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.270
At every level, we're adding
roughly twice as many elements.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.509
Every time we need to add a new level or

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.790
in a binary search, divider our array
another time, it's because we're giving

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.720
ourselves the space to allow for
about twice as many elements.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.280
Remember that we're adding
a power of two at each level.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.250
So when we count up the nodes overall
it won't be exactly a power of two.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.410
Having three levels doesn't mean
an overall node count of eight.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.978
But it does mean that the fourth level,
itself, will have eight elements in it.
