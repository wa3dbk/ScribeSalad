00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now that we know the basics of finite state machines,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
let's change them up.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Suppose I have this finite state machine from before.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It matches a - z, followed by 0 - 9.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I want to change it into a new finite state machine that's going to accept [a - z] + [0 - 9].

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That is, 1 or more copies of a - z and then exactly 1 copy of 0 - 9.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We're going to be able to do it by adding just 1 edge.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
My questions for you--fill in the blanks--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which state should get the edge by state number,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.346
and what's the label for that edge going to be?
