00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.770
In Milgram's study, he obviously could not tell the participants that it was a

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.414
study on obedience to authority. Instead, he told them it was a study of

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:14.240
memory. And here you can see the original advertisement that Milgram used. When

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.364
the participant arrived, there were always two other people present. One was

00:00:18.364 --> 00:00:22.821
Milgram, who was the experimenter and then there was another person. And

00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:26.526
Milgram had these two people draw slips to determine whether they're going to

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:31.919
be a teacher or they're going to be a learner. Unbeknownst to the participant

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.092
the person who was with Milgram was actually confederate. Meaning that person

00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:42.344
was working for Milgram. Therefore, when they chose slips, Milgram had arranged

00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:46.126
it that the real participant was always the teacher, and the learner was a

00:00:46.126 --> 00:00:51.580
confederate, or a person who was working with Milgram. Now remember the

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.371
participant thought this was a study on memory. So Milgram told the participant

00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:00.403
that he was going to read a series of words and that the other participant, the

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:06.753
learner, who was a confederate, would have to remember those words. Every time

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:13.520
the learner would get a word incorrect, the teacher was to deliver a shock. The

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.829
learner was to memorize those word lists. And provide correct answers. And

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.574
during the study Milgram, who was the experimenter, observed the teacher and

00:01:22.574 --> 00:01:28.251
provided instruction. So here the teacher thought that he was to read words and

00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:32.598
deliver shocks, but in fact Milgram was testing that participants level of

00:01:32.598 --> 00:01:39.356
obedience aAs well as his willingness to inflict pain to the learner. Now,

00:01:39.356 --> 00:01:43.758
remember the learner was a confederate working for Milgram, and he did not

00:01:43.758 --> 00:01:48.864
receive any actual shocks. And he actually didn't even respond to the word

00:01:48.864 --> 00:01:53.845
lists. All of the responses were pre-programmed. And finally MIlgram served as

00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:57.562
the authority figure in this study and he was positioned next to the teacher

00:01:57.562 --> 00:02:03.360
while the teacher was reading the words and supposedly delivering the shocks.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.645
So we had the teacher, the learner and Milgram. Now let's go into a little more

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:13.256
details on the specific methods of the experiment. The teacher and learner were

00:02:13.256 --> 00:02:16.496
to be tested in seperate rooms, but before the learner left, the teacher

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:22.310
actually was hooked up to the shock machine and received a very small shock.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.070
And this was to let the teacher know that the shock generator actually worked.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.220
And also so the teacher was aware of the type of shocks that the learner would

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.491
experience. Millgram instructed the teacher to provide a shock for every

00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:40.151
incorrect response. And, they would start at the low end of the shock

00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:44.710
generator. And with each consecutive incorrect response, the teacher had to

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:52.876
provide a shock. And, that went up on the shock generator to 450 volts. So

00:02:52.876 --> 00:02:57.446
here's the experimental arrangement. Here we had the teacher, who is sitting in

00:02:57.446 --> 00:03:01.045
front of the voltage machine, and notice that the learner is in a separate

00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:06.178
room. Remember, the learner is the confederate and when the study began, he

00:03:06.178 --> 00:03:11.888
actually just left the room. All of the responses were pre-programmed. Notice,

00:03:11.888 --> 00:03:16.280
too, that Milgram was sitting near the teacher as he was observing that person.
