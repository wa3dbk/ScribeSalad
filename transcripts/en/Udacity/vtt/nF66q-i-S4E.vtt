Well, I hope you understand slope and know how to find the slope given the

00:00:04.032 --> 00:00:08.209
equation of a line. I want you to practice finding the slopes of these three

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:12.532
equations. You can put the slope for the first equation in this box, the slope

00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:16.686
for the second equation in this box, and the slope for the third equation in

00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:19.640
this box. Dont worry too much, just try your best.
