00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.103
Here's another equation for you to solve. And the ones we've been working with

00:00:05.103 --> 00:00:10.040
have definitely gotten gradually more complex, so this one is another step up.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.070
We have 3 times the quantity times 2 to 3t minus 2, plus 6 equals 15. Now you

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.770
could approach this equation in the exact the same way as when we did just

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.160
before this. You'll just have a few more steps at the end to reach the

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.475
solution. Now, you might want to take a couple seconds right now and pause the

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:33.014
video to try solving all the way to t on your own. If you feel like that might

00:00:33.014 --> 00:00:35.534
be a little bit much, let's go through it in a slightly more step-by-step

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:39.175
manner. Now of course, there are many different ways to solve this problem, and

00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:43.633
I'm just going to show one of them. First, we're going to treat 2 to the 3t

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:49.042
minus 2 as our variable. So, we write the equation isolating 2 to the 3t minus

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:53.973
2 on this side. If 2 to the 3t minus 2 seems like something sort of complicated

00:00:53.973 --> 00:00:57.690
to work with, and sort of weird to think about as a variable, then you can

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.533
substitute in another letter, like u for instance, in place of this whole

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:06.059
thing. Then just solve for u.
