00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.760
One of the challenging things about
working with a language that uses

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.130
closures, is it's not always
particularly obvious when a piece of

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.880
code is going to be run.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.850
When Gradle's invoked with
a name of a task to perform

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.350
it can't just go ahead and
execute that task.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.250
It first has to figure out
that task dependency and

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.380
those task dependencies, and so on.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.080
Gradle then executes all the tasks, and

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.140
in the correct order, before
the target task is eventually executed.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.940
That means that before any
task execution happens,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.070
the whole dependency
graph has to be created.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.140
There are actually three phases to
the lifecycle of any Gradle build.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.560
Initialization, configuration,
and execution.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.225
The initialization phase is
mostly concerned with setting up

00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:44.960
multi-project builds which we'll
talk about later in the course.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.880
In the configuration phase
the build script is executing

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.200
which configures all
the project's tasks.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.440
This is when a directed
acyclic task is built up and

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.070
Gradle determines which tasks need
to be run, and in which order.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.261
Then finally, in the execution phase all
the task actions of all the tasks that

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.690
are chosen are executed
in the proper order.
