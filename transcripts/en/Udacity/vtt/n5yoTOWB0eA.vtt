00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.560
There are two basic approaches to congestion control.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.434
End-to-end congestion control and network assisted congested control.

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:09.698
In end-to-end congestion control the network provides no

00:00:09.698 --> 00:00:12.322
explicit feedback to the senders about when they

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:15.996
should slow down their rates. Instead, congestion is

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:19.230
inferred typically by packet loss, but potentially also

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.760
by increased delay. This is the approach taken

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.990
by TCP congestion control. In network assisted congestion control

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.805
routers provide explicit feedback about the rates that

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:32.140
end systems should be sending in. So they

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.680
might set a single bit indicating congestion, as

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.950
is the case in TCP's ECN or explicit

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.770
congestion notification extensions, or they might even tell

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.480
the sender an explicit rate that they should

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.587
be sending at. We're going to spend the

00:00:46.587 --> 00:00:49.390
rest of the lesson talking about TCP congestion control.
