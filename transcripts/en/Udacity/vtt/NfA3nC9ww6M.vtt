00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.390
So let's look at what's actually happening here to our two curves on this

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.262
coordinate plane, to create this black line over here. What I've drawn right

00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:13.530
now, is a bunch of lines going from the x axis up to our curve. Or our line,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.035
rather, f of x. What happens graphically when we want to add 3 to the length of

00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:23.376
each of these lines, is that we're shifting them up. So that they start,

00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:27.618
instead, at the line, y equals 3. If we connect these lines now, we end up with

00:00:27.618 --> 00:00:32.311
a curve that looks just like our black line. Over there. So this line is

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.784
identical to the reddish one, just with every single point translated up 3

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:40.188
units. This is exactly what we were talking about with transformations in the

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:43.800
last lesson. Working with the same two functions as the last quiz, what if we

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.005
want to subtract one of these functions from the other? One of these three

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:53.930
graphs represents f minus g of x, and another one of them is g minus f of x.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.640
Which one is which? In this top row of bubbles, please select f minus g. And in

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.136
the bottom row, please pick which one is g minus f. I wanted to keep the

00:01:02.136 --> 00:01:05.597
functions written here for you. I'd recommend thinking about this graphically,

00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:08.369
but if you need to work with the equations of the functions, and combine them

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.719
mathematically first, before you pick the graphs, that's also totally fine.
