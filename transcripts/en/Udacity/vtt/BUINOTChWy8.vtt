00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.826
The answer is that the running
time is order M times K.

00:00:03.826 --> 00:00:05.590
There are no tricks about that.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.770
These are simple iterated for loops.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.060
Now at first this bound might seem
to suggest that subset sum is in P.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.330
But no, this number K takes
only log K bits to represent.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.120
So this number K is exponential
in the input length.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.150
And therefore this is
an exponential algorithm.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.770
Because it's exponential nature
comes from something that is

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.290
a simple parameter to the problem,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.160
like K, algorithms of this sort
are sometimes called pseudo polynomial.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.220
As we'll see however,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.254
subset sum is still in P complete
because we can reduce three.
