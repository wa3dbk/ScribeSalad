00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.180
Now returning to our look inside the black box, notice how we have multiple

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.950
operating systems running on the same shared

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.630
hardware resources. Now how is this possible?

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.480
How are the operating systems protected from one another, and who decides

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.110
who gets the resource and at what time? What we need then is an operating system

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.950
of operating systems. Something called a

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.340
virtual machine manager or hypervisor. The terminology

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.860
that you will often encounter is either VMM, which stands for virtual machine

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.820
monitor or hypervisor. And these operating systems that are running on top of

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.630
the shared hardware resources are often referred to as virtual machines, or VM

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.960
for short. We've always been using the term VM to mean virtual memory. You have

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.680
to do a, a mind shift for this lesson module, VM means virtual machine.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.060
And each of these operating systems that

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.150
run on top of the shared hardware resource,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.230
I'll often refer to them as either

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.310
guest operating systems or virtual machines or VM

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.220
for short. So watch out. Now, I should point out that there are two types of

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.690
hypervisors. The first type is what is called a native hypervisor or bare

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.270
metal, meaning that the hypervisor is running

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.040
on top of the bare hardware. And that's

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.826
why it's called a bare-metal hypervisor or

00:01:38.826 --> 00:01:42.530
a native hypervisor. And all of the operating

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.300
systems that I'm showing you inside of the black box are running on top of this

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.940
hypervisor. They're called the guest operating systems because they're the guest

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.910
of the hypervisor running on the shared resource. The second

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.170
type of hypervisor, what is called the hosted hypervisor, the hosted

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.110
ones run on top of a host operating system and allows

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.530
the users to emulate the functionality of other operating systems. So the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.690
hosted hypervisor is not running on top of the bare metal, but it is running as

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.320
an application process on top of the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.980
host operating system. And the guest operating

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.650
systems are [UNKNOWN] clients of this hosted

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.310
hypervisor. Some examples of hosted hypervisors include

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.020
VMware, Workstation, and Virtual Box. Both of

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.300
these terminologies you may have heard of. If

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.420
you don't have access to a computer

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.810
that's running Linux operating system in this course

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.620
you're likely to be doing your course projects on a virtual box or a VMWare

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.930
workstation that's available to run on Windows

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.610
platform. For the purpose of this lesson today,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.630
however, we will be focusing on the bare metal hypervisors. These bare

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.160
metal hypervisors interfere minimally with the

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.050
normal operation of these guest operating systems

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.720
on the shared resources in a spirit which is very similar to the extensible

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.750
operating systems that we studied earlier, like the spin and exokernel and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.180
therefore the bare metal hypervisors, offer the best performance

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.380
for the guest operating system on the shared resource.
