In lesson three, we studied
the Indiana Health Information Exchange,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.240
as the premiere example of centralized
health information exchange in the US.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.720
PopHealth is designed to deal with
the reality in most other places,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.990
where there may not even
be an HIE in place.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.420
You'd expect that IHIE could do more
with their more facile access to data,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.940
and they do.
