00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.650
It's hard to cover everything you need
to do to launch an app in one lesson.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.342
But there are few main points want
you to take away from this lesson.

00:00:07.342 --> 00:00:12.570
Your launch is one exciting day but
actually you launch new things

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.870
all the time you'll be irritating,
experimenting on learning new things.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.360
You want to be ready with all
the things for your launch but

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.356
to be experimenting with new
things once you do launch.

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:25.180
&gt;&gt; Don't try to out smart
the search engine or

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.320
the reporters who you are trying to
get to do press coverage for your app.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.320
Do what makes sense and
do what's relevant for your users.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.130
Your much more likely to
find success that way.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.770
And don't ignore user feedback or
reviews.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.430
It's not only going to help
you improve your product but

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.690
it'll also help you optimize
your app store performance.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.840
&gt;&gt; We look forward to seeing you
next lesson when we talk about

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.680
online marketing.
