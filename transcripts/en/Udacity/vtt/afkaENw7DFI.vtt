00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.150
We need to make this program read data from a file and compute the largest one.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.105
We make a file object for the file with name input.text. With that file object

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:12.800
we construct a scanner. And now the rest is exactly like what we had before,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.192
because reading from a scanner that is attached to a file Is no different than

00:00:16.192 --> 00:00:22.085
using a scanner that's attached to the console. So here, here, and here we call

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:27.898
next double, and has next double in the usual way. When you run this program,

00:00:27.898 --> 00:00:33.770
it'll tell you that it found, as its largest value, a value that is very large.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.186
Let's have a peek at the input file. That file has a lot of numbers in it that

00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:40.966
seem kind of meaningless. You'll see in the next exercise with Sara where they

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:41.830
come from.
