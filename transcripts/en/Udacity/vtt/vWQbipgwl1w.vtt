00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now here we have below a code from Wikipedia that does the same thing.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And I'm not going to go through the logic here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
But what you can see is this is quite a bit more idiomatic Python.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's actually quite a bit nicer than the code that I wrote.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So if you like that better then use this as a model instead of the code that I wrote.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The code that I wrote is pretty kind of dumb and obvious.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We have equivalently a Luhn valid check sum using the Wikipedia algorithm,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which just does the obvious thing.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And then what I have here is a random tester, which generates a random credit card number

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
with a certain prefix and 15 digits and then ensures is that it's valid.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The validity checking function for credit card numbers simply makes sure

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that it has the right length, that it has the right prefix, and that the checksum comes out to be 0.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That is to say, the is-Luhn-valid function returns true. So that's all there is to it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But what I want to do finally is take a look at one other issue.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm going to comment out my code here and comment in some different code.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What we're doing here is generating completely random 15-digit numbers.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What I'm doing is generating a random integer between 0 and the smallest 16-digit number.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The largest number that could be generated here is the largest 15-digit number.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And then we're going to zero-fill, convert that to a string, and do a zero-fill operation,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which adds leading zeros.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Now we have a completely random number that is 15 digits long.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And if that checks out to be a valid credit card number,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we're going to increment our validity checker and then finally after doing this 100 thousand times

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
we're going to print the number of valid credit card numbers that we got.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So let's run this and see what happens. Okay.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We got no valid credit card numbers out of 100 thousand.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So the problem is the prefix was too long.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
With a 6-digit prefix, the chance is one in a million that we'll generate just this prefix

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and then it goes down to one in 10 million that will meet the prefix and the checksum requirement.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So if we start off with a much smaller prefix like just 37 and this is basically anything

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
in the American Express system I think, now let's see what happens.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We're going to generate 100 thousand credit card numbers and 104 of them came out to be valid.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So even with just a two-digit prefix, it's pretty unlikely that we generate valid credit card numbers.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And so what that means is if we're generating lots of invalid credit card numbers

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
of course we're stressing only a very small bit of a transaction processing logic

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that checks for valid credit card numbers and we're not stressing the rest of it.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So what I hoped I accomplished here is first of all motivated the fact that this generation of valid data

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
is a real one and second of all, to give you a little bit of a feel for what code looks like

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that we usually have to write to generate valid inputs.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And so, if we go back to our web browser example, you can see that we will be doing a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
similar exercise but it'd just be quite a bit more sophisticated to generate

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
for example a valid HTML or a valid HTML with scripts and other things.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
That it would take to actually do meaningful fuzzing of a web browser as shown by the blue line here.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And so now to do this, instead of spending half an hour or however long you spend

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
on the PR quiz now maybe you're going to be spending many weeks.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But on the other hand, what we're going to get out of this if we do it right

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
is a lot of high-value bugs including security bugs in our web browser and strongly possible

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
but of course not guaranteed that the value we get out of those bugs

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that we find in a web browser but the effort would've been worth it.
