00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.966
The answer is, we want to set inside vowel group to false when letter is not a

00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:09.254
vowel. If we always increment count for vowels, then words like peach would be

00:00:09.254 --> 00:00:14.183
counted as having two syllables. These two vowels, e and a, are in the same

00:00:14.183 --> 00:00:19.286
vowel group. So even though there are two, we only want one syllable. If we

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:22.324
change the condition of the inner if block from inside vowel group to count

00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:25.607
equals equals one, Will only increment count when there's already one syllable

00:00:25.607 --> 00:00:32.070
counted. So we'll never increment count. If we set inside vowel group to false

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.065
right after count++, we'll never be inside of a vowel group. Every vowel would

00:00:37.065 --> 00:00:41.128
be counted as a syllable, so this would be a lot like the first option. It

00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:45.625
wouldn't work well for words that have two vowels together. The last answer is

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:50.960
the correct one. When we see a non-vowel, we want to change insideVowelGroup to

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.760
false. For example, in hello, we see the e and enter a vowel group, but then we

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.160
see an l, so that ends the vowel group.
