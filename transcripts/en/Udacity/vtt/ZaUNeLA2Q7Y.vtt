00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.480
So a couple that I came up with are work ethic,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.290
which can be kind of hard to categorize between learned and

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.240
innate. Cancer can sometimes be difficult to know if it's visible

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.560
or hidden, right, it depends on which level we're talking about

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.880
at the cellular or the total body level. Then you have

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.410
something like aggression, which can be hard to define as behavioral

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.480
or physical. That may be behavior you show, but the outcome

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.560
is physical, and so it might be how we quantify it.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.270
Here's actually a word cloud of student responses

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.780
that you and your fellow classmates submitted. Remember that

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.400
in a word cloud, the bigger the word,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.940
the more it was submitted by your fellow students

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.160
as a trait that's difficult to distinguish in

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.880
one of our three categories here. Look around the

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.150
list and see if you agree if some of

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.000
these traits are difficult to define in these categories.
