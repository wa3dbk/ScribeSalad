00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.580
I'm Katherine Kwan, 
and I'm a developer advocate at Google.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.310
I started off by working as an engineer 
on the Android apps team.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.170
I worked there for three years on 
products like Google Play and Google Keep,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.906
the note taking app.
I'm continually blown away

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:19.442
by what you can build on this platform,

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:23.048
and I'm particularly inspired 
by those apps that can truly improve

00:00:23.048 --> 00:00:24.624
people's lives.

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:27.950
When I meet people, they often tell me
about their great app ideas.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.870
But then they feel like they don't have 
the technical skills to actually build it.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.860
And that's why I shifted over 
to developer relations

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.278
so I can help people like you 
really build something great.

00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:43.428
Throughout this course, I'll be helping 
you implement your very first app.

00:00:48.544 --> 00:00:52.170
My name is Dan Gauthan. 
I've been a developer advocate at Google

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.320
for four years and I've worn 
a lot of hats here.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.440
My goal is to keep us on track 
to make Sunshine, something that

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.930
had some resemblance 
to a production quality app.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.658
I'll introduce Android design 
patterns and principles.

00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:06.386
Many of which are often missed 
by new Android developers.

00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:10.304
You'll learn to lean on the framework, 
focusing on what makes your app unique

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.362
instead of reinventing the wheel.

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:21.033
I'm Rado Mya, and I've been a developer 
advocate for Android at Google

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.714
for five years.

00:01:22.714 --> 00:01:25.526
I started working on Androids 
so long ago that back then

00:01:25.526 --> 00:01:27.782
there were no devices.

00:01:27.782 --> 00:01:30.940
All we had to work with 
were an emulator, a beater SDK,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.060
and an almost fanatical devotion 
to the platform.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.290
I'll be joining you from here, 
my underground Android developer bunker,

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.563
and my goal isn't to get you up 
and running as quickly as possible.

00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:44.465
It's to teach you the context behind
the choices we'll make.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:47.840
And the best practices you need, 
to really understand how to create

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.675
great experiences specifically 
tailored to mobile devices.

00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:55.383
By the time you finished this course 
you'll know more than just how to create

00:01:55.383 --> 00:01:56.370
yet another app.

00:01:56.373 --> 00:02:00.000
You'll know how to build 
great apps that focus on the user.
