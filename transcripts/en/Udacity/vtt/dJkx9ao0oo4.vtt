00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.724
Let's look at two different functions now, but still nothing too complicated. I

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:10.238
like these two. Here we have p of x, equals x plus 4. And q of x, equals

00:00:10.238 --> 00:00:16.370
negative 2x minus 5. So here are three graphs. Which one represents p plus q,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.009
which one is p minus q, and which one shows q minus p? Now to figure this out,

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.608
think about how much each line should be moved up or down at each x value,

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:31.489
based on the value of the other function at that same position. Another way, of

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.881
course, to figure this question out, will be to use the equations right here,

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:39.703
of p and q, to figure out the equations of the other lines. Then you can use

00:00:39.703 --> 00:00:41.199
those to pick the graphs.
