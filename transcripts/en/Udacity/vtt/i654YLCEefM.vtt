00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.210
So as a quick quiz, which aspects of DNS make it vulnerable

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.420
to attack? The fact that queries are sent over UDP. The fact that

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.530
DNS names are human-readable. The fact that responses to DNS queries are

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.710
not authenticated? Or, that the DNS

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.803
is distributed or federated over many organizations?
