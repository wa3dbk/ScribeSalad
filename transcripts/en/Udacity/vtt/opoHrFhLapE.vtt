00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.766
Here are the correct answers. Fantastic work if you got at least one of those

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:07.145
correct. If either of these problems are giving you trouble, then watch the

00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:11.087
solution and we'll figure it out together. To add these two fractions together,

00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:16.605
we simply add the numerators. 3 n and 2 n equal 5 n. We leave the denominator

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:20.840
alone, so we have 5 n divided by 11. This problem is exactly like the one we saw

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.565
before. It's just we needed to combine the like terms and our numerator first.

00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:28.906
For the second problem, we want to add the numerators a and b together, and keep

00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:34.240
the denominator the same. Since we have a plus b divided by a plus b, we know

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.448
those reduce to 1. And finally, for this third one, we want to subtract a y from

00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:45.906
this numerator. So we'll have 2 y minus 1 minus 1 y, we subtract the like terms

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:51.080
to get y minus 1 for our numerator. Now we want to factor our denominator to see

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.304
if it can reduce with our numerator since our numerator has changed and it turns

00:00:55.304 --> 00:00:59.960
out that's a great move because we can factor and reduce and equivalence of 1. Y

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.754
minus 1 divided by y minus 1 equals 1. This leaves us with the answer of 1

00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:09.944
divided by y plus 2. If you got the first two, excellent work, and I know this

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:11.843
one might of given you some trouble.
