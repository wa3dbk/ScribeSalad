00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, that we have the mechanical idea behind the SEIR model, turn that into a set of equations.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For each term that may appear in these equations,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
enter the corresponding letter into one of these boxes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Leave that box empty if it's not needed. 1/1 day, 1/5 days, 5*10⁻⁹ per day and person,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the number of susceptible persons, the number of exposed persons, the number of infectious persons,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the number of recovered persons, the product of the numbers of infectious and susceptible persons,

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and the product of the number of exposed and infectious persons.
