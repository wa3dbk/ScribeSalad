Great factoring skills if you got this correct. We can factor a 3x from the

00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:09.596
first two terms. We'll have 3x times the quantity 4x minus 3. I've been saying

00:00:09.596 --> 00:00:14.486
this word quantity a lot and I use it when I really talk about the parentheses.

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:18.946
I have 3x times some quantity 4x minus 3. If we distribute the 3x to 4x and

00:00:18.946 --> 00:00:23.476
minus 3, we wind up with what we started with. So this is correct factoring.

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:27.992
Next, I can see that negative 8x and 6 share a factor of 2. This would leave me

00:00:27.992 --> 00:00:32.671
with negative 4x plus 3 in the second parentheses. You might have gotten stuck

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:37.341
here and that's okay. We notice that this first parentheses and the second

00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:42.398
parentheses aren't the same. The 4x is positive and this is negative. The 3 is

00:00:42.398 --> 00:00:47.271
negative, but this 3 is positive. Well, instead of taking out a positive 2,

00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:52.017
let's take out a negative 2. If we factor out a negative 2 from negative 8x,

00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:56.767
we're left with positive 4x. And if we factor a negative 2 from positive 6,

00:00:56.767 --> 00:01:02.066
we're left with negative 3. Finally, we factor out the 4x minus 3 from the first

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:07.380
term and the second term. This leaves us with 3x minus 2 times 4x minus 3. You

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.206
could have either have written your answer like this or like this. Both are

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:12.875
correct.
