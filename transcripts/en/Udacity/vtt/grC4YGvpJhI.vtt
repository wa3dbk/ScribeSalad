00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.839
Another problem with using objects for

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.380
components is known as The Fragile Base Class problem.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.522
This occurs when a new version of a component changes one of,

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:10.030
of its base classes.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.080
Our existing derived class is broken.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.680
Imagine you've been using an object-like component by deriving from one of

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.150
its base classes.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.200
Now your component vendor says that the new release of the component has

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.890
changed the base class.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.930
Can you continue to run?

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.510
Do you have to recompile?

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.040
Do you, do you have to rewrite?
