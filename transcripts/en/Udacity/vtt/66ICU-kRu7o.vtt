00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880
Now I'm going to draw a very similar--well, in a way very similar network for independent set.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.550
At least, I'm going to place the vertices at the same locations and we'll just how similar they are.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.670
And now, we're going to use similar quiz and this time, I would like you to check all vertices

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.270
not that belong to the largest clique but to the largest independent set.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.030
Then you can make your check marks on each of the vertices

00:00:23.030 --> 99:59:59.000
that you think belong to the largest independent set.
