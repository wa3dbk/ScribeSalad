00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.080
As we discussed, virtual networks can facilitate research

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.980
in evolution by allowing experimental networks to coexist

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.020
with production networks. Because the networks are virtual,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.730
they can be scaled up and down adjusting the

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.410
resources that are devoted to any one particular

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.980
service as demands change. We discuss this in the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.730
context of production networks, such as Google and

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.410
Yahoo. Virtual networks are not inherently easier to troubleshoot,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.170
nor do they necessarily provide better

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.950
forwarding performance. In fact, forwarding performance may

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.130
be worse, due to the additional level of indirection that has been added.
