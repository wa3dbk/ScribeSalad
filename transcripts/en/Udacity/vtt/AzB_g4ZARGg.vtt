00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.110
Well, the way we constructed this graph or the way that I first construct it--well of course as follows

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.990
that we made the greedy algorithm take all vertices into the vertex cover except for those 24 here.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.890
So every vertex except for those that are actually in a minimum vertex cover.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.200
So how many are there.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.710
Well, up here we have 11, then we have an additional 14 here, then we have 12 here,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.130
8 here, and 12 here, and that is a total of 57 vertices

00:00:31.130 --> 99:59:59.000
as opposed to a minimum vertex cover, which is 24.
