00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.230
So what have I drawn down here?

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.120
So what I've drawn is an MDP and a
particular trajectory through that MDP.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.670
So here are the dots or
states and the little lines

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.260
are sort of the actions that you took
to move between those states, and

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.980
whatever awards you happen
to pick up along the way.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.580
So I'm in some MDP,
a Markov decision process and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.688
I am moving through states taking
actions and receiving rewards.

00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:27.830
And I'm sort of moving through that, and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.850
that's kind of what we've been
thinking about before, right?

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.580
This is what the Bellman
equation sort of captures for us.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.378
We're going to be in a state, take
an action, end up in the next state,

00:00:35.378 --> 00:00:36.410
maybe getting rewards.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.510
I should accumulate all that and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.650
use that to update my estimate of the
value of being in a particular state.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.870
Right, that all sound familiar?

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.101
&gt;&gt; That is a diagram of SAR,
SAR, SAR, SAR, SAR.

00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:48.855
&gt;&gt; Right this is SAR, SAR, SAR,
SAR, SAR, SAR, SAR, SAR, SAR,

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:50.290
SAR, forever and ever.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.280
Now we know how this works.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.072
One of us, probably both of us at some
point or another, actually started

00:00:56.072 --> 00:01:00.450
explaining the math behind here and
how you would back up values and why.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.900
This is a way to do learning.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.310
But in this space where we have
these temporal abstractions,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.420
we have these options.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.930
We're actually violating everything
that we know about MDPs.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.740
And I think it helps there to draw
a slightly different picture.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.990
So because we have these
temporally abstract options,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.579
we are not having very
simple time steps, right?

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.640
So here, kind of implicit in this,
is we're in state,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.335
we take an action, and
then we're in another state.

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:27.240
We're in a state, we take an action,
we're in another state, so on and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.110
so forth.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.546
And how much time passes between
visiting each of these states, Michael?

00:01:32.546 --> 00:01:35.460
&gt;&gt; I'm going to call it one time step.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.420
&gt;&gt; One time step,
which I'm going to claim,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.430
you may not agree with this, might as
well be the same thing as 0 time stamps.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.870
In some sense, we treat the actions in
an MDP as if they are instantaneous.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.070
And perhaps, to drag on more of
the computer science analogy,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.860
we treat them as if they are atomic.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.396
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm along with you for
the atomic idea.

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:57.640
I definitely am not along with you in
the it takes 0 time idea, but I guess,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.370
your time in the sense that there's no,
I don't know, there's no crack in it.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.950
There's no window that
anything else can jump in, and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.260
that's really the idea of atomic,
so I think we agree.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we do agree.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.184
You're basically, we're picking
constants, you want to call it 1,

00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:12.360
I want to call it 0.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.620
We can both go with that.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.270
&gt;&gt; But that's like me saying T and
F are the same thing.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.780
0 and 1 are not the same thing.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.359
&gt;&gt; They're the same
thing within a constant.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.320
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not
a multiplicative constant.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.550
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Fair enough.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.351
But the point here is that,
in some sense, atomic, instantaneous,

00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:30.009
what really is happening here,
I was in a state, I took an action,

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:31.290
I end up in another state.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.130
Nothing else can happen.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.550
We treat that time stamp.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.940
It may be a year, it may be a day,
but whatever it is,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.080
we treat them all as if they're
the same and we're just moving along.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.220
In fact, we talk about time steps.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.670
And implicit, I think, in the way
we've been talking about time steps so

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.600
far is that they're all the same length,
whatever they are,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.090
which is why you can call
them 1 as opposed to 7.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.880
It doesn't really matter.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.130
The fact is that I take this,

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.500
there's an atomic action taken,
I end up somewhere else.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.150
Nothing else happens in the middle.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.610
I can reason about everything.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.692
By contrast,
once we have these options, I mean,

00:03:01.692 --> 00:03:03.790
think about this picture up here.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.190
Think about the upper northeast room.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.460
If I'm in this little pink state here,

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.450
I just entered into the room, I'm
going to get from here, the east door,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.372
to the south door in some
amount of time, right.

00:03:18.372 --> 00:03:20.570
It's going to be made
up of atomic actions,

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.800
because all I really have is up,
down, left and right.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.570
And I don't know how long
that's going to take.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.790
Let's say it takes 50 time steps,
it doesn't really matter.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.160
It's going to take the same
number of time steps.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.190
But if I'm in this little space
down here near the bottom,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.710
already near the door,
that's going to take fewer time steps.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.960
So what I'm actually seeing,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.700
with respect to the underlying MDP,
is I start in some state.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.090
I take one of these options,
some amount of time passes,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.620
often more than the single time step,
and then I end up in another state.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.573
And then I take another option, end up
in another state, take another option,

00:03:51.573 --> 00:03:54.660
I end up in another state,
and so on and so forth.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.290
And the amount of time that I spend in
each option is variable, potentially.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.360
And is not necessarily the same as
the atomic actions that we had before.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.010
&gt;&gt; Interesting, okay,
so variable time steps.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.380
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.730
&gt;&gt; So does that mess up everything?

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.930
&gt;&gt; It does,
because if you think about the way

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.990
Bellman works is it assumes a discount
that happens at every time step and

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.829
it accumulates
information along the way.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.710
So we need to have a way
to capture all of that,

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.300
that allows us to get all of
the neat little features of an MDP,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.980
while still allowing us to use
these variable time actions.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.990
It turns out that's pretty
straightforward to do.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.650
I'll just write out the equations for
you and hopefully, it'll be easy to see.
