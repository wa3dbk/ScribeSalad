00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.276
To figure out what each of the terms should become inside the parentheses, we

00:00:03.276 --> 00:00:08.000
just need to divide each of them by x, since we've written our factor up here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.368
Now our function reads f of x equals x times the quantity 2x cubed minus 13x

00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:17.162
squared plus 32x minus 13.
