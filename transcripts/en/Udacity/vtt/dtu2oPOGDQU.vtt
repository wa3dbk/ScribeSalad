00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.927
For the first expression, we can switch the terms in the denominator, since

00:00:03.927 --> 00:00:08.588
addition is commutative. So we'll have x plus 7 divided by the quantity x plus

00:00:08.588 --> 00:00:13.587
7. These expressions are identical, so we're really left with positive 1. For

00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:17.986
the second rational expression, we know it equals negative 1. This b squared is

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:23.938
positive and this b squared is negative, whereas this 5 is negative and this 5

00:00:23.938 --> 00:00:29.330
is positive. So, we definitely have opposite polynomials. We see that here, if

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.295
we just reverse the terms of the denominator and keep the signs in front of

00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:38.232
them. We factor a negative 1 from the denominator and then the b squared minus

00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:42.604
5s can cancel. This leaves us with negative 1. For this third one, you might

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:46.768
have thought it was negative 1. You might have cancelled the terms which are a

00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:51.066
and then simplified negative 5 over positive 5. But, remember, we can't cancel

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:55.998
terms. We can only cancel factors. A is positive in the numerator and positive

00:00:55.998 --> 00:01:00.288
in the denominator, so, these aren't opposite polynomials. The 5s have different

00:01:00.288 --> 00:01:05.242
signs which mean this polynomial can't equal positive 1. It must be something

00:01:05.242 --> 00:01:09.518
else. And for the last one, we could switch the terms in the denominator, and

00:01:09.518 --> 00:01:14.242
then, factor a negative 1 from the numerator. The common factors of 2x minus 9

00:01:14.242 --> 00:01:19.060
simplify to 1, leaving us with negative 1 as our result. Great work if you even

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.983
got two of those correct. These were pretty tough.
