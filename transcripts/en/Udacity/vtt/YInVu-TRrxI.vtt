00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.457
So again, in order to figure out how to evaluate each of these expressions, we

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:08.864
need to use our order of operations knowledge. We need to remember our PEMDAS.

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:13.069
For this first problem, negative 2 to the third power, we don't have any

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:17.602
parentheses, so that means we need to take the exponent into account before the

00:00:17.614 --> 00:00:21.958
negative sign. So we have negative 1 times 2 to the third power, which is the

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.199
same as negative 1 times 8. So we get negative 8. The next problem has some

00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:30.467
parethesis in it, so we need to deal with what's inside of those first. And

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.987
inside we have negative 2 squared. Just like in this first problem, you need to

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:39.495
do the exponent before the negative sign. So what's inside the parethesis here,

00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:44.108
is negative 4, since we have negative 2 squared, which is negative 4. So this

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.473
equals 2 times negative 4 which is just negative 8 again. For the third problem,

00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:52.838
we have an exponent outside of something that is inside of parentheses. SO we

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.984
know the negative sign is going to be part of the number that is taken to the

00:00:56.996 --> 00:01:01.252
exponent, so the entire quantity negative 2 is squared. So this is equal to 2

00:01:01.264 --> 00:01:05.643
times negative 2 times negative 2. Which is the same as 2 times positive 4,

00:01:05.748 --> 00:01:10.488
which is positive 8. Again we have a negative sign inside the parenthesis. So

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.061
it's part of this number that is taken to the 3rd power. So negative 2 times

00:01:15.073 --> 00:01:19.924
negative 2 times negative 2 is negative 8. Here the negative sign comes outside

00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:24.590
the parenthesis. So you have negative 1 times positive 2 to the 3rd, 2 to the

00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:29.850
3rd is 8. And negative 1 times 8 is negative 8. Our last two problems, both fall

00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:35.150
into the neither category. 2 plus 2 squared, is just equal to 2 plus 4, which is

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:40.125
6. Which is not equal to either 8 or negative 8. And here we have negative 2

00:01:40.137 --> 00:01:45.425
squared plus 2 squared. Since there's not a parenthesis around this negative 2,

00:01:45.537 --> 00:01:50.767
we know that we need to square 2 before multiplying it by negative 1. So this is

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:54.590
actually equal to negative 4 plus 4, and that's equal to 0. Great job, I know

00:01:54.602 --> 00:01:58.359
this a lot to do in 1 quiz, but I think that having to thi nk through all these

00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:02.244
different options that are sort of similar to each other could be a really good

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:06.046
way to make sure you have your order of operations sense cemented. And if you

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:09.923
don't, not a big deal at all. Remember, just go back and practice a little bit

00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:10.163
more.
