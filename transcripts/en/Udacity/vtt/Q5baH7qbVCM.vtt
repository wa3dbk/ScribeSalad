00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.300
So an obvious better idea is just
what's referred to as Mean filtering.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.460
Mean is my background now,
instead of just being the last frame,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.880
which is really silly is just going to
be the average of the last end frames.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.580
That's what it says here.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.070
And my background at time t,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.990
is just the average of the sum
of n frames in the past.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.625
Okay?

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:23.386
In which case then my background my, my,
my mask is now I take my current image

00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:27.610
subtract off that mean and
that is greater than the threshold.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.210
Notice we now have a new parameter,
right?

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.875
We now have this parameter n.

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:33.650
We have to worry about
how much do we average?

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.083
So here's an example on the same
scene of using n as n equal 10.

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:40.440
All right, so it's average.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.610
Now you'll see, it's,
it's kind of a weird thing, right.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.760
So this, this van that has you're
kind of blended in there, right?

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.480
As it averages over different places and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.980
my Foreground mask looks
kind of like this, all right?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.390
And so I'm getting this
extension of the cars in,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.410
in a variety of ways and
it's not so great.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.940
And the reason that it's not so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.330
great is that the average isn't
really the right thing, right?

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.400
So averaging over all those vans

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.710
is getting me this kind of weird thing,
right.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.090
Now of course if I averaged over 50, you
know, but then I'd have all these other

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.180
cars coming through,
the average is very sensitive to this.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.880
What you can think of is that, the
background is just sort of a constant

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.060
value, with maybe a little variation and

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.090
occasionally, I get some
random perturbation, right?

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.630
Some random noise comes along.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.080
We've seen this before.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.290
Remember when we were doing
noise filtering of images?

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.290
And we were using Gaussians, etc.,
and then we put in that like salt and

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.280
pepper noise.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.550
And we said salt and pepper noise,
the problem with it is every now and

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.380
then you get this big spike in there.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.000
And in average it'll get tweaked
around quite a bit by that.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.250
So what was the solution to that?

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.300
The solution to that
was to use a median.
