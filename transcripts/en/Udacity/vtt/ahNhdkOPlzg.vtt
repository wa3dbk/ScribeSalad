00:00:00.121 --> 00:00:05.137
Suppose that a sender is sending at some rate r, which is bigger than

00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:10.417
the sustained rate R that they are allowed to be sending it, and suppose

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:15.319
that our bucket size is beta. Then, how long can a sender

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:20.690
send at the rate r that exceeds the sustained rate?

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.480
In other words, what is the value of d? We know that

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.876
the bucket size, beta, as shown in the shaded green area, is

00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:38.870
simply d times r minus the sustained rate R. So sender can send at the rate,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.574
little r, that exceeds the sustained rate, R, 4 beta divided by r minus

00:00:44.574 --> 00:00:49.730
R sustained. Now based on what we've learned here, let's just take a quick quiz.
