00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.810
So far we've seen two
complex types in Python.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.780
We've seen the string type and
we've seen the list type.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.920
Now, we're going to introduce
the dictionary type.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.880
So there are many things that
are common between these three.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.410
There are other things
that are different.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.420
So to create a string we could have
a sequence of characters inside quotes.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.630
To create a list we use
the square bracket, and

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.080
we can have a sequence of elements
inside the square bracket.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.680
And the elements could be any type,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.260
unlike a string where they
had to be characters.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.500
So our string was
a sequence of characters.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.406
Our list was a list of
any kind of value, so

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:39.460
a list of elements of any value.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.050
The dictionary type.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.940
We're going to create
using the curly bracket.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.960
And the entries inside
a dictionary are key value pairs.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.992
So here, I've created a dictionary
with two elements, and

00:00:50.992 --> 00:00:53.060
each element, the key is a string.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.960
Here's the string hydrogen, and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.450
the value associated with that element,
is the number.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.170
The keys in a dictionary can be any
immutable value, so they don't need to

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.379
be strings, they could be numbers,
they could be other things.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.840
The values can be any value.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.780
So what a dictionary is,
is that set of key, value pairs.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.540
And the property that a dictionary
will give us is like the hash table,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.510
that we can look up a key and
get the value associated with that key.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.190
So one important property of all types
is whether they're immutable or mutable.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.930
We saw that the string was immutable,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.260
that means once we create a string,
we can't modify that string.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.290
It has the same value, it always has.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.050
A list was mutable, we can change
the values of elements in a list.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.170
After we create the list,
we could append to the list,

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.450
adding new elements to it.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.500
A dictionary is also mutable.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.490
So after we create a dictionary,
we could add new key value pairs to it.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.390
We could change the value of
values associated with keys.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.820
We saw with strings, if s is a string,
then we can do s index i.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.990
That will give us the ith letter and
string.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.900
With list,
we can do something very similar.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.449
If p is a list, we can do p index i,
to get the ith element of the list.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.935
With dictionaries it's
a little bit different.

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:14.890
The syntax is the same,
we can do d index k.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.730
With both strings and lists.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.030
These were numbers.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.810
Here the k is whatever the key value is.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.960
So this is a key in the dictionary.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.520
What d index k will give us
the value associated with that key

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.570
in the dictionary.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.110
We'll see some examples soon.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.000
We can also use our indexing and
assignments.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.800
We saw with the list we could do this.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.980
That would replace the value of the ith
element of p with whatever we have here.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.400
With the string, we can't do that.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.960
That produces an error.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.890
And the reason we can't do it,
is because strings are immutable, so

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.900
there's no way to modify
characters in a string.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.230
With the dictionary, we can,
and what the meaning of this,

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.700
is very similar to the meaning
of update in our hash table, so

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.230
that's equivalent to update the value,
the value associated with k to be v.
