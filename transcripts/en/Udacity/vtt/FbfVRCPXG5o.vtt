00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.760
I've created a simple template here,
and called it menu.html.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.890
A copy of it,
is available in the instructor notes.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:06.720
Take a look at it, and

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.890
see if you can figure out,
how Flask accommodates for escape code?

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.920
You should see a few symbols here,
that don't look like HTML.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.230
Try and see if you can figure out,
what each one of them does.
