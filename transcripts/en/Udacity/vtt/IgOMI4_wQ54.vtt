00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.570
This recipe has taken me
years to perfect, and

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.263
I think it's finally ready
to share with the world.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.091
I just published it in my brand new
cookbook, Cooking with @walterlatimer.

00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:14.613
[NOISE] So, what is a cookbook?

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:17.632
Well, a cookbook is a way
of documenting recipes,

00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:21.790
it helps us make sense of all the tools
and ingredients in the kitchen.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.350
Without this documentation, I might have
everything I need to make a delicious

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.630
meal but I wouldn't have any
idea how to put it all together.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.640
Technical documentation exists for
a similar purpose.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.860
To help us make sense of code.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.570
Without it,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.450
developers, you included, won't know
how to use other people's code.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.520
They might not even know how to run it.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.910
I read documentation for
all my projects, including this one.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.620
In the instructor notes, you can find
a link to the Read Me I created for

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.820
this course.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.500
There, you can find helpful
resources to help you along

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.460
as you work through this lesson.
