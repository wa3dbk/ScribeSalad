00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
So the first statement is clearly true, and we talked about this a couple of times

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.400
in this unit.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.350
If you know the state of the deterministic RAM,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.320
that means you know whats in the memory

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.160
and where the program is currently executing,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.500
then you can easily tell what the machine will do as a next step.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.230
The second one is of course not true,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.040
because we have the if-better function, and so

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.810
if we know the state of a non deterministic RAM at time point t,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.780
and at that point in time, we call the if-better function,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.110
then we can not say what the state will be

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.410
at time t plus 1.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.820
There are basically either the first part of the code is executed

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.260
or the second part of the code is executed.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.480
And this gives us the answer for

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.230
the last 3 statements here,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.510
so this one here is false, because a non deterministic RAM

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.470
does not behave like a deterministic RAM,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.940
but there is actually only one case where it does this,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.220
and that is when if-better is called,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.220
so this statement here is true,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.690
and when the if-better is called, there can not be any number of next states.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.240
There can only be 2,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.140
because you'll remember, the if-better function works as follows.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.090
You call if-better, then there's some code here,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.620
and then you have an else statement, and there's some code here.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.269
Then there's only 2 possibilities,

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.060
so it's not any number of states;

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.420
it is actually just 2,

00:01:08.420 --> 99:59:59.000
so this is also false.
