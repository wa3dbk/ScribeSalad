00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.609
In the last lesson, we looked at Motion Problems, by looking at the distance,

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:08.016
rate and times of different objects. We saw how fast some people could bike and

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:11.556
we saw how fast some things could travel. We're going to tackle a similar

00:00:11.556 --> 00:00:15.543
Motion Problem, this time it's going to involve a current. And in order to

00:00:15.543 --> 00:00:18.907
solve these problems involving current, we want to be clear on 2 words,

00:00:18.907 --> 00:00:23.453
upstream and downstream. If we think about swimming laps inside of a pool, I

00:00:23.453 --> 00:00:27.988
could say that my speed would be 5 miles per hour. That's about how fast I swim

00:00:27.988 --> 00:00:32.350
from each side of the pool. 5 miles per hour would be considered to be my speed

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.539
in still water, since there's no current pushing me forward or backward. I'm

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.386
just swimming along inside of a pool. But what if instead I went swimming in a

00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:45.642
river? A river has a current to it, so if i swim downstream I would be swimming

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:50.880
with the current. And if I swim upstream i would be going again the current. If

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.158
the speed of the current is 3 miles per hour. And I know that in still water I

00:00:55.158 --> 00:00:58.398
can swim 5 miles per hour, what would be my speed if I was traveling

00:00:58.398 --> 00:01:04.772
downstream? And, what would be my speed if I traveled upstream? Write those 2

00:01:04.772 --> 00:01:06.090
answers here.
