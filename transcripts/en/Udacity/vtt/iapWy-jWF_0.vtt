00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.969
So let's see how we can
actually compute that.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.560
Again remember, we are looking for
eight parameters.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.470
This is equal to 1 which
basically is a scale factor and

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.500
always known to be equal to one.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.320
We need to set up a system
of linear equations like so

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.670
where basically Is equal to b.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.850
And how would we do this?

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.900
Well, h is our unknowns.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.180
So basically what we
would need to know is,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.700
where is the vector of Nodes h is
basically all of the values a, b, c,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.770
d, e, f, g, h, the eight things,
and that's my vector.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.290
What would be the other two terms?

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.710
Well, basically we need eight equations.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.900
But more the better.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.370
So these are eight equations now.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.280
But if you had more of them, what,
how would we get more of them?

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.770
We actually can sample information
from the images ourselves.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.730
So, can actually compute all of this,
but what we want to do is,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.660
if we had more of them, we can
actually come up with better solution.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.210
So, we need to solve for h here.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.400
I need to know A, and I need to know b.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.160
And again those things are available
because I have the pair of images.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.220
And of, of course,
if it's an over-constraint,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.980
I can actually get more samples.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.060
What I can do basically is makes
this into a least squares solution,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.410
where basically I'll solve it for a lot
of information and of course look for

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.330
the minimum of the least
squares solution.
