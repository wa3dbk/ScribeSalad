00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.370
Let's talk about another popular
sorting algorithm called Merge Sort.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.900
The overall idea is that you split a
huge array down as much as possible and

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.670
then over time build it back
up doing your comparisons and

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.280
sorting at each step along the way.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.790
The general idea of breaking up an array
sorting all the parts of it and

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.549
then building it back up again
is called Divide and Conquer.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.250
Several efficient sorting algorithms
have this principle at their core.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.198
Okay, let's see how merge
sort works with an example.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.300
First we break up the array into a bunch
of arrays with one element each,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.160
now we need to start
building it back up again.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.269
You may wonder why the one leftover
element goes at the beginning and

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.460
not the end.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.580
Don't worry too much
about details like that.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.518
They’ll differ depending
on the implementation.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:57.330
However the step should only have
arrays of size two and size one left.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.610
First we compare these two elements
to see which one is smaller.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.929
Since one is smaller,
it'll go first in our new array and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.760
since 3 is bigger it'll go second.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.850
Now we move on and
do this with the next pair of arrays.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.509
Again 7 is bigger than 0.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.370
So in our new array we put 0 in
the first spot and 7 in the second spot.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.291
And now we do this one last time
comparing the last two elements 10 and

00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:27.229
2 and
putting them in order in a new array.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.940
Great that was easy enough.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.690
Now the last thing we want to do is keep
track of the number of comparisons we

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.500
did so we can come back to it when
we do our efficiency calculation

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.130
overall this step took 3
comparisons each one in green.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.230
Okay, we're running out of space, so

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.548
I'm going to clear everything off except
this bottom row and move it on up.

00:01:49.548 --> 00:01:54.530
Now we're going to combine
the first two arrays and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.380
the last two arrays and create an array
of three and an array of four.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.900
Now these comparisons
are a little more complicated.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.770
Here we're comparing an array with one
element to an array with two elements.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.450
We know that the array on
the right is already sorted so

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.399
the first element of our new array
is either going to come from here or

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.840
the first element of this array.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.179
It looks like one is smaller so
that will be our first element.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.260
Now we can move on to the next
element in this array and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.299
compare it with this one.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.300
Since 3 is smaller than 8
we'll put 3 in this box.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.160
Now that we're done with this array we
can just take anything that's left in

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.400
the other one and
tack it on the end here.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.680
Great, let's move on to
building this array.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.299
So we're going to start out comparing
the first two elements of these arrays,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.320
that's 0 and 2.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.124
Since 0 is less than 2, 0 becomes
the first element in our new array.

00:02:55.124 --> 00:03:01.670
Okay, so now we move on to the next
element in this array which is 7 and

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.825
compare that to 2.

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:04.886
2 is less than 7 so
we put 2 in the new array.

00:03:06.577 --> 00:03:09.257
We repeat again checking
7 against 10 and

00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:11.187
fill them in at the end
of the array accordingly.

00:03:12.867 --> 00:03:15.797
How many comparisons
did we do in the step?

00:03:15.797 --> 00:03:21.270
Well, if you count up all the purple
comparisons that leaves us with 5.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.487
Okay we're almost there.

00:03:22.487 --> 00:03:25.107
We just need to go through one
more round to get our completely

00:03:25.107 --> 00:03:25.767
sorted array.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.370
This is going to start just
like it did in the last round.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.400
We start off by comparing the first two
elements of the two arrays that we have,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.250
so 1 and 0.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.140
Since 0 is smaller it ends
up going in this array and

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.670
we get rid of it in the old array.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.399
We move on comparing 1 and 2 and
end up with one being smaller.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.571
So 1 fills in the spot.

00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:56.840
We compare again with 2 and
3 and again with 3 and 7.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.570
And again with 8 and 7.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.250
And finally we're done.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.730
We have our newly sorted array.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.970
We need to keep track of the number
of comparisons we did in this step.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.650
So I'll write 6 comparisons
off to the side here.
