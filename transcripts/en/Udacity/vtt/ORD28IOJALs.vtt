00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.822
On this interval of the domain, f of x is actually decreasing. So as you move

00:00:04.822 --> 00:00:09.442
from one x value to the right, increase in the value of x, the curve here is

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:14.228
dropping. The y values or rather the f of x values are decreasing as x values

00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:19.125
are increasing. So whenever a function is going down or has a negative slope we

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.713
say that it is decreasing on that interval of the domain.
