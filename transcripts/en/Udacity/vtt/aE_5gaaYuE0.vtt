00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.015
In this session we're going to
talk about a powerful data type

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:05.620
called enumerations,
or enums, for short.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.410
As developers, we can think of
enums as a type that can represent

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.090
any value in a set of related values.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.140
For example, North, South, East, and

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.600
West, these are values we could
represent with an enum called direction.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.150
Let's get started.
