00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.336
We know angle M and angle T are vertical angles, so they must be equal. T is 32

00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:10.803
degrees. This last part is a little trick. Maybe you saw it. This is a straight

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:15.986
line. So, angles M and A are supplementary, they add to 180 degrees. Notice,

00:00:15.998 --> 00:00:21.514
angle A and T are also supplementary. They both add up to 180 degrees. This also

00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:26.538
is a result of the vertical angles. There's only one possible value for A. We

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.585
know supplementary angles add to 180 degrees. So, if I subtract off 32 degrees,

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:36.221
I get angle A. So, angle A is 148 degrees. Angle H also shares this same

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:41.218
supplementary relationships. So, it's forced to have the same value. Pretty

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.388
interesting, huh?
