00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.230
So the resulting code will be like this. As you can see here,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.602
now I don't have the conditionals any longer, but I just have a call to

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:09.938
this notEligibleForDisability method. And this makes the code so

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:14.092
much clearer, because if I just need to understand how disabilityAmount works,

00:00:14.092 --> 00:00:17.945
I can clearly see there is an initial check that is actually checking whether

00:00:17.945 --> 00:00:22.030
an employee's eligible for disabilities or not. And if the check is false, so

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.180
if the employee's eligible, then I'll just perform the rest of the computation.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.710
Otherwise I'll simply return zero.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.500
So if I don't need to understand the details of this check,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.630
I can simply look at this method and understand it all. And if I need to look at

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.990
the details I can just go, and look at the implementation of this method,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.600
and I will get exactly the same information that I have here. But I'm sort of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.220
separating the concerns, and making the code overall more understandable, and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.160
therefore more maintainable, which is the main goal of refactoring.
