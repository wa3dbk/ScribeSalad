00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.160
So to summarize the advantage of RC over SC, is that, there is no waiting for

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.310
coherence actions on every memory access. So you can overlap computation with

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.420
communication. So the expectation is that you

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.380
will get better performance in a shared

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.300
memory machine if you use the RC memory model, compared to an SC memory model.
