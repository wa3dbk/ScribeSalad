00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.650
So, we've talked a bit about what
our tools needs to be able to do.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.580
What tools are out there for us to use?

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.250
Most people who make prototypes for
a living work with a lot of tools.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.230
And many of them are very well tailored
for a particular kind of prototype.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.268
Some of the tools people use are
Keynote, Powerpoint, Interactive PDFs,

00:00:21.268 --> 00:00:27.690
Balsamiq, Pixate, inVision, and
our good old Pen and Paper.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.790
Don't worry about trying
to remember all of these.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.009
The point is to give you
a sense of what's out there.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.860
In the next video, we'll talk
about what tool we'll be using for

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.990
this lesson and why.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.160
Each of these tools has various
strengths and weaknesses, and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.025
each of them will become a part Part
of a mature prototypers tool kit.

00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:46.595
Let's get a sense of how each tool

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:48.365
matched up with our
requirements right now.

00:00:49.455 --> 00:00:53.475
Keynote is a common tool for when you
want to present a low fidelity prototype

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:55.820
to a group, often within your company.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.330
It's very fast to work with but it's
hard to get remote feedback with and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.450
is non interactive.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.239
PowerPoint is a very similar tool and
it's used for the same reasons.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.700
Again, speed is a strength here, but

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.150
there is no built in feedback and
it's not interactive.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.200
Interactive PDFs made with
Adobe InDesign are a common choice for

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.070
designers who are workshopping
user experiences.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.310
They are interactive and once you've
put in the work to learn the software,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.980
can be made relatively quickly.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.930
However, they have no
remote feedback options.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.790
Balsamiq, with a Q, is one of the faster
prototyping tools, which allows for

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.850
easy iteration but doesn't have
built in remote feedback tools.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.830
Some people combine Balsamiq with
the user testing framework to handle

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.960
that portion.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.370
Pixate is a prototyping software
targeted at high fidelity prototyping.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.740
It does interactions,
and a lot of its power

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.230
is in the way it deals with micro
interactions and animations.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.380
We'll revisit Pixate in the next lesson.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.760
For now, it's a bit slow for
our purposes.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.440
InVision allows you to create
interactive prototypes quickly, and has

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.930
a couple of dedicated tools for getting
remote feedback quickly and effectively.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.130
And finally, our old friend,
the pen and paper, is super fast, but

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.788
doesn't allow remote feedback, and
it doesn't allow interactivity.
