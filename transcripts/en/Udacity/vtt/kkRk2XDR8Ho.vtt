00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.632
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As you saw earlier with mx minus ms equals m times x minus s, we can rewrite

00:00:04.632 --> 00:00:09.791
expressions by looking for what factor different terms in that expression have

00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:14.879
in common. So, let's try this with a few more expressions. Let's start off with

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.591
6x minus 9 equals something, or not just anything, but some factor times an

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:24.334
expression inside parentheses. For this problem and for the several problems

00:00:24.334 --> 00:00:28.302
after this one, I'd like you to restrict the factors that you pull out of the

00:00:28.302 --> 00:00:32.567
original expression to the integers or variables. And make sure that what you

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:36.988
have in the end, in the boxes and parentheses, doesn't have any common factors

00:00:36.988 --> 00:00:41.552
between the terms, aside from 1, of course, since everything is divisible by 1.

00:00:41.552 --> 00:00:45.706
Write the common factor that these two terms have in this box, and that the

00:00:45.706 --> 00:00:49.479
expression that needs to be multiplied by that factor in this box.
