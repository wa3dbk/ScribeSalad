00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.160
So water would satisfy our physiological need. Earning a pay cheque would help

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.678
give us safety and security. Having a happy and secure relationship would

00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:12.885
satisfy the love and belonging level of a hierarchy. Self-confidence would

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:16.481
fulfill the esteem level of the hierarchy and finally having a satisfying

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:21.835
fulfilling career would fulfill the self actualization level of the hierarchy.

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:26.106
So let's take a step back and look at masters hierarchy of needs. It makes

00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:29.868
sense that we would need to have our physical needs met before ever considering

00:00:29.868 --> 00:00:33.573
realizing our full potential, so to recap we need our physiological needs met

00:00:33.573 --> 00:00:39.349
then we can move on to other safety and security needs. And once those two

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:44.090
criteria are met we can move on to our loving and belonging needs. Once we have

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.790
achieved love and belonging then we move up the hierarchy to our esteem needs.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.090
And then finally self-actualization, which is the very top of the pyramid.
