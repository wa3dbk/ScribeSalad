00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.240
What we're showing here is
a picture of high magnification,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.070
probably a electron micrograph,
then pseudo colored, of your retina.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.960
And you can see that retina is
made up of two kinds of receptors

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.650
called rods and cones, and we'll talk
more about the differences between them

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.540
when we do the human
anatomy conversation.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.990
But today,
all we're going to talk about is cones.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.710
And in particular, there are several
million cones in the retina.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.780
They tend to be focused more or grouped
more in the, near the fovea, the middle.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.500
They're responsible for
the high-resolution imagery.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.160
That is your ability to see very

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.805
sort of with a good resolution at
the center of your visual field.

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:41.055
And most importantly, for
today's conversation,

00:00:41.055 --> 00:00:44.125
it's your cones that discriminate color.

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:46.935
That is that they're sensitive
to different wavelengths, and

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:50.625
your, your visual system uses
the outputs of the cones,

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:53.975
processed through a variety
of channels to see color.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:57.425
And particularly there are three
types of cones that are called red,

00:00:57.425 --> 00:00:58.880
green, and blue.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.400
That's not really quite correct,
you'll see why in a minute.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.110
They really should be called long,
medium, and short.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.190
And you'll also see it's written here
that the vast majority of them are red

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.510
and green and a very small
percentage of them are blue.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.320
All right.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.530
So, this is a graph of the sensitivity

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.940
of each of these three types of cones,
roughly red, green and blue, in terms of

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.690
how responsive they are as a function of
a single band of wavelength of light.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.380
So here you see the wavelength of
the light expressed in nanometers, and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.970
you can see that there's
one channel right here that

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.640
starts at the longer range and
peaks somewhere around there.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.330
And then there's another one that's
called green even though it's

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.300
really just offset
a little bit from that.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.450
And then finally,
what's called the blue,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.447
which is really the short
wavelength cone.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.940
If you were to make a picture of sort
of the retinal mosaic and you colored

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.680
the cones, what you'd see would be
a picture that looks kind of like this.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.440
You'll notice that in the middle,
there's hardly any blue cones at all and

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.160
there's some more of them out here,
all right.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.470
But basically almost all of the cones
that are used are in the red and green.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.350
And the the blue is really just
there for a little bit of coverage.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.680
And yet we see color very, very well.
