00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.400
So the best answers for this question are that it does

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.130
depend on the number of keywords. If we have very few keywords,

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.060
well then, our lookup's fast enough. We're probably going to to have more

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.780
keywords than that, so we want our lookup to be faster. The

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.840
third possibility is not actually true. So, it doesn't depend on

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.590
how many URLs there are. And the reason for that is we're

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.330
doing a lookup based on the keywords. The number of times we

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.200
go through the loop and look up depends only on the number

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.260
of elements in index Which is the number of keywords, and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.030
then the size of the URL list for each keyword doesn't impact

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.490
the time it takes to do a lookup. So it doesn't depend

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.870
on the number of URLs. Certainly, if we have more pages, we're

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.790
likely to have more keywords, so that would increase the size of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.200
the index, but just the number of pages itself doesn't affect the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.492
time for lookup. It does depend on how many lookups we want

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:50.850
to do. So if we only want to do one lookup and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.870
that lookup takes a few seconds, well that's okay. It's probably not

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.530
worth spending a lot of time to make that one lookup faster, but

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.120
chances are we're going to want to do lots of lookups. Certainly if we

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.870
wanted to have a real search engine, we'd want to be able to

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.210
serve millions of lookups every day or in the case we will,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.750
many billions of lookups everyday, every hour. So, if we want to do lots

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.290
of lookups, we want lookup to be faster. So, I

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.350
think we have good reasons to want to make our look up faster and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.290
we're also going to learn some interesting computer

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.990
science concepts, by trying to do that.
