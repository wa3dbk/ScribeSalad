00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.625
Since we have parentheses around the negative 3 here and the exponent, the 4 is

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:09.240
written outside of those parentheses. That means that the exponent applies to

00:00:09.252 --> 00:00:14.035
the entire quantity that's inside the parentheses. So, the number that counts as

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:18.620
the base number is negative 3. Negative 3 is the thing that we want to multiply

00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:23.210
by itself 4 times. So, that means we can rewrite this. As negative 3 times

00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:27.995
negative 3 times negative 3 times negative 3. Now you can just evaluate that

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:33.085
numerically. Negative 3 times negative 3 is just positive 9. So you get positive

00:00:33.097 --> 00:00:37.710
9 multiplied by itself which is just equal to 81. So our final answer is 81
