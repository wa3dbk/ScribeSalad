00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.916
Genes provide the instructions and thus, the raw materials to make up your

00:00:04.916 --> 00:00:11.382
cells, tissues and ultimately your whole body. That process of creation, called

00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:16.117
development, is highly variable from person to person and especially in the

00:00:16.117 --> 00:00:21.585
brain. Even small differences in how those cells and tissues are made can be

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:25.810
responsible for differences in personality, intelligence, moods, and even

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.090
vulnerability to mental illness. With that in mind, what do you think is the

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.944
most accurate statement about the connection between genes and behavior? Is it

00:00:36.944 --> 00:00:42.648
that a few genes regulate most behaviors? A single gene controls a single

00:00:42.648 --> 00:00:47.322
behavior. Many genes are behind any given behavior. Or, genes have no

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:51.535
connection with behavior at all? Go ahead and select the statement that you

00:00:51.535 --> 00:00:53.930
think is most likely to be true.
