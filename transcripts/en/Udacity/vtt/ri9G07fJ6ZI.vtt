00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.370
So far we've seen polynomials. The terms haven't been written in any particular

00:00:04.382 --> 00:00:08.630
order. Remember we learned before about the commutative property of addition.

00:00:08.727 --> 00:00:12.955
Changing the order that you add terms together in has no effect on the value of

00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:17.175
the expression; a plus b is just equal to b plus a. So any set of terms that you

00:00:17.187 --> 00:00:21.442
have added together can be written together in any order. And will still be

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:25.925
mathematically correct, regardless of which of those orders you choose to use.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:30.420
However, there is a convention that people use in algebra to help them figure

00:00:30.432 --> 00:00:34.940
out what order to write their terms of a polynomial in. It's pretty simple. The

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:39.473
tendency is to write terms from highest degree to lowest degree. So for example,

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:43.872
if we have this polynomial, y + 6xy. Minus y cubed. We can first figure out the

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:47.926
degree of each term, and then rearrange these terms so that the term with the

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:51.640
highest degree comes first. And then the rest of the terms continue in

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:55.553
descending order of degree. A polynomial written in this way is said to be

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:59.847
written in standard form. So again writing a polynomial in standard form doesn't

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.826
make it any more mathematically correct than writing the terms in any other

00:01:03.838 --> 00:01:07.721
order. But mathematicians usually find the standard form a bit more visually

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:11.444
appealing and it also can help us understand the polynomial as a whole a bit

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:15.325
more quickly than we could if we wrote the terms in a different order. Since in

00:01:15.337 --> 00:01:19.289
standard form the term with the highest degree comes first, we only need to look

00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:23.224
at that first term to figure out what the degree of the entire polynomial is. So

00:01:23.236 --> 00:01:25.829
that's why standard form is particularly convenient.
