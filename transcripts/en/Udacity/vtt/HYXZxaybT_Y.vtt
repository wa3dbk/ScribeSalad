00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.060
Let us revisit the architecture for a cognitive system.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.190
We have come across this several times earlier in this course. We can think in

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.350
terms of three different spaces. A Metacognitive space, a Deliberative space,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.090
and a Reactive space. The Reactive space directly maps percepts from

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.020
the environment into actions in the environment. The Deliberative space

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.330
maps the percepts into actions, with the mappings mediated by reasoning and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.380
learning and memory. So, while this is a see act cycle,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.757
this is a see think act cycle. The metacognitive space

00:00:35.757 --> 00:00:40.630
monitors the deliberative reasoning. It sees the deliberative reasoning and

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.270
acts on the deliberative reasoning. As we had discussed earlier, it's better to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.320
think of these in terms of overlapping spaces rather than disjoint layers.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.510
When we were discussing metacognition we also saw that we could draw arrows back

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.820
from here like this because metacognition could also act on its own.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.990
This cognitive system is situated in the world.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.430
It is getting many different kind of input from the world. Percepts,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.870
signals, goals, communication with other agents. Depending on the input, and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.750
depending upon the resources available to the agent to address that input,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.300
the agent may simply react to the input and give an output in the form of

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.460
an action to a percept, for example. Or the agent may reason about the input.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.310
And then decide on an action after consulting memory and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.610
perhaps invoking learning and reasoning. In some cases,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.630
the input that the agent receives might be as a result of the output it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.720
had given to a prior input. For example, it may have received a goal.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.166
Then come up with a plan. When it had received the input of the plan,

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:48.130
failed upon execution. In that case, deliberation can give an alternative plan.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.140
A metacognition may wonder about, why did the planner fail in the first place?

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.350
And repair the planner, not just the plan. Just like reaction and

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.390
deliberation are situated in the world outside, metacognition, in a way,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.940
is situated in the world inside. It is acting on the mental world.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.620
While deliberation and reaction act on the objects in the external environment.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.263
For metacognition it is the thoughts and the learning and

00:02:12.263 --> 00:02:16.620
the reasoning that are objects internally in the amygdala. Of course,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.850
this input is coming constantly. Even now, as you and I are communicating,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.510
both you and I are receiving input. And we're giving output as well. In fact,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.820
the cognitive system is constantly situated in the world. It is never separate

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.640
from the world. There is no way to separate it. It has input coming constantly.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.460
There is output going out constantly. The world is constantly changing,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.120
and the cognitive system is constantly receiving information about the world.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.595
It uses this knowledge in it's knowledge structure to make sense of

00:02:46.595 --> 00:02:50.920
the data about the world. And it decides on actions to take on the world.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.330
Recall that we had said that intelligence is a function that maps the perceptual

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.270
history into action. And to some degree, intelligence is about actions,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.090
reactions. About selecting your right output to act on the world. Depending on

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.560
the nature of the input the output may vary. If the input is a goal,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.290
the output might be a plan or an action. If the input is a piece of knowledge,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.920
the output might be internal to the cognitive system. And

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.130
the cognitive system may assimilate that knowledge in its internal structures.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.020
If the input is a percept, the output might be an action based on that percept.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.245
If the input is new information, the cognitive system will learn from the new

00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:32.480
information, and then store the result of the learning in its memory. The world

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.545
here consists not just of the physical world, but of the social world as well.

00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:40.260
Thus, this cognitive system is situated not just in the physical world but

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.170
is also situated in the social world, consisting of other cognitive systems and

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.920
constantly interacts with them. Once again, the interactions between these

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.940
cognitive systems can be of many different kinds. Percepts, goals, actions,

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.010
plans, information, data. Any cognitive system is not just monitoring and

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.640
observing the physical world, but it's also monitoring and

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.690
observing the social world, the actions of other cognitive systems in the world,

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.210
for example. Any cognitive system learns not just from its own actions but also

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.140
from the actions of other cognitive systems around it. Thus a cognitive system

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.890
needs to make sense not just to the physical world but also by the social world.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.649
We saw some of this when we were talking about scripts.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.860
There we saw how a cognitive system used a script to make sense of the actions

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.490
of other cognitive systems. This architecture is not merely an architecture for

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.840
building AI agents, it is also an architecture for reflecting on human

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.470
cognition. Does this architecture explain large portions of human behavior?
