One could say a lot about the connection between classification and cognition.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.180
This is because classification is ubiquitous in cognition. You're driving a car

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.640
on the street, you see a friend driving his car, you look, take a look at

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.670
the car, and you see a Porsche. Classification. You're on a computer program,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.240
the output is faulty. You look at the output, decide on the bug.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.440
You name the bug. Classification. You go to a doctor with certain signs and

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.190
symptoms, the doctor names a disease category, classification. The reason

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.660
classification is so ubiquitous is because it allows us to select actions.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.440
Once the doctor knows what the disease category is, he can suggest a therapy.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.260
Once you know what the bug is you can decide on a repair for

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.590
that bug. If action selection indeed is a very productive characterization

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.510
of intelligence then we can see why classification is central to cognition.
