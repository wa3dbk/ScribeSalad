Okay, let's take a quick look at the code.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.500
So this is where you would have passed the ProfileForm

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.400
argument in to save profile. And then the other changed

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.150
you'll have made is that you get the display name

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.400
out from of the profile form. And you also get

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.150
the TeeShirtSize out of the pathed in profile form but

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.610
if the TeeShirtSize is not set by profile form then

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.260
don't get it out of the profile form. Basically just

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.620
use a default that we're already using, this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.440
is where we set the default up here.
