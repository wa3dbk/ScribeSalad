00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:02.675
Four of these operators are both binary and associative--

00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:09.856
multiply, minimum, logical or, bitwise and. Factorial is not binary.

00:00:09.856 --> 00:00:13.424
It only has 1 argument and it needs 2 arguments to be binary.

00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:17.029
And both exponentiation and division are not associative.

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.095
So if you want to prove that to yourself, note that, say,

00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:26.056
(4^3)^2 is not equal to 4(3^2)

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:35.714
or that 8/(4/2) is not equal to (8 /4)/2.
