00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.996
Okay, if you attempted to solve this, you should have gotten these as your

00:00:02.996 --> 00:00:07.307
factored fractions. Now there's a lot of missing work in between. You needed to

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:10.221
change division to multiplication and take the reciprocal of that second

00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:13.920
fraction. I'm not going to show you all the factoring for each of these, but

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.251
hopefully you can figure it out. In the end, we can simplify the factors a plus

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:24.780
7, 3a plus 2, and 2a minus 5. This leaves us with our answer, 4a minus 3

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.860
divided by 3a minus 4. You want to be really careful at the end here, as well.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.147
These last two factors have different coefficients for the a. One is 4, and one

00:00:34.147 --> 00:00:37.960
is 3. You might think that these are opposite polynomials, but we know that's

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.750
not true since the a's have different coefficients, and the constants are

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.761
different as well. We can't simplify these at all, so we'll leave this as our

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:46.983
answer.
