00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.851
So the answer is a bigger sample. If we chose this one also, and let's say these

00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:11.425
two, so we double our sample size. Then you see we have this small value 32%.

00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:17.142
And that's going to drag down the sample statistic X bar, the average. So, this

00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:22.600
will be closer to the population average mu. And of course, ideally, we'd want

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:27.455
the entire population, but often times that's really hard to do, because the

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:32.290
population might be so big. That's when we need a sample. But a bigger sample

00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:37.465
will better approximate the population parameter. Another example where samples

00:00:37.477 --> 00:00:42.424
can be misleading is predicting the outcome of the presidential election. For

00:00:42.436 --> 00:00:46.970
this last Presidential election with President Obama versus Mitt Romney, a lot

00:00:46.982 --> 00:00:51.238
of polls were given out which each came up with its own result. Some of them

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.670
predicted that Romney was going to win, which as we know didn't happen. While

00:00:55.682 --> 00:01:00.209
each sample may not perfectly predict population parameters. The sample

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:05.743
statistic can give us an interval in which the population parameter lies, as

00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:11.165
long as the sample is random and as unbiased as possible. We'll go more into

00:01:11.177 --> 00:01:13.047
depth about samples later.
