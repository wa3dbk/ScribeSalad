00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.510
In this lesson, we have seen that we should be able to get

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.010
excellent performance even when the program has a lot of data dependencies.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.380
In the next several lessons, we will learn how a real processor can actually do

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.850
this only with harder structures that have limited size and complexity.
