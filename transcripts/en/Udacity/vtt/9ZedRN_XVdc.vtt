00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.939
Service Oriented Architecture is, is often of interest at the enterprise level.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.510
That is, big corporations or organizations who have a suite of

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.480
applications that they want to adapt to internet type situations and

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.350
rather than rewriting the whole suite from scratch, they want to re-architect it

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.170
into a service oriented configuration. This can be tricky, as you might imagine.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.610
Any time you're dealing with large amounts of code and rearchitecting them.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.420
You can run into issues of, of reliability. And there's many a story of

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.450
a lot of wasted money leading to systems that don't work as expected. So, in,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.290
in doing such rearchitecting, ultimately you have to take code that maybe was

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.540
used to running on a mainframe in which a code was controlling it's own fate.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.590
It was in charge control-wise for calling the various pieces. Have a service

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.950
oriented type architecture over the internet, and it's intended to be providing

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.420
user functions, then it may have to be switched in to a reactive type system.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.890
That is, responding to the user interactions. This is a major change to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.700
any system to do this. The point I'm making here is that there's a cost in

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.210
doing this and there's a high degree of risk because of that cost.
