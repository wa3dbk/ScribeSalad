00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.339
Now we're going to get into a little bit more regular fractions. We're going to

00:00:03.351 --> 00:00:06.727
tackle another chocolate problem. This is going to be chocolate math 2. So

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:10.091
here's our question. How many batches of brownies can you bake if a recipe

00:00:10.103 --> 00:00:13.997
requires 4/5 cup of sugar, and you have 3 1/2 cups of sugar at home. Write your

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.484
answer as a mixed number, and I'll provide the boxes. Use any math reason that

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:20.947
you know. Remember, the important part is just to try to reason. It doesn't

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:22.838
matter if you're right, right now.

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:26.198
We'll be coming back to this problem later. Just give your best guess now, and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.079
you can always change it and revise it later.
