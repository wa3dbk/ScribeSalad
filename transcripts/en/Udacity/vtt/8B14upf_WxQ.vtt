00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.508
Here's your chance to build a stairway to, well, not heaven, but at least to a

00:00:04.508 --> 00:00:08.733
gold cup, a virtual gold cup. This exercise gets you familiar with how most of 3

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:13.466
JS's, geometric objects work. You'll be spending your time working inside the

00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:17.805
create stairs function. We're going to use the cube geometry method to create 2

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:21.932
pieces for steps, a vertical piece and a horizontal plank. Cube geometry's not a

00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:26.027
perfect name since a cube is defined as having all its dimensions be the same

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:29.826
size. Box geometry would have been better but no big deal. Here's the code for

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:34.448
defining the geometry for two steps. The way cube geometry works is that you

00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:38.266
provide it a size in x, y and z. It then creates a set of triangles for you

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:43.192
forming a box with these dimensions. Once you have this geometric object, you

00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:47.068
can use it as many times as you wish to create 3JS meshes, each of which

00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:51.282
consists of geometry and a material. You can use the position parameter on the

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:54.878
mesh class to re-position the box, and in fact you'll need to do this for the

00:00:54.878 --> 00:00:58.234
exercise. When you create a box, it is centered around the origin. For our

00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:02.894
vertical part of the step, we want this piece to be resting on the ground. To do

00:01:02.894 --> 00:01:07.606
so we take half of the height of the piece and move it this distance upward so

00:01:07.606 --> 00:01:11.951
that the bottom is now at ground level. The horizontal piece making up the flat

00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:15.510
part of this step is created with this code. In this case, we first push the

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.290
step up half its thickness so it rests on the plane, then push it up the rest of

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.510
the height up the vertical piece, so that it rests on top. The z position has

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.937
also changed. Pushing the plank so that one edge is at the origin and that pulls

00:01:27.937 --> 00:01:32.378
back a bit so that it rests firmly on the vertical piece that's shown here. Got

00:01:32.378 --> 00:01:36.435
all that? Once you run the program, you'll see the two step pieces with the

00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:40.738
vertical piece resting on the ground plane. You'll also notice a cool program

00:01:40.738 --> 00:01:45.100
feature. There's some controls available. The grids can help you get a sense of

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.272
distance along each axis. They have lines every 100 units. Each is labeled with

00:01:50.272 --> 00:01:54.759
the axis that are in that grid plane. For example, since the y axis is up for

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.364
this scene, the x, z grid is on the ground plane. Your goal is to build a number

00:01:59.364 --> 00:02:03.270
of steps, one on top of the other going forward that just reaches the gold cup.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.486
Here's what things will look like when you're done. Don't build any more steps

00:02:06.486 --> 00:02:10.198
than are necessary or we'll charge you for extra time and materials, plus you

00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:14.050
won't pass the problem. I recommend that you first play around with the position

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.811
parameter and see its effect on the model. Setting the position to zero shows

00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:21.764
what the block looks like centered at the origin. You should also consider using

00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:25.854
a loop as its a lot easier in the long run than brute force. Being a smart

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:29.668
programmer can save you a lot of groundwork. Using programs to generate geometry

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:33.560
such as a number of stairs is called procedural modeling. Personally, I'm pretty

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.949
bad at using modelers so I like modeling this way. It's great that with a few

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:41.026
lines of code you can generate pretty complex models. Here's a procedural model

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:45.148
called sphere flake that made more than 25 years ago. Around the same time Pixar

00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:49.328
created a short film called Red's Dream. Primarily using procedural modelling,

00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:52.925
since there simply weren't great modelling tools easily available back then. See

00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:56.390
the additional course materials to download the program for this model and

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.855
others, along with pointers to many of the related resources, but don't get

00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:02.613
distracted right now. Go ahead and build the steps.
