00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.800
A matrix such as this one will be extremely helpful

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.208
when we have even more variables than those in the pseudo-Facebook

00:00:07.208 --> 00:00:09.840
data set. Examples arise in many areas, but one that

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.660
has attracted the attention of statisticians is genomic data. In these

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.830
data sets, they're often thousands of genetic measurements for each

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.860
of a small number of samples. In some cases, some of

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.530
these samples have a disease, and so we'd like to identify

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.920
genes that are associated with the disease. In the instructor notes,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.220
you'll find a data set of gene expression in tumors. The

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.980
data contains the expression of 6,830 genes, compared with a larger

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.590
baseline reference sample. Now, this is a ton of data. So

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.060
let's go ahead and read in the data set, and then

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.180
I'll change the color names of the data set to be

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.830
the numbers from one to 64. Now, I'm just doing this

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.740
so that way the plot that I create is going to be

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.270
a little bit nicer with the labeling on the x axis.
