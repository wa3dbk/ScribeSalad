00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.555
To get to the vertex form for the equation for this problem, we need to go

00:00:04.555 --> 00:00:09.637
through the process of completing the square, just like you've done many, many

00:00:09.637 --> 00:00:14.644
times before. The equation in vertex form is y plus 3 equals negative 7 times x

00:00:14.644 --> 00:00:18.997
minus 1 squared, which means that the vertex is at 1 comma negative 3.
