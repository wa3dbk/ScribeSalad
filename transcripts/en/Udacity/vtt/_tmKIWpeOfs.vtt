00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.240
The most important thing to know

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.810
when selling is knowing who you're
selling to and what they care about.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.820
So understanding who is standing in
front of you, whether it's an investor,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.320
an employee, or customer, or partner,
and what they truly care about

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.510
really dictates the tone of what
you're selling and how you sell it.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.640
For that you need to be
able to know everything and

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.080
anything about your business.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.620
So you can tune your pitch to
whoever is standing across from you.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.340
So if in a networking event,
it's an investor and

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.680
you pick it up very quickly you
can have a very specific pitch

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.940
that is different then if across
from you is a potential new hire.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.590
So knowing who that person is is
probably the most important and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.920
first step of developing
your pitching skills and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.220
then obviously the thing that will get
you good at it is just again practicing.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.710
The more you practice the better you'll
be good at it and you can probably

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.690
measure it because your pitches
will become significantly shorter.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.849
It's really easy to sell something
using lots of sentences and

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:11.140
many minutes.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.940
It's really hard to do so
with a few words and a few seconds and

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.410
the more you practice the better
you'll become at selling.
