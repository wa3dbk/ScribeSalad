00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.929
So once you've identified maybe a bunch
of people you want to interview and

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:07.540
maybe offer a job to.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.818
Being compelling to them, why should
they come on board with you beyond

00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:16.180
obviously just getting a paycheck,
can be a challenge in and of itself.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.020
I personally have received many
recruiting emails that say, hey, we're

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.979
a hot new startup doing this thing,
that I really just don't care about.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.233
So being able to infuse or fire up
people's passions about what they care

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:35.865
about is probably the most critical
element in the hiring process.

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:40.296
And having a way to engage the middle
level that would let them commit to you

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:43.960
and your business and
the growth of your business over time.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.216
Doing that means being passionate about
what you say and why you're doing this,

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:53.529
and being honest, and
maybe a little vulnerable, too.

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:55.568
It's an uncomfortable place to be and

00:00:55.568 --> 00:00:59.080
requires a lot of sort of emotional
intelligence on your behalf.
