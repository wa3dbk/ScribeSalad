00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.430
Let's take a look at
the Handshake Protocol.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.370
As we have discussed, the Handshake
Protocol establishes a TLS session.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.910
And it negotiates
the security parameters

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.108
between the client and the server.

00:00:13.108 --> 00:00:18.170
The phase one of the protocol,
establishes the security capabilities,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.100
it is initiated by the client sending
a client hello message to the server.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.170
The client hello message
contains a number of parameters

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.543
including version number,
session ID, crypto suite,

00:00:31.543 --> 00:00:36.160
compression method, and
the initial random numbers.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.430
After sending the client a hello
message, the client waits for

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.250
the server hello message,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.000
which contains the same kind of
parameters as the client hello message.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.210
Therefore, at the interface one,
both the client and

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.360
the server know each other's
security capabilities.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.890
The details of Phase 2 depend on the
underlying public key encryption scheme

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.830
that is being used.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.580
In some cases, the server passes
a certificate to the client, and

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.800
possibly, some additional key
information and the request for

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.030
a certificate from the client.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.490
The final message has
to be server hello done

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.960
which indicates the end of phase two.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.330
In phase three, the server should first
verify the certificate of the server.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.060
For example if the client
is connecting to a server

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.880
say Georgia Tech's website then
the client should be able to verify

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.020
that the certificate contains
the Georgia Tech's public key.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.370
That is, the public key certificate
is Georgia Tech's public key

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.160
signed by the public key of
the certificate authority.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.950
And the client has the private
key of the certificate authority

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.190
to verify the certificate.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.040
Then the client can send key
exchange information to the server.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.390
For example the client can
generate a secret key and encrypt

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.020
the secret key using the server's
public key and send it to the server.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.330
Depending on the application
requirements the client may send

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.600
a certificate To the server in order
to authenticate the client to a server.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.280
Usually, if a website is public facing,
then the authentication is usually

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.440
one way, that is, the client
needs to authenticate the server.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.080
But the server does not require
the client to authenticate his self.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.490
On the other hand, for internal or

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.660
private web servers,
mutual authentication may be required.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.290
In phase two, the client sends
a change cipher spec message and

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.590
copies the pending security parameters
to the current cipher spec.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.190
It then signals the completion
of the handshake protocol.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.850
In response, the server sends
its own change_cipher_spec.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.700
Therefore, they now agree
on the security parameters.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.960
And then the server sends its own
message to signal the end of handshake.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.765
At this point, the handshake
is complete and the client and

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:05.182
server can begin to exchange
application layer data protected using

00:03:05.182 --> 00:03:07.710
the agreed upon security parameters.
