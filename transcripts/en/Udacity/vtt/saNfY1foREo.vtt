00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.540
So, we'll need to identify our region.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.210
Again, I'm using these regions of
circles, which is scale invariant.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.800
A property that this region would
have to have is that it should not be

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.380
affected by the size and will be
the same for all corresponding regions.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.630
To build on this, let's actually kind
of think about a simple example.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.620
This simple example basically says that
average intensities are interesting

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.480
things to observe.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.520
For any corresponding regions,
even if the object is of different size,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.720
the average intensity, the image
pixel intensity in that region,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.910
will be the same.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.363
So while we zoom in and out, we need to
start looking at the fact that if I do

00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:44.035
have a region in both of those parts,
the average intensity of that region,

00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:46.899
if it's the same object,
should be the same.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.700
Because as I said, it's the same object,
just viewed at different scales.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.260
We resolve this,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.540
by again computing the intensities
at different scales at a point.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.040
Compute the scale invariant
function at different sizes and for

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.380
different neighborhoods.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.890
And then choose a scale for each image
at which the function is maximum.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.250
Let's see what that can be.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.230
So again, this is the function
that I'm looking at.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.800
This is my intensity.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.920
And I'm going to scale
up the region size and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.050
see where I actually
find a certain peak.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.810
Of course this could be done for
Image 1 this way.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.250
And of course now I have an image
that's half the size of the object and

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.220
an image that's half the size.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.175
Again, if I was to take the region size
and measure the function that changes,

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:32.695
it'll actually have the same peak, but

00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:36.880
it'll actually be doing it much faster
just because the image is at half scale.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.420
So just basically now start seeing is
that the peak and stuff like that for

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.510
this function are the same, just how
it impacts with the region size.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.530
So we need to start thinking about
where we can find functions like this.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.200
Of course, this kind of starts telling
us that we can find, again the scale

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.280
here is important and the scale for this
one would be, these are the two scales.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.700
If I know that, I should be able to
now compute where in which region,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.710
which size of the circle do I
want to use to look at an image for

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.711
detection of features.
