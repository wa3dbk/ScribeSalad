00:00:00.135 --> 00:00:03.820
JSON maps almost perfectly onto Python dictionaries and arrays.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.980
Parsing XML is a lot more complex, so there are

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.290
several options to choose from. We'll look at some of

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.900
the most common. I also recommend that you have a

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.190
look at the Python XML page to see what your

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.500
options are. Let's first look at parsing XML into a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.430
document tree. The fundamental difference between this and event driven

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.940
or, what we might call sax parsing of XML is

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.600
that, here, we're going to read the entire XML tree

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.530
into memory. We're going to use the XML e tree

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.250
Element tree module, which is part of the Python standard

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.640
library. With element tree we can parse data in a couple

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.240
of different ways. We can parse it by file name.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.790
We can also use it from a string method of

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.250
the element tree module to parse XML stored as a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.080
string value in our program. As we think about parsing XML,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.670
using element trees. It makes most sense to work

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.500
with documented oriented XML data. So let's return to the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.280
research article example. This data set from Bio med

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.920
central is both an excellent example of XML used to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.940
encode documents and one type of data that data

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.010
scientist, specifically text minded folks, are likely to use in

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.710
their work. In extracting the data we need from

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.570
a tree, we're mostly going to be working with element objects.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.150
Elements permit us to iterate over their children.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.830
For example here, we've parsed our research article into

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.220
a tree and then from this tree, we're getting

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.060
the root element. Then we're going to iterate over

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.340
the children of that root element, and in

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.830
this case use the tag attribute to print out

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.640
the tag name. Of each child element. So let's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.940
see what this looks like when we run it.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.420
Okay, now let's take a look at that xml document

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.970
again to see where these values come from. Okay, and

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.860
here we can see that this is the root element,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.020
and we are getting out all of the elements that are

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.110
nested immediately within that element or the direct children of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.360
that element, ui, ji, and fm. And we can see

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.860
that those are coming out here. Now, if we want

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.330
to extract the title of an article we can see that

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.160
its found in the bibliography section of the front

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.610
matter section. Let's see how me might extract that. Element

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.190
tree supports basic x path expressions. Because, in data

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.210
wrangling we're often pulling most of the data out of

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.190
an XML document, this level of support is going

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.900
to be sufficient for many if not most of our

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.980
needs. Returning to the problem of extracting the title, we

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.520
can do that as follows. So, here, you can see

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.980
that I'm using the find method on the root

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.160
element. And I'm using an x path expression to

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.950
specify where I expect to find a title element.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.870
That simply means, start at the current element. And

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.920
then work your way down into the fm element

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.580
and it's child the bibl or bibliography element and

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.070
then finally into the title element itself. Note that

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.630
this is very much like the way that you specify

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.280
a path in a URL or in many file systems.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.190
Now it turns out that in this data, many of

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.260
the text elements are actually wrapped in paragraph tags. And

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.710
we can see that that's the case actually for the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.230
title here. So what I'm going to do here is with

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.180
the title element that I got by using this xpath

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.890
expression in this find method, I'm simply going to iterate

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.930
over all of the children of title. Very similar syntax

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.160
to what we saw before when iterating over all of the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.400
children of root. And for each child, I'm simply going to take

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.630
the text of that child and concatenate it on to my

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.870
title text. Now, so far for elements we've seen two different attributes.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.290
The first one was tag and now we're seeing the text

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.310
attribute. There are a number of attributes for elements that are useful.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.340
These are two of the most common that you'll end up using.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.030
Okay, and then here we're simply going to print out the title.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.900
So, let's go ahead and run this and then we'll

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.580
return and take a look at what this piece of code

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.770
is doing for us. Okay, and here we can see that

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.860
the title is actually selected and printed out properly. Here we're

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.780
actually printing out the author email addresses. Let's take a look

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.110
at how we did that in the code. Here we're going

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.370
to use the find all method. Instead of the Find method.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.250
Find All with return all of the elements that match this

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.350
x path expression. And so, we're simply going to iterate over

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.870
each one of those elements and then for each one of

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.100
those elements, we're going to do a Find in order to

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.140
locate the email tag. So, let's go again then and take

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.160
a look at the data. Okay, so my x path expression

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.260
gets me this far, down here into the author group. And

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.790
then for each one of these authors, I'm doing a find

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.310
for an email element, and I'm selecting the text of that

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.440
element, here, and simply printing it out.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.260
So again, this selects all of the individual

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.190
authors found in the author group that's part

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.351
of the bibliography section in the front matter.
