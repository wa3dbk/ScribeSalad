00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.040
Now you've heard the term thread. Well, it's

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.770
also used in the context of an operating

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.430
system. What is the difference between a process

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.110
and a thread? An analogy will help here. Let's

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.170
say here is the morning newspaper. This morning

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.550
newspaper lying on the dining table is like a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.630
program in memory. No life. I come to

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.730
the dining table, pick up the newspaper, and particularly

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.780
the sports section of the newspaper and start

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.470
reading it. My starting to ready the sports section

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.160
of the newspaper is akin to the operating system,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.650
giving life to the program by starting to execute

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:45.150
it. So, now there is one life in the program. That is one line of control, that

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.730
is coursing through the core and data structures of

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.290
the program. This is what is called the thread

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.470
of execution through the program. So we

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.820
have one thread of control that is coursing

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.510
through the program just as I am reading.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.610
A section of the newspaper. Now, my wife

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.700
comes along, and being the more responsible one

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.930
in the family picks up the business section

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.120
and starts reading it. That's perfectly fine, depending

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.770
on our interests, I'm reading the sports section.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.440
While wife is reading the business section, each is reading a different section

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.680
of the same newspaper. similarly, we can

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.110
have multiple lives, coursing through the program.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.940
Each blazing a completely different trail through the code and data structures

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.790
of the program. Now each of this is a thread of control. Now could there

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.050
be a conflict between these different threads

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.720
of control? Sure. Both my wife and I

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.210
may want to read the same section

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.050
of the newspaper. That's a conflict. Similarly. The

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.060
threads that are executig whitin the same

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.270
program may wana read or update the same

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.980
data structres. These are the issues that

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.720
the operating system has to deal with, and

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.330
this is what I meant when I said that te operating system is the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.190
orbiter for copleteing reqests for rescorces. Now

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.190
generalizing it. A program can have several threads

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.910
of control, and each thread of control

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.050
maybe coursing through different sections of the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.850
program. And it could also be competing for the same section of the program as

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.850
well as the same data structure in order to manipulate. Thus, a process. Is a

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.030
program plus the state of all the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.670
threads that are executing within the program. Just

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.080
as a single newspaper could be shared by me, my wife, and possibly my children.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.120
In a similar manner, a program may

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.900
have multiple lives. That are coursing through it.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.700
And each is a bit of control, and the process is the program

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.470
in execution, meaning it is the program plus the state of all the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.600
threads that are currently executing within this program. For example, if

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.240
this program. Is a web browser. One thread in this

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.200
program, could be fetching a page that I've requested from the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.880
remote server. And another thread could be painting the screen for me.
