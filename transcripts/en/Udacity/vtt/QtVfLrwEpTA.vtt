The final thing I'd like to ask you to do in this homework is

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
create a URL that flushes your cache and that should behave something like this.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay! So I'm looking at the blog and if you scroll down to the bottom,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you can see there's some age of the query.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And if I already go to /flush

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and we can see when we reload this front page, it is 0 seconds old.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now I made my /flush delete the cache and then redirect to the blog page

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I think that's probably the simplest way to do it,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
although we won't be checking the redirect itself.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We'll just run it and then reload your pages and see what the query time is.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And If I've to go to any of these permanent links that I just clicked on,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we can see that they all reset to 0 seconds ago as well.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So, when you've got that working, submit the URL to the flush URL here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And thanks and good luck!
