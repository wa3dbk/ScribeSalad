00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.172
For this inequality, the interval would be negative infinity to negative 3,

00:00:04.172 --> 00:00:09.480
union 2 to positive infinity. Great solving if you found those two regions.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.720
When we find the solution set for a quadratic inequality, we first want to

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.732
start by finding the zeros. These are the x values that make the equation equal

00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:22.865
to 0. We factor this quadratic using x plus 3 times x minus 2 as the factors,

00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:26.765
then we set each factor to equal to 0 to get x equals negative 3 and x equals

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:32.956
positive 2. We use these x values to set up our three intervals, so we know the

00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:36.924
values of x might be less than negative 3, between negative 3 and 2, or greater

00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:43.330
than 2. These different regions are the possible solutions to our inequality.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.870
We test the value in the first interval to see if it makes the inequality true.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.714
I'm going to choose the value x equals negative 4. Plugging in negative 4 for

00:00:51.714 --> 00:00:56.548
x, we'll get 6 is greater than 0, which we know is a true statement. This

00:00:56.548 --> 00:01:01.558
means, any value less than negative 3 will make this inequality true. And

00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:06.256
notice, we've already got our first interval. Negative infinity to negative 3,

00:01:06.256 --> 00:01:10.785
here. We need to test the value now for interval II. I'll use x equals 0, since

00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:15.206
that's pretty easy to plug in and evaluate. If x is equal to 0, then these two

00:01:15.206 --> 00:01:20.386
terms would drop out. They would just be 0. And we'd be left with negative 6 is

00:01:20.386 --> 00:01:25.654
greater than 0. We know this statement is not true. So this region is false. We

00:01:25.654 --> 00:01:29.490
exclude it from our solution set. And finally, we try a different value of x

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.960
for our third interval. I'll use x equals 3. When we plug in x equals 3, here

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.542
and here, we'll get the statement 6 is greater than 0. This is true. This means

00:01:40.542 --> 00:01:46.057
any value greater than 2 will satisfy our original inequality. And notice we

00:01:46.057 --> 00:01:50.470
have our second region. From 2 all the way up to positive infinity.
