00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.440
This lesson will focus on one of
the quintessential problems of

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.970
linear algebra.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.210
Given a set of flat geometric
objects such as lines and

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.920
planes, what are their
common intersection points?

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.870
In the abstract it isn't immediately
obvious why this problem has much

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.440
interest outside of pure mathematics.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.440
How do the intersections of lines and
planes come up in real life?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.620
Geometric objects are often defined to
be sets of points whose coordinates

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.550
satisfy a particular relationship,
like an equation.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.420
For example, this ellipse in the plane
is the set of all points x,y

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.110
that satisfy the equation 1/4 times x
squared plus 1/9 times y squared = 1.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.295
In this shape in 3 dimensions called a
hyperboloid is the set of all points X,

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:55.930
Y, Z satisfying the equation x
squared + y squared- z squared = 1.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.920
Flat objects like lines and planes
satisfy a special type of equation

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.920
called the linear equation In which the
only operations allowed are adding and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.700
subtracting variables and constants and
multiplying variables by constants.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.750
So for example, x + 2y = 1 and

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.220
y/2- 2z = x are linear equations.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.210
But x squared- 1 = y is not
linear because x is being

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.320
multiplied by x and
y over x = 3 is also not

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.560
linear because a variable y is being
divided by another variable x.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.290
In real world situations these equations
typically come from observed or

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.130
modeled relationships
between quantities.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.770
Let's take a look at a modified example
from machine learning for trading.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.890
Suppose I'm trading stocks and
I have a choice of two stocks, A and

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.820
B, that I can put into my portfolio.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.420
Let's denote the proportion of each
in my portfolio by w A and w B.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.300
Which are weights between 0, meaning
none of that stock is in the portfolio,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.590
and 1, meaning that the portfolio
is entirely that stock.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.120
Note that wA and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.380
wB have to add up to 1 since any portion
of the portfolio that isn't A must be B.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.070
This gives me the linear
relationship wA + wB = 1.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.210
Each stock also has an associated metric
called its beta value representing

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.750
how correlated its price movements are
with those of the overall stock market.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.840
The beta value of my portfolio is
a weighted average of the beta values of

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.960
its individual components.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.380
So if the beta value of A is -1, and

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.550
the beta value of B is 2,
then the beta value of my portfolio

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.238
is wA(-1) + wB(2),

00:02:55.238 --> 00:02:59.210
or simplified, 2wB- wA.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.510
Having a beta value of 0
means that the portfolio

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.700
is uncorrelated with the market.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.960
So it has minimal market risk.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.150
Suppose I want to choose my weights so
that I minimize market risks.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:19.330
Then that means I need the weights to
satisfy the equation to wB- wA = 0.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.090
This gives me a second to
linear relationship between

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.940
the weights of the stocks
in my portfolio.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.440
In other words, I now have two lines.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.670
Finding what values of wA and
wB satisfy both equations.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.050
In other words finding at what
point the two lines intersect at

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.230
tells me what the weights of
the stocks I choose should be

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.680
in order to minimize my
portfolios market risk.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.570
Often variables are factors
that are within our control but

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.220
which we want to set to correct values
in order to satisfy some constraints.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.980
In the previous example our variables
were the weights of the stocks in

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.360
the portfolio.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.970
And we had two constraints that
we wanted the weights to satisfy

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.090
in order to achieve some goal.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.820
Interpreting this problem in geometric
language, we created two lines and

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.660
we want to find the point
where they intersected.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.570
What we created is called
a system of linear equations.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.140
Finding points that satisfy all
the equations at the same time is called

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.790
solving the system.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.780
In practice this is how problems
involving the intersections of geometric

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.160
objects come about.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.890
These types of problems show up in
fields as diverse as economics, biology,

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.350
chemistry, physics, engineering,
and of course computer science.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.490
In this lesson we will use our tools
from the first lesson on vector

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.830
operations to solve this ubiquitous
problem of finding intersections.
