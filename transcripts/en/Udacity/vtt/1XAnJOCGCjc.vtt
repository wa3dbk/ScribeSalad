Here are some shaded images. Notice that some of the parts are shaded and some

00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:09.443
are not. What I want you to do is count the number of parts that are shaded, and

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:14.245
count the number of parts in total, in the whole. You can enter your answers in

00:00:14.257 --> 00:00:18.818
these boxes. So for example, for the first one, I know that I have 1, 2, 3 parts

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.790
that are shaded out of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 parts total in the whole.
