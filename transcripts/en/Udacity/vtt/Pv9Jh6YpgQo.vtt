00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.490
In this class we have talked a lot about how AI agents must be able to

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.750
reason about the work. But the external work consists of systems from many

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.570
different kinds. A system is composed of heterogeneous interacting components.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.460
The interaction within components, lead to processes of different kinds.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.119
These processes can occur at many different of those abstraction.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.070
Some of the processes might be invisible. Consider an ecosystem.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.380
In an ecosystem, processes occur at many levels of abstraction. Physical,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.200
biological, chemical. Some of these processes are invisible to the naked eye,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.800
but they influence each other. Similarly in business, businesses are composed of

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.440
a large number of interacting units, manufacturing, marketing, delivery, and so

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.410
on. Each of these units can be described at many levels of abstraction, from

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.540
individuals, to teams, to full organizations. Given that the extra work consists

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.730
of systems of different kinds. Their agents must be capable of systems thinking.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.700
They must be capable of thinking about the invisible properties of systems.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.050
About the complex behavior of the systems. In particular,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.080
they must be able to derive the invisible processes from the visible structure.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.520
This is systems thinking.
