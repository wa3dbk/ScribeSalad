00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.300
In the last lesson we've trained
a simple logistic classifier on images.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.520
Now, we're going to take this classifier
and turn it into a deep network.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.660
And it's going to be
just a few lines of code,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.450
so make sure you understand well what
was going on in the previous model.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.290
In the second part you are going to take
a small peak into how our optimizer does

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.688
all the hard work for you computing
gradients for arbitrary functions.

00:00:25.688 --> 00:00:28.951
And then we are going to look
together at the important topic of

00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.991
regularization, which will enable us
to train much, much larger models.
