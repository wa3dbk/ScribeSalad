00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.100
Here is the project you're going
to help complete and get working.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.970
It's a little quiz app that reads
a phrase to you in a random language and

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.740
displays three choices.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.540
One of these is the correct one.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.960
You can make a choice or
hear another phrase.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.160
The app you know if what you
choose is correct or not.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.730
We built this app with two purposes.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.920
First, we think can be a fun little
app to show your family and friends.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.430
Here and your hands after
a few minutes on the Udacity

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.830
iOS developer nanodegree you have an app
that can speak in multiple languages.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.200
The second purpose is in my
mind the most important one.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.130
With this app you can get
a glimpse of the power of iOS.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.030
We did not use pre recorded audio iOS is
speaking in these different languages

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.450
on the fly.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.610
Let me stress that point again iOS is
able to speak any text that you have

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.280
in a variety of languages with
just a few lines of code.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.010
Okay let's get you
started in the structure

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.000
notes you will find to start a project.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.500
Wrap this project and open it in
Xcode I'll guide you from there.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.540
We will cover Xcode in depth
in the next lesson, but

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.420
if you want an overview now, feel
free to go through our Xcode tutorial

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.110
