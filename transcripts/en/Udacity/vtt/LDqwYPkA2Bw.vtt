00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.152
I think it's time that we introduce a pretty important word, the root of a

00:00:04.152 --> 00:00:08.316
polynomial. This is a word we're going to hear more and more in the coming

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:12.834
lessons. So I think we should get used to it now. So if the root of a polynomial

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:16.684
is a number n, such that when you substitute n in the spot of x in that

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:21.276
polynomial, it makes the polynomial equal to 0. Then what do you think the root

00:00:21.276 --> 00:00:26.000
is? Where do we get that number that is the root from? Is the root just 0? Is it

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.529
the x coordinate of the vertex of the parabola? Is it the y coordinate of the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.989
vertex? Is it the x coordinate of the y intercept? The y coordinate of the y

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.493
intercept? The x coordinate of the x intercept? Or the y coordinate of the x

00:00:39.493 --> 00:00:40.234
intercept?
