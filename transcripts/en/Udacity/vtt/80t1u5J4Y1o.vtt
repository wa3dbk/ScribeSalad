The basic HTML for grabbing the canvas object is pretty straightforward. We've

00:00:03.408 --> 00:00:07.711
seen this before. The interesting thing that we haven't yet covered is grabbing

00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:12.572
the context of the canvas. Think of the canvas object that we fetched from the

00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:17.645
DOM as a DOM element. While the context is a handle to the drawing APIs that

00:00:17.657 --> 00:00:22.182
we'll be able to use to modify the canvas visuals later. In this simple example,

00:00:22.187 --> 00:00:26.115
we set the width and height to 1200 by 720 respectively. Now, it's worth

00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:30.355
pointing out, that any time the user would resize the screen, the canvas will

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:33.885
remain this size. For the purposes of GRITS, we actually use the

00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:38.800
window.innerwidth and window innerheight. sizes for our canvas, allowing it to

00:00:38.812 --> 00:00:40.715
occupy the fullscreen for the user.
