00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.040
For this quiz, the goal is to see that you

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.470
understand how to define a dictionary. You should define a dictionary

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.820
and assign it to the variable population, and it should

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.370
provide information on the world's largest cities. The key values in

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.170
your dictionary should be names, the name of each city.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.520
And the associated value is the city's population in millions. So

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.800
that's a number. To get you started, here are the four

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.420
cities that your dictionary should

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.500
include. Shanghai's population of 17.8 million,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.197
Istanbul with 13.3 million, Karachi, 13.0, and Mumbai with

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.549
12.5. If you don't happen to live in one

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.740
of those four cities, you might want to also include

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.270
your hometown and any other cities that you're interested

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.120
in. If you define your dictionary correctly, you should

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.360
be able to use it like this. Print the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.710
population, indexing, looking up the value associated with the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.951
key Mumbai, and you should get as output 12.5.
