00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.020
What does it mean to evaluate
opportunity cost and

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.080
how can you use it to make better
decisions for your business?

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.850
As an entrepreneur,
you're going to face a ton of decisions,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.250
and you'll have to adapt to
new situations as they unfold.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.230
What if new opportunities come up.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.630
What if things take
longer than expected or

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.180
maybe things actually go
quicker than you thought.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.430
When this happens, you'll need to
change gears and adjust your direction.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.480
But how do you know which way to go?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.640
One way to figure this out is to
evaluate the opportunity cost of your

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.880
decisions.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.530
So what's opportunity cost?

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.440
Opportunity cost is the loss of
potential gain from other alternatives

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.845
when one alternative is chosen.

00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:42.025
In other words, every decision you make
has a potential gain associated with it.

00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:43.925
And any time you choose one option,

00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:47.045
you're missing out on the potential
gains of a different option.

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.095
It's up to you to compare
each decision and

00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:51.875
determine which one has
the most potential gain.

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:54.793
This will minimize the opportunity
cost of the direction you take.

00:00:54.793 --> 00:00:56.589
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.987
Here's a few questions you can ask
yourself to help evaluate your

00:00:58.987 --> 00:00:59.980
opportunity cost.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.470
Is there something I
could be doing right now

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.800
that would be a better use of my time?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.590
Is there any way I could be managing
my resources better and how could I put

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.510
myself on my team in a position to
make the best use of their skills?

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.360
Any time that you're not doing these
things as effectively as you could be

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.720
your actions have some opportunity
cost associated with them.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.700
There are more specific values you
can start to place on these numbers.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.860
But getting this basic mindset
is a great place to start.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.030
Moving forward, try to think,
what else could I be doing right now?

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.950
Is there a way my time, money, or
resources could be better spent?

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.470
&gt;From there, you can start weighing
the opportunity cost of each

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.180
decision you make.
