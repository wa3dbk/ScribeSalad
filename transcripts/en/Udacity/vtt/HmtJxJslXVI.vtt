00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.280
We're now moving on to cover interdomain

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.610
routing or routing between ASes. Recall that internet

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.430
routing consists of routing between tens of

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.850
thousands of independently operated networks, or autonomous systems.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.309
Each of these networks operate in their

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.050
own self-interest, and have independent economic and performance

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.940
objectives, and yet they must cooperate to provide

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.110
global connectivity so that when you're sitting at

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.570
home, you can retrieve content that might

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.890
be hosted at the Georgia Tech network. Now,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.920
each independently operated network is called an autonomous

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.290
system, or AS. And each AS advertises reachability

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.710
to some destination by sending what are

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.920
called route advertisements or announcements. The protocol that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.740
ASes use to exchange these route advertisements is

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.160
called the Border Gateway Protocol, or simply, BGP.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.390
A route advertisement has many important attributes, but

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.400
for now, let's just talk about three. Now a

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.020
router here, let's say on the Comcast network, might

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.280
receive a route advertisement, typically from its neighboring AS.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.830
That route advertisement might contain a destination prefix,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.410
such as the IP prefix for Georgia Tech. Then

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.820
it might contain what's called a next hop IP

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.790
address, which is the IP address of the router

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.380
that Comcast router must send traffic to, to send

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.140
traffic along that route. Typically that next hop IP address

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.620
is the IP address for the first router in

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.400
the neighboring network. And Comcast router knows how to reach

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.580
that next hop IP address because its border router

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.320
and the border router in the neighboring AS are on

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.570
the same subnet. Typically this might be a /30

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.650
subnet, therefore this IP address is reachable from Comcast's border.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.390
A third important attribute is whats called the

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.019
AS path which is a sequence of what are

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:49.310
called AS numbers, that describe the route to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.768
the destination. Now strictly speaking, the AS path is

00:01:52.768 --> 00:01:57.745
nothing more than the sequence of ASes that the route traversed to reach the

00:01:57.745 --> 00:02:02.660
recipient AS. So for example, Georgia Tech's AS number is

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.096
2637 and Abilene's is 10578. So the AS path that Comcast

00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:11.576
would hear if it received a route advertisement

00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:15.404
from Abilene for Georgia Tech, would be 10578

00:02:15.404 --> 00:02:18.249
followed by 2637. So in the remainder of

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.289
the lesson we'll look at other BGP route

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.449
attributes. But these are essentially the three most

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.786
important because they describe how to stitch together

00:02:26.786 --> 00:02:30.020
an interdomain path to a global destination. So

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.500
we have the destination IP prefix for the destination

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.720
that a router might want to send traffic to. The

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.080
next hop, which is the IP address for the router

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.890
for the next hop along the path. And finally,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.860
the AS path, which is the sequence of ASes that

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.260
the route traversed en route to the AS that's

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.830
hearing the announcement. The last AS number on the AS

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.370
path is often called the origin AS, because that is

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.950
the AS that originated the advertisement for this IP prefix.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.020
In this case, the origin AS is 2637, or Georgia Tech,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.160
because it is the AS that originated the announcement for this prefix.
