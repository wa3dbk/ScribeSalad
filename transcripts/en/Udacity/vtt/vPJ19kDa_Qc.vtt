00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.620
Wow, that was complicated.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.170
You think that blowing
robots to smithereens

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.560
would be the easiest thing in the world,
right?

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.620
Awesome work keeping track
of GigaGal's bullets and

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.430
myriad explosions and with that the core
mechanics of GigaGal are complete.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.110
In the next two levels we'll
add in the capabilities to

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.170
load up a level from an external file.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.160
And then we'll add a ton of polish
to the game rules, add a HUD, and

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.310
mobile controls.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.810
Keep it up.
