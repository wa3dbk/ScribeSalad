00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.972
So, we know the slope of our new line must be negative 3 halves and we have a

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:08.211
point, so that means we can use point slope form to find the equation. Now that

00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:12.241
we know the slope and the point, we can use our point slope form to figure out

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:16.430
the equation of the line. So I want you to figure this out. What's the equation

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.260
of our line in standard from? Write your answer here.
