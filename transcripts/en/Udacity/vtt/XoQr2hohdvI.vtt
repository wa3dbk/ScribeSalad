00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.769
You've seen how important it is to visualize data sets with histograms, in order

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:08.930
to analyze the shape. We want to analyze the shape so that we can think

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.731
critically about the mean, median and mode to describe the data set. In a skewed

00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:18.517
distribution, the mean, median and mode differ from each other. And the median

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:22.967
might be more useful than the mean in a lot of ways. In a normal distribution

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:27.575
The mean, median, and mode are approximately equal. What else is important about

00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:31.975
knowing the shape of a distribution? Let's explore this question with a story.

00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:35.880
I've played chess my whole life. I learned when I was four, and started

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.410
competing in tournaments when I was seven. There are three things I could tell

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.747
you about my chess abilities. The first is my rating in chess, which all

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:49.516
competitive players have, my ratings 1800. Another thing I could tell you, is

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:54.407
that among competitive American chess players, I come in 8,110th place, this is

00:00:54.407 --> 00:00:58.678
base on rating. And the third, is that I rank higher than 88% of American

00:00:58.678 --> 00:01:03.450
competitive chess players. Which one of these gives you the best sense, of how

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.034
good I am at chess? For most of you, you won't know what a rating is, but if you

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:12.743
do, pretend like you don't and you're hearing this term for the first time. So

00:01:12.743 --> 00:01:17.488
for the purposes of the quiz, if you knew nothing about chess, What would be the

00:01:17.488 --> 00:01:19.736
best metric to tell you how good I am?
