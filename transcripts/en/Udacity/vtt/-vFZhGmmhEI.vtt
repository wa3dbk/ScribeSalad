00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.360
Let's look at the solution
to our virtual memory quiz.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.010
We said that the computer
has 16 active applications,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.490
each with a 32-bit address space.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.690
So each potentially sees
a four gigabyte memory.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.720
What is the real memory in the system?

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.210
It turns out that all of these
are potentially correct.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.710
We can have a system that has only
two 2-gigabyte memory modules.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.570
So it really has a total of
4 gigabytes physical memory.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.000
Yet it can run 16 applications,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.540
each of which thinks that it
has 4 gigabytes of memory.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.570
We can also have more memory,
even more memory,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.360
a different combination of memory and
so on.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.980
So pretty much what the applications
think they have in terms of memory and

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.310
what the system really has can be
completely decoupled by virtual memory.
