00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.480
The cell radio in your device
operates roughly like this.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;From an initial idle state,
it takes a couple of seconds

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.500
to turn on, until it 
can start transmitting.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.650
That kind of latency makes
for a sucky web browsing experience.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.850
So rather than going back to idle,
state machine stays on at full power

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.120
for a certain amount of time,
typically around five to ten seconds,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.010
before dropping to an
intermediate low power mode

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.120
that uses less battery than full power,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.666
and has lower latency
to return to full power

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.102
than the standby mode.

00:00:28.102 --> 00:00:30.960
If a new transfer is initiated, 
the radio will be promoted

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.716
back to full power mode.

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:34.862
And if nothing happens
for another period of time,

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:37.590
typically around
30 seconds to a minute,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.080
it'll drop back to standby.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.730
The exact latency in tail times
varies between carriers,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.486
and even within carriers
between states and countries,

00:00:45.486 --> 00:00:48.472
as they try to balance low latency 
with longer battery life

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:50.540
based on factors like cell congestion,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.820
and typical or prevailing
network conditions.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.596
So if the exact timings vary,

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.852
how do we optimize
our transfer frequency?

00:00:56.852 --> 00:01:00.260
Ultimately, it doesn't matter
what the specific timings are.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.296
You just need to understand
that the network

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:06.882
is going to attempt to balance
low latency with high battery life.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.780
For us, when it comes to
planning out data transfers,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.030
we'd really like to be
somewhere around here.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.590
Now if we return briefly
to the cell radio state machine,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.340
we know that every time
we perform a data transfer,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.440
the radio will stay active for at least
another five seconds of full tail time,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.260
and anywhere from 30 seconds
to a minute at low power

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.630
before it finally returns to standby.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.760
That means every time
you initiate a transfer,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.120
you're powering the cell radio up
for at least 20 seconds.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.043
So let's take a look at how
that affects an app,

00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:38.006
using the little cookie approach.

00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:39.864
An app like this 
can drain the battery

00:01:39.864 --> 00:01:42.332
without even having
to transfer much data.

00:01:42.332 --> 00:01:45.961
Each of these small peaks
is an app pinging its analytics

00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:47.170
back to the server.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.200
In this case, every 15 seconds.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.903
These larger peaks represent 
intermittent data transfers

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.696
based on user interaction.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.040
For example, they may be viewing
a restaurant listing

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.970
or looking at tomorrow's 
weather forecast.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.780
Beneath it, we've graphed 
how this affects the radio state.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.703
The blue shows active data transfers.

00:02:04.703 --> 00:02:07.506
The red, the radio in full power.

00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:10.410
And yellow, showing low power mode.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.640
The gaps in between, if there were any,
indicate when the radio was idle.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.240
So while this app is running,
what is the percentage of time

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.180
that the cell radio is able
to go back to its idle state?
