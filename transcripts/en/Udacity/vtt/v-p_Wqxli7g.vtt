00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.411
We've already seen that we can solve the equation x squared equals negative 1.

00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:08.720
Using our new kind of numbers, imaginary numbers. And we got x equals plus or

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.849
minus i as the solution to this equation. We should be able to then, solve

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.515
equations like this. X squared equals negative 9. Please write your solutions in

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:20.041
this box and simplify them as much as you can.
