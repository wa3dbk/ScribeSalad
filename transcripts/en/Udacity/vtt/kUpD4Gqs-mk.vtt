This function is even. Let's check this out using the numbers 1 and negative 1

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.925
for values of x. When we plug in either 1 or a negative 1 into f of x, we get

00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:15.758
negative 7 over 5 in both cases. Now, ideally, we check this with more than one

00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:20.160
set of numbers. And if you don't trust me, you can totally go back and do that.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.040
But I declare this function, even.
