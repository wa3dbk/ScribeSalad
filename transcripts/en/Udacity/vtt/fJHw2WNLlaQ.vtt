00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.680
The most commonly used symmetric
encryption algorithms are the so

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.980
called block ciphers.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.660
A block cipher takes as input
a plaintext in fixed sized blocks, and

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.140
it produces a block of ciphertext of
equal size, for each plain text block.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.130
To process a longer plain text, we can
first break the plain text into a series

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.990
of fixed size blocks, and then,
apply block ciphers to each block.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.330
The most important symmetric algorithms,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.310
all of which are block ciphers, are the
data encryption standard, or DES, and

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.840
the advanced encryption standard or AES.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.740
We will present more technical details
of these algorithms in a later lecture.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.160
For now, we note that these two
different algorithms have different

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.690
block sizes and key length.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.070
We call that, a longer key length
means that there are more keys.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.380
As a result, a brute force attack has
to do more work to try all the keys.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.820
This table shows how
much time is required for

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.910
brute force attack for
various key lengths.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.810
As we can see in the table,
DES user key length of 56.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.730
And a number of possible keys,
is 2 to the 56th.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.820
If a single personal computer is
used to try all the possible keys,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.380
it takes about a year.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.550
If multiple PCs, for example, tens of
thousands of PCs, work in parallel,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.086
then the time is drastically shortened.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:31.480
And today's super computers should be
able to try all the possible keys,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.390
using DES, in an hour.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.210
Key sizes of 128 bits or greater
are effectively unbreakable using,

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.810
simply, brute force methods.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.040
For example, even with a super computer,
it would take 10 to 17 years,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.280
to try all the possible keys using AES.
