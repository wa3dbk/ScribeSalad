00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.120
The different pixel measurements in web
development, are actually pretty tricky.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.130
So we're going to go through
a series of quizzes to

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.180
help you understand the differences
between them a little bit better.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.960
For this quiz, there's a mobile
screen with a resolution of

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.200
1920 by 1080 pixels.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.470
What kind of pixels are these
tech specs referring to?

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.220
Are they device independent pixels,
hardware pixels, or CSS pixels?
