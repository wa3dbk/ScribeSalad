Let's stick with alpha equals .05, and decide that at least two of these

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:10.754
college groups are different in terms of the amount of caffeine consumed. Then

00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:14.597
we use a multiple comparisons test to determine which two groups of college

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:19.744
students consume significantly different amounts of caffeine. Here's the

00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:24.330
output, but I've removed some of the values in the mean difference column.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.102
Because I want you to try and figure out what the missing values should be.
