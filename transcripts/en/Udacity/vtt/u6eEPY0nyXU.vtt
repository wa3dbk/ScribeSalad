00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.219
3k squared plus 7k minus 2 plus 3 divided by 4k squared is the correct answer.

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:10.287
That's an amazing work if you got that correct. We know that 12 divided by 4

00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:15.468
equals 3, and k to the 5th divided by k to the 3rd is k squared. 28 divided by 4

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:20.395
equals 7. And we're left with 1k when we compared k to the 4th, to k to the 3rd

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:25.370
we'll have one k left in our numerator. Next we'll have negative 2 for negative

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.612
8 divided by 4. And then the k cubed divided by k cubed equals 1, so we don't

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:34.213
have any variables here. And finally, we're left with 3 4th as a fraction and

00:00:34.213 --> 00:00:38.466
then k squared in the denominator. We have more ks down here then in the

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:43.192
numerator. At these exponents are giving you trouble, it would be a great idea

00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:47.292
to review. Try going back to properties of exponents and solving those problems.
