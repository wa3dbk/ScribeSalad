00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Again this is fairly easy to realize,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because we already have a template up here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So again, we have an index to the list of saved commands,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which we call saved command index.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So, at this moment we are in replay mode.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
While we are in replay mode the original input command function

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
should no longer be called.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
All of the commands should now come from the saved commands in here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's see how this works.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We get the same set of commands now being read

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
from the saved commands variable.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You read a program that is outside of the webpage

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
one would now go and store the saved commands content

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
permanently, say in a file for recording and for replaying.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
One would read this from a file.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
For programs that take text based commands,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
recording and replaying input is fairly easy to realize.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
However, as it comes to reproducing graphical user interaction

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it becomes hard to decide what of events to record and replay.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Suppose you have a graphical user interface for a web browser.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You have a captured replay tool that interposes itself

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
between the user and the program and stores all events

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
coming from the user in an event log such that they can be later replayed.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The problem is: What is the abstraction level

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
you're going to chose for your events?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You could, for instance, go and record mouse clicks to gather with

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the coordinates of the mouse pointer.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is fairly easy to record.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So, for instance, you could go and click here on search

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
at the position, say 100x and 300y.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Or, you could enter some text while the cursor is in the position 200 and 50.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Click here on the file menu or here down on this roll-down menu.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Of course, all of these then go into the event log.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The problem is that for replaying, you need to have the exact

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
same position of every element at the very same position on the screen.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Now suppose your screen resolution changes. or the font size changes.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Then some of the elements will still be more or less in their original positions,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but others won't.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We knew that the mouse click, which previously activated

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
a particular button on the screen, will no longer work

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Likewise, if the position of some elements change,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
then as well, the recorded events will no longer work.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Also, timing can become an issue.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Suppose you recorded a click on this drop-down menu.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Half a second later, when the drop-down menu appeared,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
you clicked on one of the elements in here.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So far, so good.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
This is what you recorded.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Now when you're replaying, and in particular,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
when you are replaying something from a web page,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
it may be that there are delays,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and the drop-down menu will not appear on time.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Then you'd be clicking somewhere completely different when replaying

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the recorded events, which stipulate

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that after half a second you'd click in this very position.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Finally, of course, the program itself may change.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
If the search button is moved from down here to up here,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
then again replaying the event log based on absolute coordinates

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
will click in the wrong position.
