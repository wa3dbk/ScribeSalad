00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.480
To add a dependency to a Gradle project,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.370
we first need to declare the repository
to fetch the dependency from.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.500
The most basic sort of repository
is just a folder full of jars,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.030
which Gradle calls a flat
directory repository.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.800
All repository configuration is done
inside a repositories script block.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.850
For a flat directory repository,
we just add a flat dir block and

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.540
configure the directories
we want to include.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.260
This is great option if you're migrating
an existing project to Gradle, or

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.070
using a dependency if it's not
available from a remote repository.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.790
But it also means you forego
a lot of Gradle's advanced

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.700
dependency management features.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.200
The repository script block also
allows you to use shortcut methods for

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.075
commonly used repositories such as
mavenCentral, mavenLocal, or jcenter.

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:46.565
Simply call the appropriate method, and

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:49.245
the repository will be
automatically added.

00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:52.305
This is by far the most common
way to declare a repository.

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:55.465
Gradle also supports resolving
managed dependencies from Maven and

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:56.972
and IV repositories.

00:00:56.972 --> 00:00:58.952
The syntax for both is the same.

00:00:58.952 --> 00:01:02.712
Simply place your configuration
in Ivy or Maven block.

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:06.172
For both Ivy and Maven repositories,
the only required configuration element

00:01:06.172 --> 00:01:09.360
is the location of the repository,
expressed as a URL.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.240
In some cases, credentials may be
required to access a repository.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.800
You can easily provide a username and

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.650
password by placing them
inside a credentials block.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.600
Gradle supports a number of protocols
for accessing repositories.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.110
In addition to the standard http and
https,

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.310
Gradle also supports sftp and
file-based repositories like this.
