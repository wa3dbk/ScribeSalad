00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.284
The F-statistic we calculated is greater than our critical value. Therefore, we

00:00:05.284 --> 00:00:08.910
reject the null in favor of the alternative. At least one group is

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.598
significantly different. And I think we know which one it is. We easily

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:18.084
realized this, simply using our intuiition at the beginning of the lesson. But

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:22.436
usually the situations we use in ova four are much more complicated, and with

00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:27.926
much larger data sets. And it's impossible to look at lists of hundreds or

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:32.417
thousands of values and just know if they're different. But also in those those

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:36.710
cases, we wouldn't calculate the F-statistic by hand. We would use software.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.614
The purpose of this lesson was mostly for you to understand the reasoning

00:00:40.614 --> 00:00:46.264
behind the F-statistic, and learn how it's calculated. Great job.
