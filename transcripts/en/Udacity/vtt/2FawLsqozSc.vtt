00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.310
We can also compute Cohen's d for multiple comparisions. And remember that this

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.878
is a measure of effect size. You've learned before that Cohen's d is the

00:00:09.878 --> 00:00:14.162
difference between sample means divided by the pooled standard deviation in the

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:21.120
case of independent samples tea tests. You just learned that the square root.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.618
of the means squared for within subject variability is essentially the pooled

00:00:24.618 --> 00:00:30.178
standard deviation. so thats teh formula for co hence d however now we haev

00:00:30.178 --> 00:00:35.659
three samples therefore well compute 3 cohens d one for each pair of samples

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:44.805
compute cohens d for the difference in means going in the direction symbolized
