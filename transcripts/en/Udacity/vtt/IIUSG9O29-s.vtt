00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Norvig] Now, one more thing.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Note that the shuffle routine--both the ones that we wrote

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and the random.shuffle from the standard Python library--return None.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That is, they don't return a useful value; they just return nothing.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And the idea of the shuffle routine is that they modify the input.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So there's this eternal tension in programming between computing a result

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and doing something.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So functions like square root and sine function and so on

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
take an input and return a result.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
They don't modify the input, and they create a new value as a result.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But functions or subroutines or methods like shuffle are different.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
They take an input and modify that input.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
They take the state of the world and do something to the state of the world

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
rather than just compute a result.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We talk of these functions that compute a result as pure functions

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and these that do something as impure,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and I like to talk of them as subroutines rather than functions

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
because they aren't functions in the mathematical sense;

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
they have an effect on the world.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You'll see that most of the code that I show in this class

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
is of the computing type rather than the doing type.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The main reason for this is that the computing code is easier to test.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So if I wanted to write a test for a computing function, for a pure function,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I can do something like assert sorted of the list ([3, 2, 1]) = [1, 2, 3].

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
A single line and I'm done.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
On the other hand, if I want to test a subroutine that does something,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that affects the state of the world, I have to first set up some state.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So let's say input = [3, 2, 1].

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Then I have to call the subroutine or method,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
say input.sort,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and then I have to inspect the state to see what happened.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So I would assert that input is now equal to--oops.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Let's make sure we have double equals signs there.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Input is now equal to [1, 2, 3].

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
In this case there's not that much difference.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We have a library method sort and a built-in function sorted.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
With the built-in function it's a single line to test.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
With the doing subroutine it's 3 lines to test.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But in general, as we add more state and we have functions that do rather than compute,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
it's going to be more work to set up the state, invoke the method, and then test it,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and it's easier to do the test for pure functions.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And that's why I prefer them when they make sense

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and stick to the doing approach only when necessary.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
When there's a lot of state that we have to deal with,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
then we go ahead and write methods or subroutines that modify the state

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
rather than write pure functions.
