00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.450
Task queues allows you to take the job offline, so

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.750
you can create the task queue and then add a

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.580
hundred task that each has the job to send a

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.360
hundred emails. Tasks can be created for many user activity,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.540
and be put on this queue. And as we will

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.690
see later, these tasks are not executed in the user

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.790
request strip. So you can immediately return a response to

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.490
the user, but one question remains then. How will these

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.670
mails be sent? That actually depends on the type of queue you use. But before we

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.210
go into that, it's time for you to answer a question. So the question is which

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.390
is best to use, the HTTP request thread

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.160
or task queues? When you want to generate

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.410
the report, or register a new user, checking

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.330
out the shopping cart, or do photo face recognition?
