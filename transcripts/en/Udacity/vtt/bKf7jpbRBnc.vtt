00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.760
Several factors conspire to make
this process of classification

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.270
much more complicated.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.220
This is as you would expect in AI.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.200
If it was an easy problem
it would not be part of AI.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.950
The first factor that makes this problem
complicated is that one data point

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.690
might be explained by
multiple hypotheses.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.040
So I go to the doctor with high fever,
D5 here,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.020
and several hypotheses about different
diseases might explain my high fever.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.060
Which of this hypotheses, then, is true?

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.860
A second factor that
complicates things is

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.370
that one hypotheses may
explain multiple sets of data.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.230
So the hypotheses that
Ashok has influenza

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.420
might explain not only that he has
fever, but also that he feels tired, and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.172
also that he is shivering, and
also that he can't sleep at night.

00:00:46.172 --> 00:00:50.690
Go to your doctor with two data items,
one that have high fever and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.920
the other that I am tired.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.620
Now the doctor may come
up with a hypothesis, H3,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.155
that Ashok suffers from flu.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:00:59.330
However, when H3 is present,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.930
then one can expect other
symptoms to be observed as well.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.613
However, the hypothesis of H3
may generate expectations but

00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:08.800
additional data items.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.530
How, then,
may a doctor decide if H3 is true?

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.700
Well, one possibility is that
a doctor may ask Ashok additional

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.180
questions to collect additional data.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.915
Do you shiver at night, the doctor may
ask, if that is one of the expectations

00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:23.960
generated by the hypothesis
of having flu.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.380
because the mapping is not only from
the data space to the hypothesis space,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.910
the mapping is also from the hypothesis
space to the data space.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.540
Diagnosis entails not only mapping
data to hypothesis, but also to

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.460
know the expectations of additional data
and, collecting that additional data.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.810
Of course, both of the first two factors
may be present at the same time.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.990
That is, one hypothesis may
explain multiple data items.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.800
And multiple hypothesis may
explain the same data item.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.310
So, in general,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.730
this is a M to M mapping, multiple
hypothesis, multiple sets of data.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.810
And, of course, this immediately
makes the diagnostic task harder.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.270
The fourth factor that makes
the diagnostic task hard is that

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.710
these hypothesis could
interact with each other.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.880
One of the common interactions between
hypotheses is called mutual exclusion.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.030
Mutual exclusion occurs if
one hypothesis present,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.040
another hypothesis cannot be true.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.020
In this case, H3 explains D2, D3, D4.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.100
And H6 expands D of 6, D of 7, D of 8.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.540
But if H3 is present, H6 cannot be true.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.150
And if H6 is present, H3 cannot be true.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.490
This makes the diagnostic task hard
because if a patient goes to a doctor

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.720
with symptoms D3, D4 and D6, D7, then
the question becomes whether to include

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.160
H3 or
to include H6 to define our conclusion.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.240
A fifth factor that makes the diagnostic
test hard is called cancellation.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.180
Cancellation occurs when
two hypotheses interact

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.200
relative to a particular data item.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.190
As an example, I may have flu, which
tends to increase a temperature, but

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.340
I may also have a lowered
immune function,

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.260
which tends not to show
higher temperature.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.510
As a result, I may not show high fever,
but it's not because I don't have flu.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.410
It's much more because
the symptoms of flu and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.960
the symptoms of lowered immune function
are cancelling out each other.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.630
&gt;&gt; So, we also saw this
in our initial exercise.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.810
We chose Thetadesis as the most
parsimonious hypothesis for these data.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.870
But imagine if we didn't
have that as an option.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.890
If we didn't have Thetadesis, we may
have said that it's Betatosis, Iotalgia,

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.490
and Kappacide, because the elevated
A we see in Iotalgia cancels out

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.650
the reduced A we see in Kappacide, which
would account for our normal A levels.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.595
&gt;&gt; In general, cancel interactions
are very hard to account for.

00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:38.095
In order to address these
factors that make diagnosis so

00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:42.325
complex, it is useful to shift from
the perspective of diagnostics solely

00:03:42.325 --> 00:03:45.865
as classification to a perspective
of diagnostics as abduction.
