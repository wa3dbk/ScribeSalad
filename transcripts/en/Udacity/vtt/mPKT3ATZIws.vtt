If you've taken a Udacity class before, you've probably seen the Udacity IDE--well, IDE.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's a webpage where you can enter arbitrary Python functions

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and Python commands and execute them.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For instance, we can have it say hello for some wrong and then we get the output hello.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let us now write a function which implements the finite state machine we just seen

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in order to remove HTML markup.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We have the tag variable, which tells us which state we're in,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and we have an out variable, which tells us what the output would be.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Here's an implementation of the finite state machine.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If we see the beginning of an HTML tag, we set the tag variable to two, so we go into tag mode.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If we see the end of HTML markup, we set tag to false, so we exit tag mode.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Otherwise, for all other characters, we add them to the output unless we're in tag mode.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And finally, we return the output. Here's the input we just saw.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We have a bold HTML tag, we have a foo as text,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and we have an end-of-bold HTML markup in here.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If all works well, then we should get just foo as the output

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and all the HTML markup should be removed.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So we take on run and we get foo as the output--that is I removed HTML markup function,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
has properly stripped the bold and unbold markup from the input.
