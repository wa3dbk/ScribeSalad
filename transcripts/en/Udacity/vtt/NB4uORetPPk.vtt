00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.740
OK I like the way this class diagram is

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.850
coming along. So at this point I think we

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.300
have all the classes that we need. For each

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.250
class we specified the attributes or the characteristics of the

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.150
class. And we also specified the operations so we

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.710
know what the class can do And, I like to

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.110
kind of move forward on this, but I first

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.690
want to see that you're fine with the class structure.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.500
So that's the way the class structure is going

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.880
to be in terms of attributes and operations. So anything

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.910
that bothers you? Well, one thing I didn't understand

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.090
is how come you put check out over where

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.350
the patron when it's really the item being checked

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.280
out? Right. Okay. So that actually is you know, is a perfect

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.030
segway for the next thing that really wanted

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.780
to model. Because what you're talking about is basically a

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.100
relationship between two classes which is something we haven't touched on

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.582
yet. So we haven't, haven't looked at individual classes. But now, it

00:00:57.582 --> 00:01:00.720
is typical, now we are looking more at requirements, we're starting to

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.800
find more things about our system, and what you're pointed out right

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.370
now is the fact that patron and item are somehow related. So

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.020
this checkout operation is not really something that belongs only on in

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.660
the patron, because it needs to know about the item. And it

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.790
doesn't belong only on the item because it needs to know about

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.640
the patron. So, it's something that associates the patron and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.600
the item. Okay. And that's exactly the way we call

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.630
in the UML which is the notation that we're using

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.060
here this kind of relationship. So, we're going to represent that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.820
by drawing a line between these two classes that tells

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.220
us there is an association. And we're also going to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.890
give a name to this. Since this refers to the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.280
fact of checking out items. We're just going to call

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.794
it, checkout. Gotcha. And notice that this basically you

00:01:43.794 --> 00:01:48.500
know,eventually will end up kind of replacing this attribute. Because

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.780
the existence of this association will tell us that

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.932
this is checked out. We're, we're not going to, you know,

00:01:53.932 --> 00:01:55.428
do it right now, but in the final cleanup

00:01:55.428 --> 00:01:58.750
or the diagram, this name will disappear. Okay. Okay.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.190
And so since we started talking about relationships and

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.280
associations, is there any other kind of relationship that you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.805
see here? Well, what you just did with checked

00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:12.009
out is, it seems similar to the whole issue

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:16.090
of requests. It is, it is. So a request

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.580
is something else that happens in both, you know, in

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.090
the patron and in the item, it involves both.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.070
And in fact in a request, I would definitely

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.950
represent this as an additional association. So I will

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.730
just draw an another line between these two that represent

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.804
that specific kind of relationship and I will call it

00:02:33.804 --> 00:02:37.330
request. So that indicates that this association refers to a

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.660
request that also connects the patron with an item. Okay.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.710
And, let's see. Any, anything else that jumps at you?

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.590
Yeah, well, how about all these ones down at the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.080
bottom? I mean book and item's got to be

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.920
related, right? A book is a kind of item, And

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.860
audiovisual... are there associations between them? Can you repeat

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.790
that, you said that the book, yeah? Is

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.550
a kind of item. Perfect, that's exactly what we're

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.700
modeling next, which is, this, what we call the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.900
is-a relationship. So you said, a book is an item?

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.346
A book is an item. And, we can model that in the diagram. So, we do that

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:17.409
using another kind of relationship between the classes. So

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.210
we're going to represent that as a specialization we call it.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.890
And, a specialization is indicated in this way. Okay?

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.410
With this arrow at the end, so a solid

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.800
with this kind of arrow at the end. And

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.160
we can do the same for book, magazine, reference book

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.200
and audiovisual material. So we're all going to connect,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.950
we're going to connect all of them, to the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.190
item, using the same kind of connection. And now

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.200
that we have connected all these four, with item

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.620
and indicated them in subclasses. That's something else that we can

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.370
do. So we can make this kind of cleaner. And I'll

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.360
tell you what I mean by that. So now we have

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.190
this loanable attribute that refers to item, but it seems to

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.100
me from what you were saying before, that loanable is not

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.490
really an attribute of an item. Right? It's more of a

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.240
characteristic of the type of item. Right. Is that right? Right.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.120
Books, and audio/visual are loanable but the others aren't.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.450
Okay, and so representing it here, it's okay to,

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.579
it will work. But it's not really right so from

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.590
the style standpoint it doesn't really you know,

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.100
it's not the best way of modeling this. What we're going to

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.130
do instead, we're going to use this specialization relationship to make

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.000
that more explicit. To make it cleaner. Okay, so what

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.300
I'm doing here is I'm going to take this hierarchy

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.130
of classes, this is just on two levels now, and I'm

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.380
going to kind of make it a little richer.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.470
So I'm going to add an intermediate set of

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.756
classes. And in particular I'm going to have these two

00:04:45.756 --> 00:04:48.306
classes that I'm going to call non loanable item and loanable

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:51.790
item. So, they're both items but they tell me

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.490
clearly that some items are loanable and some items

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.392
are not. Okay. Okay. And then I'm simply going to

00:04:59.392 --> 00:05:03.192
put book and audio video material as subclasses of loanable

00:05:03.192 --> 00:05:07.980
item and reference book and magazine as subclasses of non-loanable

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.510
item. So, if we look at this diagram now it's

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.650
pretty clear what is loanable and what is not. And

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.070
it's actually is a very clean, much cleaner

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.980
design. And, and I see you've, gotten rid of

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.560
the loanable attribute, too. I did. Because at

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.130
this point this is already represented by the fact of

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.570
having these two classes. And actually, something else that I did

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.820
is that I moved all these attributes, value,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.220
due date, renewed and checked out, that makes

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.452
sense only for loanable item. From item to

00:05:37.452 --> 00:05:40.450
loanable item. So at this point, this really

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.600
is telling me that, you know, these

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.410
characteristics are just meaningful for the loanable item,

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:53.800
and not for the other ones. Well, speaking of that, the way that you got the

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.270
lines going in the diagram here is you still have

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.920
request and checked out going to item, even though you

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.610
can't request non loanable Items. You can't check out non

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.630
loanable Items. Oh, you were right actually. You got me on

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.940
that one. You're exactly right. So this associations are between

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.440
the two wrong classes. So, I guess, at this point,

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.450
you can probably go and fix the diagram yourself. Well,

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.120
can we just make the lines go from patron to loanable

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.640
item instead of to item? That's exactly the way in which we

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.550
are going to fix it. So, we're going to move these two associations down

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.190
here. And at this point, this will represent the right relationships in

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.850
the, in the diagram, and in the system. Makes sense to me.
