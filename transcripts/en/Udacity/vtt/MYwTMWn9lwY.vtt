00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.790
F of 2 equals eight, g of 2 equals 3, and f plus g of 2 equals 11. Nice

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.738
thinking if you got all 3 correct. To find the f of 2, we'll start by plugging

00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:17.232
the value of 2 in for X. So we'll have 3 times 2, which equals 6 plus 2, which

00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:22.760
equals 8. So when the input of the function x equals 2, the output of the

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.488
function is 8. For g of 2 we'll use a similar approach. We'll plug in the value

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:35.267
of 2 in for x, so we'll have g of two equals 2 squared minus 1. 2 squared

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:41.713
equals 4, minus 1 is 3. So, we know that g of 2 is 3. And for this last one it

00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:45.532
just means we want to take the value of f of 2 and add it to the value of g of

00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:51.364
2. We're wondering what's the sum of the outputs, when both functions are

00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:56.660
evaluated at x equals 2? Well, we know f of 2 equals 8 and we know g of 2

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.009
equals 3. So we're really just adding these two outputs together to get 11, and

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:09.030
we can also see this on a graph. Here I've graphed f of x and g of x in Desmos.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.339
F of x is this straight orange line and g of x is this curved parabola. Notice

00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:21.028
that the f of 2, or the output for the orange function when x equals 2. Is

00:01:21.028 --> 00:01:26.667
positive 8 right here. If I zoom out, you can see that more clearly. And notice

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:34.348
that the output for g of x, when x equals 2, is positive 3 here. So, we're just

00:01:34.348 --> 00:01:40.052
going to add the output here of 8 to the output here of 3. When we add the two

00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:44.043
outputs together, we'll get 11.
