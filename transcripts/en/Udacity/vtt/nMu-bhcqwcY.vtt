00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.616
This matrix is not a quaternion. No matrix is a quaternion, not even a rotation

00:00:04.616 --> 00:00:08.407
matrix. A rotation transform can be represented by a rotation matrix. A

00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:12.380
quaternion is an alternate representative for a rotation transform. The

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.400
transpose of a translation matrix puts its translation values in the bottom row

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.787
of the matrix. The only type of matrix that puts its values in this area is a

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:23.543
projective matrix. So of these three types of matrices, the only correct one is

00:00:23.543 --> 00:00:27.140
projective matrix. To be honest, I don't know what sort of projection that would

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.666
do. Its not what we normally run into in computer graphics. But it definitely is

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:31.733
a projection of some sort.
