00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.500
So once again recapping what we said. The sources of RPC latency are

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.557
the following. Marshaling and data copying. Context switches,

00:00:10.557 --> 00:00:15.340
both at the client side and the server side. Similarly marshaling and

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.540
data copying also happens both in the client

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.540
side and the server side. And the actual protocol

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.160
processing in order to send the packet on

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.290
the wire. These are all the things that are

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.650
happening in software. Those are the things that

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.290
as OS designers, we have a chance to

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.180
do something about. And what we saw were

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.300
techniques that we can employ for each one of

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.080
those, reduce the number of copies, reduce the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.990
number of context switches, and make the protocol

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.390
processing lean and mean so that the latency

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.700
involved in RPC is reduced to as minimum as

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.404
possible from the software side. And we are going

00:00:53.404 --> 00:00:56.400
to take whatever the hardware gives us. If the

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.650
hardware gives us an ability to, to do DMA

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.470
from the client buffer, we'll use that but if it

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.129
doesn't, then we have to anchor that. So that's

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.260
what we are seeing here. As the opportunities for

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.600
reducing the total latency in going from the client

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.240
to the server and back to the client in RPC.
