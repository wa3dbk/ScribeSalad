00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.660
You have done well to get this far.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.630
Your skills, they are strong,
you are ready.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.508
It is time, time to disable
Force update on page load.

00:00:11.508 --> 00:00:14.593
Now the service worker
lifecycle is back to normal,

00:00:14.593 --> 00:00:17.198
which is how real users
will experience it.

00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:20.660
You see, force update is
great during development.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.750
Say we wanted to change
the theme of the app.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.370
The theme colors are in
public/scss/theme.scss.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.311
These are a set of Sass variables
referenced throughout the rest of

00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:31.158
the style sheets.

00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:36.258
If I change the primary color to
red then go back to the browser

00:00:36.258 --> 00:00:41.458
with force update enabled and
refresh, boom, red toolbar.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:45.114
But this is because force update
reloads the service worker

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:47.380
from the network on every refresh and

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.418
causes it to install even if
the service worker hasn't changed.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:54.850
Let's say I change the whole theme by
uncommenting this other set of variables

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.350
here, which should make the theme green.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.340
But this time,
I'll disable Force update on page load.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.610
Refresh the page, and still red.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.448
No matter how many times I refresh,
still red.

00:01:06.448 --> 00:01:11.170
If I Shift+refresh and bypass
the service worker, I see the changes.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.250
But normal refreshing gets me nowhere,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.080
because our cache still
contains the old CSS.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.860
Our cached CSS is updated as
part of the install step.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.080
But that isn't happening,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.680
because there's no new
service worker to install.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.400
We can see from dev tools,
there's no new service worker waiting.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.490
Without force update,
the browser checks for

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.830
an update to the service
worker per page load.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.220
But I didn't change the service worker,
I only changed the CSS, so

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.958
there's nothing new to install.

00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.910
We need to work with the service
worker to get it to pick up changes,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.950
because we're developers, right?

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.498
We change code all the time.

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:45.850
And we need users to get those
changes as soon as possible with

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.108
minimum disruption.

00:01:47.108 --> 00:01:49.540
Here's how we work with
the service worker lifecycle.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.360
To get the CSS to update, we need to
make a change to the service worker.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.908
The browser will then treat this
updated worker as a new version.

00:01:57.908 --> 00:02:01.833
Because it's new, it'll get its own
install event where it'll fetch

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:06.400
the JavaScript, HTML, and our updated
CSS and put them in a new cache.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.919
It won't put them in a different
cache automatically.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.358
We changed the name of our
cache to make this happen.

00:02:11.358 --> 00:02:15.082
We create a new cache because we don't
want to disrupt the cache that's already

00:02:15.082 --> 00:02:18.318
there being used by the old service
worker and the pages it controls.

00:02:18.318 --> 00:02:22.479
Then, once the old service worker is
released and we're ready to take over,

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:26.704
we delete the old cache so the next page
load gets resources from the new cache,

00:02:26.704 --> 00:02:29.050
meaning it gets the latest CSS.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.422
Job done.

00:02:30.422 --> 00:02:33.171
We've already covered most of
the parts needed to make this happen.

00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:36.307
We know that a change to the service
worker will cause it to spin up a new

00:02:36.307 --> 00:02:36.858
instance.

00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:41.037
And that change can just be
renaming the cache from v1 to v2.

00:02:41.037 --> 00:02:45.278
The bit we haven't covered is how
to get rid of that old cache.

00:02:45.278 --> 00:02:48.008
The first piece of the puzzle
is the activate event.

00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.091
We've already seen the install event,

00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:54.011
which fires when the browser sets up
a new service worker for the first time,

00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:57.933
whereas the activate event fires when
this service worker becomes active,

00:02:57.933 --> 00:03:01.818
when it's ready to control pages and
the previous service worker is gone.

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:05.130
This makes it the perfect time
to get rid of old caches.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.420
Like the install event,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.260
you can use event.waitUntil to
signal the length of the process.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.380
While you're activating,

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.780
the browser will queue other service
worker events such as fetch.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.540
So by the time your service
worker receives its first fetch,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.450
you know you have the caches
how you want them.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.670
You can delete caches
using caches.delete,

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.530
passing in the name of the cache.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.490
You can also get the names of all
your caches using caches.keys.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.320
Both of these methods return promises.
