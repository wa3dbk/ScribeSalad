00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.430
We can also encode data into our

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.922
visualization using color. We can typically include

00:00:06.922 --> 00:00:09.710
values with color in 2 different ways,

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.900
hue and saturation. They can be used individually

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.550
or in combination. Color hue is what we typically refer to as color like red

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.880
or green or blue. Different colors used

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.450
together usually in the key categorical data where

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.610
each color represents different group. So if we're

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.270
using our baseball data maybe green is short

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.880
stops, red is outfielders and orange is second

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.170
basemen, something like that. Saturation is the intensity of

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.400
color for a given hue. So if you select a color as blue, high saturation will be

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.340
very blue and the color would look faded

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.150
as you decrease your saturation. We usually use saturation

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.280
to encode intensity or quantity of a value. So

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.210
maybe if we were encoding the number of home runs

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.940
with saturation, more home runs would be darker and fewer

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.069
home runs would lighter. Or, if we were encoding Aadhaar

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.340
enrollments, more enrollments would be darker and fewer enrollments

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.240
would be lighter. We could also use hue and saturation

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.710
in combination. So you can see here that no hue

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.220
and no saturation is set to 0 and in this

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.700
particular encoding, the more saturated our purple-like color is,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.380
the more negative we are. And the more saturated

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.690
our green-like color is, the more positive we are.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.250
This might accentuate the differences in value and tell

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.540
us when the value is positive or negative and

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.990
how intense the absolute value of that effect is.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.170
When using color to encode information, a pretty good

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.230
general rule of thumb is that you shouldn't use more

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.590
than a dozen colors to encode categories effectively. If

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.900
you were to use more than 12 colors, it might

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.700
be hard to quickly differentiate between categories, and your visualization

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.070
is going to become a little bit harder to parse.
