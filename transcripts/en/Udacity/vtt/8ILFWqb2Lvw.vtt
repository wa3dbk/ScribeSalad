The first thing I'd like you to do in Homework 6 is add some caching to your blog.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Specifically, I'd like you to cache the front page and display on the front page somewhere,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
how long ago you ran that query that generated the front page.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let me give you a little demo on my site of what this looks like.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So here we are at udacity-cs253.com/blog.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If I reload this page--let's go down to the bottom--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
you will see that this query, this page was generated 159 seconds ago.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If I were to reload this page again, you could see that it's incrementing every time I reload the page.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Okay. So obviously, I'm storing this in the cache somewhere and that's what I would like you to do.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
When you have this working, submit the URL to your blog here.
