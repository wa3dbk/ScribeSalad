00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
There are lots and lots of other interesting applications of asymmetric cryptography.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We'll see some of those later in unit 5,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but for now I want to focus on how to actually build an asymmetric cryptosystem.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What we want to build is what's known as a "trap door" one-way function.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
A one-way function would be a function that is easy to compute in one direction

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and hard to compute in another direction.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
With asymmetric crypto we need to reveal this function.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We want the reverse to still be hard, but we want some way to be able to do the reverse easily

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
if we know some secret. That's our trap door.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We want to be able to--if you have some secret key, you can do the inverse.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If you don't, you can't. That's what makes an asymmetric cryptosystem.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's hard to do in the reverse direction unless you have this extra key.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But revealing the easy way to do the forward direction

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
does not reveal the easy way to do the reverse direction.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Diffe and Hellman envisioned such a cryptosystem

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
in the 1976 paper that we talked about last unit,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but they didn't devise a function that had this property.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The first cryptosystem to successfully have this property, is the RSA cryptosystem.

00:01:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That'll be the focus for the rest of this unit.
