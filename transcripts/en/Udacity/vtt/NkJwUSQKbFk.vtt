00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.070
If you have trouble picturing this think about a mountain climber. It would be

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.166
harder for a mountain climber to walk from left to right across this graph than

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:11.757
it would for someone to walk from left to right on this graph but we're

00:00:11.757 --> 00:00:15.852
mathematicians and it's not enough to know that this line is steeper than this

00:00:15.852 --> 00:00:19.782
line. I want to know how much steeper, I need a way of quantifying steepness In

00:00:19.782 --> 00:00:24.235
algebra we use something called slope. Slope compares the distant a line rises

00:00:24.235 --> 00:00:28.941
or falls to the distance aligned runs from left to right. We write slope as the

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:33.890
ratio of rise divided by run. For example, let's look at this line. We'll look

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.684
at the graph between x equals 0 and x equals 1, so we're between here. In this

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:43.519
region we have a run of 1 so I'll put 1 in the denominator. How much would this

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.940
rise be? Use the graph to help you out.
