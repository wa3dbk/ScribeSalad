00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.804
This goes out to all my students around the world. Hm[MUSIC] So you got some

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:12.356
sample mean x bar is 5 and the size of 17. Is this typical? Well, what you

00:00:12.356 --> 00:00:18.100
gotta know? The sampling distribution is the way to go.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.740
&gt;&gt; Way to go. You've got the sampling. Distribution 09 to 0. So you got some

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.216
population mu1, sigma 2, you need a derivation for the standard deviation. Need

00:00:31.216 --> 00:00:37.207
motivation it's as simple as pi. Sigma divided by root n. Why? 'Cuz it's the

00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:42.662
central limit theorem. Now find your z, subtract the mean and divide by se,

00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:49.840
what's the probability? It's not a lot. Less than alpha level, you reject H0.
