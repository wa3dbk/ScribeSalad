00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.477
It would take Lucy 2 hours, and Javier 3 hours. Great thinking if you found

00:00:04.477 --> 00:00:08.799
these numbers. We want to keep in mind that t represents the number of hours it

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:14.298
takes for Lucy to mow the yard alone. So when we solve for t in this equation,

00:00:14.298 --> 00:00:19.690
we'll find Lucy's time. To begin solving this equation, we want to multiply

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.700
through by the LCD, which is 1 and 2 10ths times t times t plus 1. It's the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.950
product of these 3 denominators since they're all different and the greatest

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.530
common factor is 1. When we multiply through by the LCD, we'll see that the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.350
factors cancel. The t's will cancel. The quantity t plus 1 will reduce to 1.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.480
And then number 1.2 or 1 and 2 10ths reduces to 1 as well. This leaves us with

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.813
1 and 2 10ths times t plus 1 here. 1 and 2 10th here and the quantity, t plus 1

00:00:49.813 --> 00:00:55.477
times t here. We'll distribute the 1 and 2 10th and the t to the terms to get

00:00:55.477 --> 00:01:00.386
this equation. Then we'll combine the like terms on the left hand side to get 2

00:01:00.386 --> 00:01:06.880
and 4 10th times t, plus 1 and 2 10th equals t squared plus 2. To get rid of

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.480
these decimals, we'll multiply through by 10. So we'll have 24t plus 12 equals

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.766
10t squared plus 10t. Now we have a quadratic equation that we can try and

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:21.555
factor. We want to move all of these terms to the right hand side and then see

00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:27.173
if we can factor. So, subtracting 24t and 12, we'll get 10t squared, minus 14t,

00:01:27.173 --> 00:01:34.708
minus 12 on the right hand side of our equation. And we'll get 0 on the left. I

00:01:34.708 --> 00:01:38.410
notice that all of these terms are even. So I can divide my entire equation by

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.472
2. 0 divided by 2 is 0. And then I divide each of these terms by 2. From this

00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:49.282
quadratic equation, we use factoring by grouping to get the factors of 5t plus

00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:55.174
3, and t minus 2. We set each of these factors equal to zero and then we solve

00:01:55.174 --> 00:01:59.880
for the values of t. We find that t can equal positive 2, or t can equal

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.880
negative 3 5ths. We know that t represents the time for Lucy to mow the yard so

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.259
we don't want to use this negative value, it wouldn't make sense here. Instead,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.519
we'll use t equals 2. So, she takes 2 hours to mow the yard. If we remember,

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.299
Javier's time was t plus 1, he took an hour longer than Lucy, so this would

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:24.588
mean he would mow the yard in 3 hours. We just needed to add 1 on to Lucy's

00:02:24.588 --> 00:02:25.590
time.
