00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.080
Let us now turn to the third problem solving method under this topic called

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.710
problem reduction. The method of problem reduction actually is quite intuitive.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.910
I'm sure you use it all the time. Given the hard complex problem, reduce it.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.330
Decompose it into multiple easier, smaller, simpler problems. Consider, for

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.970
example, computer programming or software design that I'm sure many of you do

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.860
all the time. Given a hard part of the address, you decompose it

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.216
with a series of smaller problems. How do I read the input? How do I process it?

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:38.470
How do I write the output? That itself is a decomposition. In fact,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.920
one of the fundamental roles that knowledge plays is it tells you how to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.230
decompose a hard problem into simpler problems.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.012
Then once you have solutions to this simpler smaller problems.

00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:54.190
You can think about how to compose the sub-solutions to the sub-problems into

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.490
a solution of the problem as a whole. That's how problem reduction works.
