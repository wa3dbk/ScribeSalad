00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In lecture, you mentioned that the one-time pad is the only perfect cipher.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
TimeZombie writes wanting to know why this is true.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I probably overstated things a little bit saying

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
this is the only perfect cipher, that you could certainly

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
construct ciphers that are perfect and are not exactly

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the same as the one-time pad as we've described it.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But they'd be essentially the same, and what Claude Shannon proved

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
is that to be a perfect cipher, you have to have

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the key space as large as the message space,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and you can never reuse a key, so every byte of the message

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
corresponds to a byte of the key, and then with the one-time pad,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we're XORing that we could do some other operations

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that would be equivalent of XOR and have another cipher that would be perfect.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But the important thing that was proven is that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
if the key is smaller than the message, there's no way for the cipher to be perfect.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There must be some information leaking to an attacker

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that potentially could be used to break it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Okay, and then as a followup to that,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
he also wanted you to comment on quantum cryptography.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Okay, so quantum cryptography is a very interesting topic,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and there's really two sides to that that people think about.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The first is quantum key distribution,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
which is to take advantage of properties of quantum physics

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to be able to send a message where even if someone intercepts it,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
they cannot replay it, and that means that the two parties at the end

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
can know that if they establish a key,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
if that message got through between them and they can verify

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that they received the right message, that there was no

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
physical way it could be eavesdropped on because the properties

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
of quantum physics are that if you observe properties about a photon,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
you can observe some parts of it, but you can't observe the whole thing.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You can observe, say, both the momentum and the spin at the same time,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and I'm not an expert in quantum physics, so that may not be exactly right

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but you can't observe--and this is Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle--

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
you can't observe every property of the photon at the same time,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
so you can set things up, and I won't go into details of that now.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We may talk about that in one of the--maybe Unit 7.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I think that would be a good topic to bring up again

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and go into a little bit more detail.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The other interest is in quantum computing,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
which potentially offers a way to solve problems

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that we can't solve with classical computers in an efficient way.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And the most interesting question there is factoring,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
which in Unit 4 we'll talk about the importance of factoring

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
being hard for breaking RSA for the security of RSA

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
relying on it being hard to factor numbers

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that are multiples of 2 large primes.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
There are ways--if you have a quantum computer--to do factoring efficiently

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
in a polynomial number of steps which no one knows

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the way to do with a classical computer.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
If it was possible to build a large quantum computer,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
which no one has been able to do yet but in theory could be done,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
then you could break crypto systems like RSA

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that depend on factoring being hard because you could factor large numbers

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
using your quantum computer.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Both of those are sort of interesting aspects where

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the sort of deep properties of quantum physics can be used

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
either to the advantage of making something more secure

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
or to the advantage of the attacker.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And we'll talk about the impact of quantum computing

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
on factoring a little bit in Unit 4.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Okay, cool. I look forward to it, thank you.
