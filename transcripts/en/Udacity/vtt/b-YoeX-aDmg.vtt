00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is a quick overview on the concept of velocity,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which is more or less the same as the concept of derivative,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which could be called rate of change in general terms.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If you are already acquainted with that, you may want to skip to the quiz.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Imagine this situation: that we have a high-speed train on the track

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that is labeled from -100 km to +100 km.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So the track is 200 km long.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And this is our timetable.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The train starts here at -100 km, and drives at a pretty high speed

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
'til 1½ hours after the start.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Then it stops at this position, 50 km.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It continues somewhat slower for 1 hour, 'til it reaches that position at +100 km.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Then it immediately returns to the position x = 0,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
4 hours after it started.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is, if you will, a mathematical view of the train's time table.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's rotate this by 90° to get something that's more typical for physics.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So now I've taken this diagram and rotated it by 90°

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to come up with that diagram.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The t-axis now points to the right, and the x-axis now points upward.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We can create a second diagram from that that shows the velocity.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So here the train advances at 100 km/h, here it's just 50 km/h.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Here the train goes backward with 100 km/h.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So maybe a good idea is to label this axis with +100 km/h and -100 km/h.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So here we have a velocity of +100 km/h, here too,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and then the train stops, which means we have a velocity of 0.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And here the train starts again and makes 50 km/h

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
which is just half as much as before.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And here we are going backward with 100 km/h as its speed,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
so the velocity is -100 km/h.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This is what the velocity looks like.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So if you're going forward, it's positive, if you're going backward, its negative.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So what we see here is the velocity of the train, depending on time.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
That's nothing but the rate of change of the position, which we call x,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
by how much does x change if a certain amount of time passes.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The rate of change would be the ratio.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
For instance, this ratio: 100 km divided by 1 hour -- the velocity of 100 km/h.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
In this case, the ratio would be 50 km divided by 1 hour; 50 km/h.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So what we are drawing here is the rate of change of the x position,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
nothing but the velocity, and this is the very same as the derivative.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The derivative tells us the local rate of change.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Here the derivative is 100 km/h, here it's 0, here it's 50 km/h, and here it's negative.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
As the time advances, the x position decreases.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
A negative derivative, negative velocity, negative rate of change.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The standard way of writing that: v of t, the velocity depending on t.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000
One way of writing it is dx of t by dt, or x prime of t,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
or, and this is what the physicists are using, x dot of t.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I'm going to stick to that notation.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Whenever physicists want to compute the rate of change

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
with respect to time, they put a dot on top of that variable.
