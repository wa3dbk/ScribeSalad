00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.465
So 3.14, is greater than this z critical value for an alpha level of 0.001. So,

00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:14.908
a z score of 3.14 occurs out here somewhere in the green region. So this is

00:00:14.908 --> 00:00:24.660
significant at probability less than 0.001. And 2.07 is between 1.65 and 2.32.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.220
So that z score, occurs somewhere in this red region. So it's significant at p

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.626
less than .05. Hopefully this is making sense. Let's do that last two. 2.57

00:00:36.626 --> 00:00:43.178
will occur somewhere in this blue region, because that z score is in between

00:00:43.178 --> 00:00:51.785
2.32 and 3.08. So the probability of getting this z score is 0.01. And finally,

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:56.360
this is a really huge z score so, this sample mean occurs somewhere way out

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.638
here, far from the mean. But we don't conventionally have an alpha level that

00:01:02.638 --> 00:01:07.174
is that small, so we'll just say that the probability of getting that sample

00:01:07.174 --> 00:01:13.718
mean, is less than 0.001, good job. So just to recap, if our sample mean falls

00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:18.140
in the critical region, for an alpha level of 0.05, It's unlikely and therefore

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.300
probably didn't occur by chance. Something's going on, and there are different

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.323
levels that help us decide how sure we are.
