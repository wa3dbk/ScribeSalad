00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.180
So let's take a look, is this statement

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.296
correct? No, because here we're passing the userId,

00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:09.230
and that's not correct. We have to pass

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.840
the key of the ancestor. So here, is this

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.280
code correct? We are passing the userKey, so

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.830
that's right, but, oh, something's missing here, it

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.730
needs to be conference.class not just conference. And

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.630
here, this is right. We're loading type Conference.class, and

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.120
we're passing the ancestor key. Correct. And

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.180
over here in the conferenceapi.java file, have a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.891
quick look at the definition for getConferencesCreated. Again,

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:40.670
we annotate it as @ApiMethod,. Specify the name,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.770
the path, and the HTTPMethod post. So this time because we need the user to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.880
be locked in, we do pass the user

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.090
argument and we have to throw an UnauthorizedException

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.590
in case that user is not logged in. So here's the code, should be very familiar

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.250
by now. For throwing the exception if the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.560
user's not logged in. We get the user ID,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.340
getUserId, we get the key of the user from their ID,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.120
because remember, we use the userId to generate the key and here we do the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.291
query. We load ofy.load.type Conference.class, specify the userKey

00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:20.800
as the ancestor. To order by name, and then

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.120
finally, we execute the list to actually run the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.140
query. After you deploy your app to localhost, you

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.350
can test it in the API's explorer. So here's the

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.320
conference API. Here you see the getConferencesCreated method that

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.860
you just defined. You are going to need to make

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.030
sure that you refresh your browser, or you won't

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.550
see it. Drill down into it, I'm going to execute it.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.280
Oh look, forgot to authorize maps because we required the user argument. If

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.840
I authorize, now I'll try again, and here I

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.550
see in the response, the conferences that I've created.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.916
So the UI calls the same function. It calls

00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:03.570
the getConferencesCreated. You could also use the Conferences Created

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.540
page in the UI. Because when you go to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.900
that tab, it actually calls the same method that

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.270
you've just created. You can use whichever you prefer,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.940
the tab in the UI or the API's explorer,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.180
to check that the function works.
