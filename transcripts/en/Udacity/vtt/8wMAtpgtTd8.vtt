00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.330
So now that we've talked about all the elements of a good experimental study,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.150
let's put it all together into an experiment. So what we're going to do is

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.040
begin our experiment the way all psychology experiments do. By getting the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.380
informed consent from our participants. Informed consent means that the

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.565
participant is aware of all the requirements of the study and agrees to

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:24.120
participate. Once they've given us consent. We decided we're going to randomly

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.260
put our participants into groups by flipping a coin to ensure that it's

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.190
randomly assigned. Because this is a single blind study, we know who's going to

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.390
be in the control group and we know who's going to be in the experimental

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.625
group. In the experimental group again, is those who get caffeine. In the

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:46.130
control group, they don't get caffeine. Everything other than the independent

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.000
variable has to be the same in both groups. So, our next step is to measure

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.880
their reaction time. To do this, we use a reaction time test online. When the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.800
screen changes from white to black, the participant has to click. We took the

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.090
average of five trials from each participant. You can try this test on your own
