00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:04.748
To begin, let's take a look at
this simple, unstyled webpage.

00:00:04.748 --> 00:00:06.655
Looks pretty plain, doesn't it?

00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:09.090
Wouldn't it be better if we
could add some style to it?

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.750
Maybe we could lay out the content
differently, use a different font, or

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.040
emphasize different elements.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.750
CSS can help us do just that.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.261
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets,
is the markup language that we use

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:26.678
to describe how elements
on websites should look.

00:00:26.678 --> 00:00:29.458
CSS is all about style.

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:31.580
Look at YouTube's home page.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.250
With CSS,
it can control things like color,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.310
spacing, fonts, and
layouts for their website.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.130
What makes CSS so
powerful is it gives you,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.890
the web developer, the ability to change
the look of elements on the page.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.170
CSS is also nice because it let's us
separate the description of the content

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.170
we want on the page, the HTML,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.150
from the description of how we want the
content to look on the page, the CSS.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.780
Let's look at an example.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.510
This is Yahoo's home page, but what if I
looked at Yahoo's home page without CSS?

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.210
What would it look like?

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.770
Whoa, looks pretty weird, doesn't it?

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.930
The content is still here,
but it looks terrible.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.910
What happened to the navigation
at the top, the menu on the side,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.030
the search bar, and the news stories?

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.290
Well, this is the beauty of CSS.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.690
Literally all the code that makes
the page look the way it does

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.320
is separate from the text, images,
and content that is on the page.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.330
If I add the CSS back, then we're back
to the same Yahoo home page from before.
