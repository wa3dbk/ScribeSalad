00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.823
The last choice is correct. We need both the positive and the negative square

00:00:03.823 --> 00:00:07.639
roots. This time, we don't have any real life situations ruling out negative

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.356
numbers, and it makes sense mathematically that if we end up with a negative

00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:15.368
number inside the parentheses on the left-hand side, since we're squaring it, it

00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:16.907
will equal a positive number.
