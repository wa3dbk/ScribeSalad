00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.500
I was lucky this time that there was nobody in

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.570
the queue when I, when I first came and requested

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.320
the lock. But another time, I may not be that

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.180
lucky. There may be somebody else using the lock already, and

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.370
if that is the case, then what I would have

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.430
to do is to queue myself in this data structure.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.180
And the way to do that, is to indicate by

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.360
setting the last pointer, in this list to point to me.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.810
This pointer is always pointing to the last requestor. In this

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.600
case, the original case that I showed you, I was the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.090
only requestor that was also last requestor. But now, the queue

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.130
has somebody using that particular lock, and so when I come in,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.010
what I'm going to do is, I'm going to set this field of

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.140
the lock data structure, the dummy load, the head node, of the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.906
lock data structure to point to me and the last requester.

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:51.830
And I'm also going to fix up the link list so that the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.200
current guy is going to point to me. Why am i doing

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.350
this? Well, the reason i do this is because when he is

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.990
done using the lock, he needs to reach out and signal me.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.420
What am I going to be doing? I'm going to be spinning. And what

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.230
am I spinning on? I'm spinning on the got-it flag. So this

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.140
is a data structure that is associated with me, and one of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.250
the fields, you know, is the got-it field in the data structure.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.610
So I'm going to spin on this got-it field in the data structure,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.500
waiting for this guy to set it to two. So,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.620
I initialized it to false when I came in, and form

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.690
this request. When I form this request, what I did was

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.990
to set myself as the last requester, I'll clear out this

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.800
field to indicate that I don't have the lock, and I'll

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.630
set up the link list so that the current lock holder

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.970
points to me through his next field. And my next field

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.380
of course, is null because there is no requester after me.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.230
So once I fixed up this, link list and in this fashion,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.350
then I basically can spend on my got it a boolean variable.
