00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We finished the theoretical argument for the security of RSA.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now I'm going to talk about some ways that things can go wrong when RSA is used in practice.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Our security argument assumed that m was a large random number.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What happens if m is small?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Assume n is some large unfactored number.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
RSA-1024 is one of the unsolved RSA challenges.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We'll pick e as 17, and e is often a small number.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It doesn't inherently become insecure when we pick a small e.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The advantage to picking a small e is that it makes encryption fast.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You've intercepted the ciphertext below.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You'll be able to get that number in the Python ID,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so you don't have to try to copy it correctly.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The question is what is m?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Can you determine it from that number?
