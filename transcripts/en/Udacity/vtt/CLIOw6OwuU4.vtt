00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.556
Now that we know that these three intervals are important in some way, I would

00:00:04.556 --> 00:00:09.313
imagine that they each represent or don't represent solutions of x in different

00:00:09.313 --> 00:00:14.094
ways. What I would like to know is whether values within each reasons satisfy or

00:00:14.094 --> 00:00:18.807
don't satisfy the original inequality we had, x squared is greater than 16. So

00:00:18.807 --> 00:00:23.025
for each interval, start out by picking a value for x that lies in that

00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:27.273
interval. And then, secondly, check to see if that value satisfies this

00:00:27.273 --> 00:00:28.096
inequality.
