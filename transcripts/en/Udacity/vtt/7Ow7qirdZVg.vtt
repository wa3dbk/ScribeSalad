00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.490
In this lesson, the objectives are for us to now get a little bit more deeper

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.500
into understanding of how we can do simple image processing and filtering.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.735
One of the things I'll be introducing you to today would be the concept of

00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:15.330
cross-correlation that I've actually already introduced in previous lecture.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.260
But now I'm going to try to define it much more accurately and mathematically.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.880
Using that concept, we will look at the whole concept of convolution and

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.735
the relationship between convolution, and

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:29.920
cross-correlation will also be introduced in this lecture.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.670
I will also describe some of the properties of how these types of methods can be

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.160
used to do filtering types of processes that we won't actually do to be able to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.710
do computer vision and image processing on images.
