00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.868
Noting that x cannot equal negative 4 and x can also not equal 0, since that

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:11.945
would make the denominator 0. Multiply both sides by the denominators, the

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:19.251
quantity 4 plus x and 2x, not forgetting the parentheses. Distribute. Subtract

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:27.281
6x squared and 23x from both sides and simplify. Add 4x to both sides, then

00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:32.711
divide by negative 27. And the answer is 4 over 27.
