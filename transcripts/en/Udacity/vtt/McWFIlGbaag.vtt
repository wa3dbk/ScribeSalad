00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.649
So, thanks Susan. So, how does our body respond to stress? Well, a physiologist

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.245
by the name of Hans Selye studied this, and he discovered that there were in

00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:15.030
fact three distinct phases to the stress response. There's the alarm,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.404
resistance and exhaustion. So, in stage one of the stress response, we have the

00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:25.710
alarm stage. And in this stage, we're exposed to some kind of stress or

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.625
stresser, and our body responds two ways. First, the sympathetic nervous system

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:36.391
releases catecholamines. And secondly the adrenal glands of the of the HPA axis

00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:41.770
releases cortisol. Now and this is our bodies preparation to deal with the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.934
stress. But long term exposure to cortisol compromises our immune function as

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:47.438
we saw with

00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:47.942
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:53.856
Susan. So, our bodies can't handle being in the alarm stage too long. We either

00:00:53.856 --> 00:00:59.605
die or we cope. And if we cope, we enter Stage two, called resistance. And in

00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:04.955
resistance, cortisol is still being released throughout our bodies. And this

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:10.654
cortisol helps activate us, arouses us and maintains a response. Now, long term

00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:15.550
arousal though, is not good for our bodies, as we'll see here more in a minute.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.572
So, in the third and final stage, we have exhaustion. And in the exhaustion

00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:23.348
stage, what's going on is our body's been trying to fight this threat for such

00:01:23.348 --> 00:01:28.519
a long time that we've become depleted of it's resources. And we have no

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:33.018
ability to fight off illness, because our immune system is compromised. In

00:01:33.018 --> 00:01:36.277
fact, I'm sure many of you have gotten sick during finals. That's due to

00:01:36.277 --> 00:01:38.710
exhaustion and lowered immune response.
