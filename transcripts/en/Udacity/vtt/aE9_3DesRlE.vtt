00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.110
And there you have it.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.980
The final lookup yields nothing more interesting than

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.250
the previous calls to the first of the saga functions.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.310
It's as if this second saga function had never been called, or

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.200
at least it doesn't matter whether it has been called or not.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.030
The two operate so much in isolation that it is unimportant whether or

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.160
not other calls to other functions from other contexts ever happened.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.510
Our last call to the saga functions has finished,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.500
the context jumps back out to the global context and

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.480
you've finished everything there is to know about closures.
