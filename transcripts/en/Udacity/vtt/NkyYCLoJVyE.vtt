00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.702
You should have calculated these for your proportions, then you can see that

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:09.411
relative to Canada for example, China has a lot more. You could also see this

00:00:09.423 --> 00:00:14.385
with absolute frequencies, but relative frequencies also give you a sense of how

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:19.044
much of the whole they comprise. If we had include Kyrgyzstan in our example,

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:24.147
Kyrgyzstan would have had a proportion of zero, since 0 of these 50 students are

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:29.425
from Kyrgyzstan. If instead of looking at countries, we had looked at planets,

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.957
we would have found that all of our students are from earth, so earth would have

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.206
a proportion of one. In other words, 50 out of 50 of our students are from earth

00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:46.255
and 50 divided by 50 is 1. This might give you a hint for the next quiz.
