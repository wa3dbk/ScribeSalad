00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.230
I will save the webserver.py file,
navigate to it

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.010
from within my Vagrant machine, and
execute it writing python webserver.py.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.110
The Vagrant environment for this course
is already configured to forward port

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.530
8080 requests from the host machine
to port 8080 on the Vagrant machine.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.780
So if we open up a browser and visit
the URL localhost8080/hello look, our

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.190
server recognized the GET request and
responded with the code that we wrote.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.980
&gt;From the Vagrant machine, we can also
see the GET request it received from

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.970
the browser and
the code we sent as a reply.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.570
Try and create this code on your own.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.560
If you run in to any problems, a
functioning version of this python code,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.820
can be found in the instructor notes.
