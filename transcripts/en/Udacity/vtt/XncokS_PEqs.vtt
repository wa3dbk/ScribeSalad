Now we should take a little break for some self-promotion. Always a good idea.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.592
Now what I mean self-promotion is that name of the first input to a method, the

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:13.900
one that's bound to an object that is created, should always be called self.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.404
There's nothing magic about self. It's just a name, and it's just a convention

00:00:17.404 --> 00:00:22.034
to use that name. And in this case, it's a good idea to follow that convention.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:28.112
Save your creativity for, new code in other ways. So I'll change the name, here

00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:29.093
to be self.
