Alright, let's make this a little bit more challenging. I'm going to show you

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:09.003
some shaded images. And then I want you to write the missing parts of the

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:13.787
fraction. So for example, I know this image has 3/4, or 3 out of 4 pieces

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.508
shaded. This other image has one, two, three, four, five, six out of 8 pieces

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.028
shaded. I know that these two fractions are actually equal. I want to think

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.429
about moving this piece here over into this empty region here, and then my

00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:30.921
figures would match. And really what I did is I doubled the number of shaded

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:35.554
pieces I have. I split up each piece into two parts. Also, I doubled every piece

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:41.230
As I have, because in total I have eight new pieces here so I multiply the total

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:43.495
number of pieces 4 by 2 to get 8
