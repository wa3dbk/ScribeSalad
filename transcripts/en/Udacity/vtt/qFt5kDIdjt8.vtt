00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:02.452
A quick quiz to make sure we're all on the same page.

00:00:02.452 --> 00:00:05.614
At this point in time, our processor is getting faster every generation

00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:07.237
because we're running our transistors faster,

00:00:07.237 --> 00:00:10.639
or instead because we have more transistors available for computation?
