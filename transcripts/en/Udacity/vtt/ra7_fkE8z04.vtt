00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.475
Some of the events that we've listed
suggest that we need to add additional

00:00:06.475 --> 00:00:12.670
state machines, sub-machines, to our
set of concurrently executing machines.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.760
Typically, these correspond
to internal timers.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.320
So you think about it,
the clock radio has some timers in it,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.180
for example, with the snooze button.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.560
You know it has to time ten minutes
before it turns itself off.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.868
And those timers, even though they
aren't directly or explicitly

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:40.280
visible to the user, do effect things
which are visible to the user.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.200
So, we're going to have to model them.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.067
So, the question then arises
as to which ones those are,

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:49.750
how do you come up with
that list of things?

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.100
And one way of doing that
might be to consider events

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.900
eight through eleven which are the
events that correspond to depressing and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.270
releasing the wake and sleep buttons.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.760
So think for a minute about what is
going on when those buttons are pressed,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.850
and presumably, then, the user is also
pressing the hour and minute buttons.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.165
&gt;&gt; And you want me to design another
state machine to represent this?

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:21.730
&gt;&gt; Well,
first think what the radio has to do

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.320
to deal with those things, and
see if that if that doesn't then suggest

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.190
that we need to keep track
of some history somehow, and

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.010
if that then suggests that we need
to have another state machine there.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.150
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.060
So, I think, based on the buttons,
say, none of the buttons are pressed,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.330
talking about the wake button,
and the sleep button.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.520
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; It seems like that needs to be

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.870
represented by some kind of state,
say, nothing, or none, or something.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.570
And based on that state, your other
machines are going to act a certain way.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.660
Like when you press the hour and minute
button, the rest of your state machines

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.260
for adjusting the display and so on and
so forth, will act a certain way.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.160
But then you have a state where
the wake button is pressed, so

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.740
that's it's own state.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.200
And based on it being in that state,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.160
your other machines
will act a certain way.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.415
&gt;&gt; So, while we're pressing that
wake button we are in a state.

00:02:19.415 --> 00:02:20.070
Okay?
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.940
&gt;&gt; And that state then allows
us to press the hour button.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:25.530
Okay?
So,

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.570
pressing that hour button while we we're
in that state has a different effect

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.680
than pressing it when
we're not in that state.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.310
Okay?

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.809
So, let's see what such a state
machine might look like.
