00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:03.617
Here we see the solution to the quiz.

00:00:03.617 --> 00:00:11.256
We have defined three new variables, g0, g1 and g2 for California.

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:14.276
Here we are going to plot the variables.

00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:16.817
Let's first run this code.

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:21.935
Now that the variables are defined, we are going to

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:27.299
first make a plot of g0 and g2 with normed equals 0.

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:31.472
You should see a histogram that looks something like this.

00:00:31.472 --> 00:00:36.478
Now we are going to make the histogram of g0 and g1.

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:40.585
Notice we have now changed normed equals 1.

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:43.487
We expect a normalized histogram.

00:00:43.487 --> 00:00:47.026
Upon running the code, you should see two histograms.

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:49.322
One in red and one in green.

00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:54.110
Notice the values in the y axis have changed.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.360
In these histograms, the area under the curve here or

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.500
the count in each bin summed up must result to one.
