00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.570
So let's have another simple quiz, and we're going to

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.490
have our developer Brett introducing the quiz. And the

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.900
starting point for this quiz is the fact that

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.970
today, quality assurance, or verification, if you wish, is mostly

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.730
testing. That is, testing is the most commonly used

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.550
activity to perform software verification. So now, I'm going to show

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.310
you a quote, 50% of my company employees are

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.691
testers and the rest spends 50% of their time testing,

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:27.347
so I want to ask you, who said

00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:29.664
that? I'm going to give you some possibilities. Was

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:34.215
that Yogi Berra, Steve Jobs, Henry Ford, Bill

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:37.360
Gates or Frank Gehry? Take your best guess.
