00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.790
Let me start this lesson by discussing what is refactoring.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.590
Refactoring is the process of applying transformation or refactoring to a

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.320
program. So as to obtain a refactor program. With an

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.850
improved design but with same functionality as the original program. So

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.520
key aspect of refactoring is the fact that refactoring should

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.150
be somatic to perserving So what is the main goal of

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.030
refactoring? The goal is to keep the program readable, understandable, and

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.260
maintainable as we evolve it. And to do this by eliminating

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.530
small problems soon, so that you can avoid big trouble later. And

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.750
I want to stress once more a key feature of refactoring, which

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.790
is the fact that it is behavior per serving. But how can

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.130
we ensure that the refactoring is behavior per serving? In other words,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.980
how can we ensure that the program does the same thing before

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.560
and after applying a refactoring. So what we would like to do

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.160
is to have some guarantee that, that happens. And unfortunately in general,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.360
there are no guarantees. But something we can do is to test

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.690
the code. For example, we can write tests that exercise the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.390
parts of the program affected by the refactoring, and if we're in

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.430
a [INAUDIBLE] context, we might already have plenty of test cases

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.914
that exercise that part of the code. So we might just have

00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:04.780
to rerun the test cases after the refactoring. And in fact,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.930
that's a very advantageous situation, and that's a very good use of

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.970
existing test cases. And I want to make sure that you remember,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.500
and that you beware that tests provide no guarantees. Testing can only

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.990
show the presence of defects, but cannot demonstrate their absence.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.090
So we can use testing to get confidence in our

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.990
refactorings, but we can't really guarantee that the refactorings are

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.820
behavior preserving. I'd also like to point out that for some

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.100
simple refactoring, we can use a static analysis to actually

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.160
provide these guarantees. And in fact we will see examples of

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.050
such refactorings that are incorporated into IDs and that leverage

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.070
these kinds of analysis to perform refactoring in a safe way.
