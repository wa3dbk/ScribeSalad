00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.930
Let's see if we understood what the problem is with the simple barrier. If we

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.070
have thread zero, that creates a thread one. They both do some work. They use a

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.380
barrier to synchronize, and then immediately after

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.330
that, thread one ends and thread zero is

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.190
the only one that continues. Does the simple

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.460
barrier work for this code: yes, or no?
