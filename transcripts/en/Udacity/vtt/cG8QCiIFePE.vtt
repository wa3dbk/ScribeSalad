00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.270
Now, so far we have only looked at a specific index

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.650
within an image matrix and done all kinds of mathematical operations,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.930
point processes of doing, for example, additions of this one to another one.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.970
So in essence in this one by looking at the index 0 1 2 and 0 1 2.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.140
I'm just looking at this specific pixel and looking at the intensity of that.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.090
What I want to now introduce in this lecture is that we

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.150
can actually expand this.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.840
Not just looking at the one pixel but it's neighborhood.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.220
So here, for example now, is a three by three neighborhood around this pixel.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.490
We can look one, in all directions around this central pixel.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.290
And basically, now we have a small sub-matrix which is

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.140
a three by three sub-matrix.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.250
So how do we actually now start using information, not just at that point but

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.180
around that specific point.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.930
So the question now we're interested in is, how do we smooth the signal?

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.970
Again, an image is represented as a matrix with

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.410
basically the intensity signals now inputted into each and

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.440
every, element, which now I can transverse by looking at the indices i and j.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.010
Now we're interested in saying okay,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.240
I'm going to take this three by three neighborhood and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.480
smooth out the value here with respect to what's happening around it.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.650
To help explain this, let's take this simple example of a 1D Signal.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.680
This is the original 1D Signal and as we traverse through it,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.010
you basically see simplify this, to be one of the rows off a image.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.410
And these are my intensities.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.360
And that's just for simplification just we'll take this as a 1D signal for now.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.760
Our interest in is that I want to be now able to get rid of some of

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.540
the noise in this signal.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.340
Here I'm showing you a smooth version of the signal.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.410
Basically what I've done is now in essence run a process which

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.250
basically looks at different aspects of this image or

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.310
this signal here and says well this is too low.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.240
I need to move this up a little bit based on how I can smooth this curve or

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.050
this whole image that would actually be represented here.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.460
Making assumptions like sometimes I want to do this smoothing because this

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.560
might be an error or actually just want to smooth the signal out.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.900
One of the best ways of doing a simple smoothing of a signal could be that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.670
we can actually just take the average of the neighboring values.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.150
So I could for example look at these four si, four image values and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.200
intensity values and figure out the average of four or

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.990
five of them and replace it in the middle.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.700
So here I'm showing a simple example how would I, I,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.240
I would go about doing an average.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.950
So this would be a moving average, what I'd take is I would take five values and

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.570
basically, sum them and then divide them by five to get the average of the five,

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.300
and replace, this element to have that value.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.920
And I would do this by moving one by one, as I would go down these indices.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.740
Another option would be is not just to do a one by one but actually, or

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.620
just not doing a summation of equal things but change the weights around.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.140
Here is an example of that instance where now I give more weight to the one,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.100
the value that I'm actually changing.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.670
And less weight to the ones in the neighborhood.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.680
So in this instance, I have a flat signal that I'm actually also averaging,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.960
equally giving all neighborhood values equal weight.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.880
And this one, I'm actually giving it a little bit of a ram.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.640
And of course to sum this back and normalize it.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.770
And this one, I had five of them.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.170
I divided by five.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.020
And here the sum is 16, so I divide by 16 to

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.800
be able to normalize the instance back to, the neighborhood that it's in.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.880
And this allows me to do smoothing in different ways and again, these are moving

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.480
averages, and move from one pixel to the other, and start doing this.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.240
And again, I'm showing this in a simple 1D example.
