00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.038
As I mentioned, Spring is a network operating system.

00:00:03.038 --> 00:00:05.980
So, what I described to you just now, is how

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.280
object invocation works within a single node. But these doors

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.170
are confined to the nucleus on a single node. And

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.370
we need to be able to do object invocation

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.980
across the network. The client domain may be over here

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.590
and the server domain may be on a different node

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.760
on the local area network. Object invocation between client and

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.270
server across the network is extended using network

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.240
proxies. For example, on the client box there

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.640
is this Proxy B and on the server box, there is the Proxy A and proxies

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.440
can be potentially different for connecting to different

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.040
servers. So, this client may talk to this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.700
server using this proxy. And may talk to

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.880
a different server, which I'm not showing here using

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.200
a completely different proxy. In other words, the

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.800
proxies can potentially employ different protocols. That's where you

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.360
have the opportunity to specialize. Whether the communication

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.489
that's happening between the client and server is on

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.220
the local area network or on a wide

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.960
area network, and so on. Depending on that, you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.920
can employ the protocol that is appropriate for

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.950
use in the proxy. So, this is a key

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.740
property of building a network operating system in Sun

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.650
where they wanted to make sure that decisions are not

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.640
being ingrained in the operating system of a single

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.310
node, in terms of the connectivity of that node to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.790
other nodes on the network. Depending on where the

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.150
servers for a particular client is going to be maintained,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.860
that is where the location of the server is.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.860
You can employ different protocols to talk between the proxies

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.390
that are on the client machine and the

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.390
server machine. And also the proxies are invisible

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.450
to the client and the server. In other

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.660
words, the client and the servers are unaware whether

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.030
they are both on the same machine or

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.560
on a different machine, and they don't care.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.560
Let's see how this client-server relationship is established

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.984
using these proxies. So when a client-server connection has

00:02:06.984 --> 00:02:10.729
to be made across the network. The first

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.600
thing that happens is, you instantiate a proxy

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.000
on the server node and establish a door

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.970
for communication between the Proxy A and the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.030
server domain through the nucleus on the server

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.440
machine. And now what does Proxy A is

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.700
going to do, is to export a network handle

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.400
embedding this Door X to its peer proxy,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.800
B that is on the client domain. And

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.300
see that this interaction that's going on between Proxy

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.520
A and Proxy B is outside of anything that is in the preview of the nucleus. So

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.150
the network handle that is being established has

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.700
nothing to do with the primitives or the mechanism

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.597
that are available in the nucleus of the Spring

00:02:54.597 --> 00:02:57.830
system. So what proxy is doing, is to create

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.840
a network handle embedding this Door X. And

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.940
it is going to export that to this Proxy B

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.540
and Proxy B has a door that it has

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.840
established locally on Nucleus B so that the client

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.703
domain can communicate with it. And now what Proxy

00:03:14.703 --> 00:03:16.743
B will do, is it will use the network

00:03:16.743 --> 00:03:19.123
handle that has been exported by Proxy A to

00:03:19.123 --> 00:03:22.930
establish a connection between the two nuclei. So this

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.350
network handle and the communication that goes on between

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.810
these two guys is not through the nucleus. That's

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.790
important for you to understand. So now, how does

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.690
the client make an invocation on the server domain?

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.060
Well, when the client wants to make an invocation,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.410
it thinks that when it is accessing Door Y,

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.720
it is accessing the server's domain. But it isn't.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.060
What it is. What it is accessing, is this

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.840
Proxy B and of course access to this Door Y, which is in Proxy B, is blessed by

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.740
Nucleus B, and when this invocation happens, Proxy B then is going to

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.650
communicate through this network handle that it

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.880
has with its peer Proxy A. And the

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.920
peer Proxy A, when it gets this

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.080
client invocation proxied through this Proxy B and

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.590
arriving at Proxy A, will know that oh, this

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.870
is really intended for the server domain. And I know

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.530
how to access that through the door that I

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.400
have in the server domain, and it uses the door

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.140
it has in the server domain in order to

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.240
make the actual invocation. So to recap, what is really

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.570
going on, the client wants to open this Door X.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.194
It doesn't have a direct handle on Door X because

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.114
server domain is in a different node

00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:43.663
of the network. And therefore, the way remote

00:04:43.663 --> 00:04:47.563
invocation is accomplished, is by the server

00:04:47.563 --> 00:04:51.263
domain's door which is the entry point into

00:04:51.263 --> 00:04:57.263
the server domain, is passed on by this proxy via a network handle to its

00:04:57.263 --> 00:05:03.336
peer proxy on a different node, in this case the client node. And once this

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:06.000
network handle is available to Proxy B, it

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.552
can establish the connection between these nuclei, and

00:05:09.552 --> 00:05:13.256
once this connection is established. Then the client

00:05:13.256 --> 00:05:16.638
domain, it thinks it is making an invocation

00:05:16.638 --> 00:05:21.622
call for Door X, but in fact it is being passed through Door Y to this

00:05:21.622 --> 00:05:24.941
proxy. And the Proxy uses a network handle

00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:28.529
to communicate that invocation over to Proxy A

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:32.301
which then uses the actual door that will open the

00:05:32.301 --> 00:05:38.360
invocation call under server domain and execute the client domain's call.
