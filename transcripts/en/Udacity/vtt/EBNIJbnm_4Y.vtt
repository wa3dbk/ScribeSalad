00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.429
The solution set includes negative 3, negative 1, positive 3 and positive 1.

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:12.228
Four separate answers. Great work if you found these four. And keep in mind, we

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:16.450
should have these four answers, since we have a 4 for our highest power. We can

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.019
make the substitution u to equal m squared. We know this since m squared

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.757
squared equals m to the fourth. This let's us have a power of two here and a

00:00:27.757 --> 00:00:33.725
power of 1 here on the us. Next, we factor this quadratic expression to get u

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:38.870
minus 9 times u minus 1. We set each of these factors equal to zero to get u

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.457
equals 9 and u equals positive 1. Now we're ready to go back and find the

00:00:44.457 --> 00:00:48.701
original values for m. We use u equals 9 and u equals 1 from the two solutions

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:54.375
we found from factoring. We know u really equals m squared. So for this u,

00:00:54.375 --> 00:01:00.846
we'll have m squared equals 9 and for this u, we'll have m squared equals 1. We

00:01:00.846 --> 00:01:05.000
want to solve for m, so we take the square root of both sides of the equations.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.712
So here we'll have m equals plus or minus 3 and here we'll have m equal to plus

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:15.402
or minus 1. So we'll have negative 3, positive 3, negative 1 and positive 1 as

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:17.310
our solution set.
