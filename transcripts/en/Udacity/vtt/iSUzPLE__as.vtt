00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.980
We know the values of 4 and negative 3 would make this left-hand side equal to

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.787
0. We can use these two values of x equals 4 and x equals negative 3 to create

00:00:08.787 --> 00:00:14.557
three separate intervals on a number line. These three intervals may contain

00:00:14.557 --> 00:00:19.104
the numbers that are solutions to our quadratic inequality. For example, all of

00:00:19.104 --> 00:00:23.589
the numbers to the left of negative 3 will either make this statement positive

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.870
or negative. We can use a test point within this interval or a test value to

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.360
find out. For example, I could use the value x equals negative 4 to determine

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.280
whether or not this left side is positive or negative. We want this side to be

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.046
greater than 0. So, when I plug in negative 4, I would want this to be a

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:48.193
positive number. If that's the case, then every number from negative 3 and to

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:51.784
the left will make this statement positive, which means we include it in our

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:57.090
solution set. So, rewriting my original inequality here, I can plug in the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.285
value of negative 4 in for x. When we evaluate this, we'll get 8 is greater

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:06.837
than 0. We know the statement is true, so we know all the values less than

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:11.797
negative 3 are solutions to our original inequality. If you're in disbelief

00:01:11.797 --> 00:01:15.030
that all the other numbers in here work, then try plugging in negative 5 or

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.520
something like negative 10 in for the value of x. You should wind up with a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.155
positive number on this side. Here, I've gone ahead and shown you another check

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:28.888
for x equals negative 8. If we use this value at interval I, we'll wind up with

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:33.560
a statement 60 greater than 0. We know this is true, so again, this is part of

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.680
our solution set. We don't need to test every value in interval I, we only

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.518
needed to test one of them. You try testing interval II and interval III. Pick

00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:48.708
one value for x in this region and in this region. Plug them into your original

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:52.800
inequality, and see if you come out with a true statement. If true, then that

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.136
interval is part of the solution. If false, then that interval will not be part

00:01:57.136 --> 00:02:01.410
of our solution. Also, as a hint, think of an easy value to plug in that's

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.013
between negative 3 and positive 4. What do you think is the easiest value to

00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:07.780
use in between these two numbers?
