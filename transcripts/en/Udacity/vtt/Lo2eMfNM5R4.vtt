All right, great. We've completed a table full of information. We have

00:00:04.163 --> 00:00:08.662
information about Janet and information about Rohan. Now, there's one last

00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:14.150
critical piece to this motion problem. And it's right here. We know Janet and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.160
Rohan spend the same amount of time traveling. This means Janet's time has to

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.562
equal Rohan's time. It means that we can set up an equation. So what equation

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:29.110
can we write to solve for Janet's speed? Put that equation here.
