In federated exchange, all patient
data typically stays at the source,

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.750
facilitating provider participation,
but creating technical challenges.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.239
Beginning in 2010, work began
on defining an HIE approach for

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.950
this environment using secure
email over the public internet.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.270
The original used case, with scenarios
around which HIT systems are developed,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.590
was replacing the fax machine as
the way two physicians share data.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.930
