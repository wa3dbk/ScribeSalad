Going through this lesson, there will be some opportunities for quizzes. And

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.390
what I'd like to do is have you consider a simple application that I'm, then,

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.370
going to be asking you questions about. The application involves users and

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.400
a web browser, visiting some kind of website and

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.620
being asked to vote on certain questions. The votes are then submitted and

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.950
the system responds back after registering the vote with some count of how

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.170
other people voted on the same, same question. So the application is web-based,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.940
users are polled on a variety of questions, their choices are recorded,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.220
and there's a display of how others voted. And, in this particular

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.470
situation the actual users remain anonymous as far as the database is concerned.
