00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.030
The diagram is similar to the diagram we just saw,

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.970
except now some of the arrows are going in different direction to indicate when,

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.830
when the various components are being notified about the events that are there.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.430
So now we have four solutions, and we,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.690
we might ask the question why do we need four solutions.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.690
That's an excellent question and it depends upon ultimately how,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.790
how this particular program, this particular solution is going to be used.
