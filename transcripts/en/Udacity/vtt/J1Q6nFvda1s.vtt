00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.030
Now, let's dig a little deeper into the power of abstraction as it applies to

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.270
computer systems. Now, here I'm showing you

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.280
a screenshot of the Google Earth application. Deep

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.410
down in the silicon, you have electrons

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.210
and holes. You may have heard about these

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.320
terminologies or worked with them in a physics 101 course at some point of time.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.750
Let's say that in an application such as Google Earth, you move your mouse

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.620
from Atlanta, Georgia to Chennai, India. When you do that, magic

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.780
happens on the screen. Now, between a user action,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.470
such as moving the mouse from Atlanta, Georgia to Chennai,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.420
India, and the solid state electronics that

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.890
is enshrined in your computer system, there is a whole series of abstractions.
