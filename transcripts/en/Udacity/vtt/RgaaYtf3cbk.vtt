00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.360
Meaningful use is a very important,
highly visible and

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.560
even controversial at times program,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.820
that's divided into the three stages
that phase in over a period of years.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.620
Stage 1 is about data capture and
sharing.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.880
Things like electronically capturing
health information in the standardized

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.350
format, specified by the EHR
certification program.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.729
Stage 2 is about more advanced
clinical processes, but

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:38.730
is similar to Stage 1, just more
ambitious and more sophisticated.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.430
For example, the increased
requirements for E-Prescribing, and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.000
incorporating laboratory tests.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.780
We'll look at that in a moment.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.385
Stage 3 aims for improved clinical
outcomes, which depends on more advanced

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:57.360
EMR functionality, such as clinical
decision support to guide providers.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.440
And tools to help patients become
more involved in their own care.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.970
Stage 3 is ambitious, and has recently
been pushed out to at least 2017.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.960
Today, a majority of providers
participating in meaningful

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.140
use have achieved stage 1, and
are now focused on stage 2,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.531
but only a small percentage
have achieved stage 2, to date.
