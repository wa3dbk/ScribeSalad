00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.810
Let's look at the solution
to our MSI access quiz.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.960
We have two cores with private caches
and MSI coherence, initially block

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.970
access in Memory, which means that it's
really invalid in both of the caches.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.497
After we read X and C1s cache,

00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:21.520
C1s cache with transition this block
from I to S, the shared state.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.500
Because this was a read we
move to the shared state.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.060
Even though it is not really shared,
this is our way of saying basically that

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.570
the block is clean, and
that we only want to read it.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.810
In C2s cache it stay invalid.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.020
When C2 then does a read, it also
gets the block in the shared state.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.740
And if we snoop a read
request in the shared state,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.170
we stay in the shared state.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.250
So finally when C1 writes to X, because
it has a block in the shared state,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.820
it needs to send an invalidation out.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.450
That results in C2 moving
the block to the invalid state.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.130
It can no longer be read until
we get the new copy from C1,

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.520
and C1 after writing has
the block in the modified state.
