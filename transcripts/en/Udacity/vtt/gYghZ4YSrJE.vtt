Lastly we're here to help. When you work in the class you will never be alone.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.870
There is a wiki with lots of useful information about the content of the

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.378
course. There is also a link to the syllabus, or what we call the green sheet,

00:00:10.378 --> 00:00:14.408
that was e-mailed to you. If you can't find something in the wiki, search the

00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:18.963
forum, or add your own question to the forum. I'll be reading the forums, but

00:00:18.963 --> 00:00:23.321
other students will be there to help you as well. When using the forums,

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:28.050
remember not to post working solutions to the problems. If the forum can't help

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.018
you, you can live chat with a Udacity employee, who is, an expert on the course

00:00:32.018 --> 00:00:37.833
content and logistics. You can contact them using the blue rectangle in the

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:42.436
lower-right. Now dive in and enjoy the class. I'm looking forward to working

00:00:42.436 --> 00:00:43.569
and learning with you.
