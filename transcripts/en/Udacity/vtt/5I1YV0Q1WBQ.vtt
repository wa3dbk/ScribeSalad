00:00:00.032 --> 00:00:01.994
So let's summarize how to compact.

00:00:01.994 --> 00:00:06.729
Conceptually, there are 4 steps, though an efficient implementation might combine these into fewer.

00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:10.245
First, we're going to run a predicate on each element of the input.

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:14.462
Then we'll create a scan-in array equal in size to the input.

00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:21.333
For each element of the input, if the predicate is true, put a 1 into the scan-in array. If it's false, put a 0.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:29.077
Then we exclusive sum scan the scan in array. The output of this is scatter addresses for compacted array.

00:00:29.077 --> 00:00:31.711
Now, for the final step--for each element of the input,

00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:35.102
if the predicate is true, then scatter the input element

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:38.770
into the output array, at the address in scan out.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.110
Let's try a little quiz to get some intuition about the run time of compact.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.591
We're going to compare 2 compact operations, and both

00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:51.132
are going to compact the list of numbers from 1 to 1 million.

00:00:51.132 --> 00:00:59.319
Compact operation a--let's say is divisible by 17--is only going to keep a very few of the input items.

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:06.381
Whereas compact operation b--is not divisible by 31--is going to keep most of the input items.

00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:11.721
So for each of the predicate, scan, and scatter faces of the compact operation,

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:16.266
will a run faster, b run faster or will they take the same amount of time?
