00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer to the quiz is 8, and let me show you why that's the case.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We came into the program, the paths fork based on the value of x.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So, now we have two paths at this point.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Assuming that this code doesn't have any paths that we care about,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We now come to another decision point--if y is true with fork execution.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But we also do it on the other path.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So, now we come down here and test on z, 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and we fork again.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This illustrates, in addition to loops, y conditionals make path coverage hard,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
because we get an exponential number of paths on the number of conditional tests.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Of course this is going to be completely impractical but on the other hand

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
it could be that a bug lurks only here. We need path coverage to find a certain bug.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is a valuable weapon to have in our testing arsenal, 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
even if we're not going to be achieving path coverage in practice.
