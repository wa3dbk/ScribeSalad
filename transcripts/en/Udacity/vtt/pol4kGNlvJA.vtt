00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.420
BFS, or breadth-first search,
is actually quite similar.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.250
You're still visiting every edge and
marking off every node.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.110
However, here you search
every edge of one node

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.719
before continuing on through the graph.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.100
Again, we start with the first node and

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.450
mark it as seen,
then visit a node adjacent to it.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.860
Once we mark that node,
we can add it to a queue.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.759
Remember the difference between a queue
and a stack, like we used for DFS.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.970
For a queue, we'll remove
the first element we put in it.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.250
But for a stack, we remove
the most recently added element.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.400
We go back to that first node and

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.930
visit everything adjacent to it, marking
each as seen and adding them to a queue.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.290
When we've run out of edges,
we can just DQ a node from the queue and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.140
use that as our next starting place.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.960
We look at every node
adjacent to that one,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.215
adding each one to the stack until
we've exhausted our options.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.785
It's important to note that when we dequeue,

00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:03.485
we're getting a node adjacent
to the one that we started with.

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:09.625
You can kind of envision a BFS as
creating a tree out of a graph.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:12.665
The node that we started
with becomes the root,

00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:15.589
the group of adjacent nodes is
the next level in the tree.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.230
We need to continue adding
nodes one level at a time.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.260
We finish off one level entirely
before moving on to the next.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.985
And soon, we're done with our BFS.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.880
The efficiency is still the number of
edges plus the number of vertices.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.410
Again, we're visiting every edge and
vertex during our traversal.
