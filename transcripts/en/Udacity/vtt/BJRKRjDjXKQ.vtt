So now that we know how to simplify terms,
we can get back to Grant and his gleaming

00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:07.816
glasses. Earlier, we came up with
expressions for the amount of money that

00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:11.593
Grant's going to make from his friends
buying his wipers, and also from them

00:00:11.605 --> 00:00:15.503
buying his nozzles, and we had an equation
for the total amount of money earned.

00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:19.052
Saying that the total amount of money
he's going to earn from his friends is

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:23.073
equal to the amount that they spent on his
wipers plus the amount that they spent on

00:00:23.073 --> 00:00:28.775
his nozzles. Now I'm going to add one more
equation into the mix for you or rather

00:00:28.787 --> 00:00:32.867
create one more variable. Total money
earned right here takes a long time to

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:40.281
write, so instead I'm going to call this a
different variable. Let's say a. So, with

00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:45.676
my other equations up here, I can also
write total money earned euals a.

00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:50.304
So let's combine all this information that we
came up with in our earlier quizzes and

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:54.587
the new information that I just gave you
that a stands for the total amount of

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:58.385
money earned. Which of these expressions
down here, do you think should replace

00:00:58.397 --> 00:01:03.702
this question mark, in this equation for
a? You can check as many answers as you

00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:07.351
think are right. I know this is a lot to
look at on the screen at one time, but

00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:11.052
once we come up with this final equation,
we'll only have single letters and

00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:14.317
numbers, and no more words, in our
equation, and that will make things much

00:01:14.317 --> 00:01:16.269
easier for the future.
