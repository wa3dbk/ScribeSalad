00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.939
Okay, so let's look at what happens,
I call this Logical Address process.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.832
So we always talk about
physical addresses,

00:00:09.832 --> 00:00:14.680
those are addresses that point
to locations in physical memory.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.878
Locations in address space
are logical its a logical or

00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:23.700
virtual address because it's going to
map to, okay so this mapping that we're

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.200
talking about here, it's going to map
to some physical memory location.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.970
Eventually everything has to
be stored in physical memory.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.890
So we can say logical address 2000
in process one's address space

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.810
is currently lives in physical
location 5000 or something like that.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.460
So process the address space
that we're talking about and

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.710
the addresses that make up that address
space, zero through I said two to the n

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.900
minus one, n is 32 or 64,
these are called logical addresses.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.660
This is in these logical addresses, or
the logical space that we define for

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.600
a process.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.569
The process is going to put it's code,
and it's going to put it's data.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.110
So, when we talk about an address
space as a unit of isolation, so

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.700
that if you start with this
process had its own container

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.550
of memory where it can address different
parts of it in particular different

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.160
locations where it's going to
place its code and data, and

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.070
these are logical, or in case of
virtual memory, virtual addresses.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.450
Eventually, remember the operating
system has to use physical resources

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.250
to implement these abstractions or
virtual resources.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.210
Well address space is a virtual
resource that abstracts memory.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.425
So this address space or
whatever that we have here,

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:46.580
the information that we stored in
this address space, eventually

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.920
we have to use physical memory,
okay, that's RAM or physical memory,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.860
to actually implement this
abstraction we call an address space.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.570
So you enter the logical address,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.840
you say I want to access
logical location 2000.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.100
We have to say well that currently
lives somewhere in this physical memory

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.126
we have here.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:11.520
So this code and data eventually has
to be placed in different places in

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.400
the memory that we have.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.270
This address space has to be backed up,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.110
physically has to be supported with
the physical memory that we have.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.860
And this physical memory could be
multiple processes having their address

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.840
spaces concurrently being or existing
in this physical memory that we have.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.880
So one of the things,
isolation we're talking about is that

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.350
if I'm giving up some physical memory
for address space to do process A, and

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.100
I give some physical memory
to another process B,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.190
it then uses that memory to store some
of its stuff from its address space.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.920
I have to isolate
the two address spaces,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.890
I actually have to isolate both
physical memory can process

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.360
A access versus what physical
memory can process B access.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.420
So the operating system has to do that.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.950
I think isolation, the way to think
about this is when process A is running,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.900
it's adding space is in some
parts of this physical memory,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.405
it should only be able
to go to those parts.

00:03:09.405 --> 00:03:13.080
When process B is running, it should
be able to go to only those parts that

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.490
are currently allocated to it.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.120
And they never run into each other
unless they choose to share,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.170
which is always sort of an exception.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.640
So when you talk about isolation,
think of an address space

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.250
that's what a process thinks it has,
implementing that address space by

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.860
storing pieces of pieces of indifferent
parts of memory, and then making sure

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.810
that the process can only go to
physical memory that belongs to it.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.000
And that's how we get this isolation.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.230
So one of the things we want to do
is how exactly does it work, so

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.300
to get some sense of that.
