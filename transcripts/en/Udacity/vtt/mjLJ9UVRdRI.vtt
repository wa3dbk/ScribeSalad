00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.600
This problem, we going to introduce a new

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.770
graph. The Combination lock. A Combination lock consist

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.630
of a chain through these edges and the edges of a star for the edges in

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.307
red. So, we want to know a function that describes the number of edges given the

00:00:13.307 --> 00:00:17.090
number of nodes is theta of n, theta of n log n, theta of n squared.
