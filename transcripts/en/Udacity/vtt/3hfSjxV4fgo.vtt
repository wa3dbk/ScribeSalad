Exploration-based learning is very common in the real world. You and

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.860
I do it all the time. You need to prop open a door, you bring a chair, and

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.090
you use it to prop open the door because it just put an explanation for

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.470
why the chair, in fact, can prop open a door. There is a sheaf of papers on

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.380
a desk with the shuffling around. You take a coffee mug, put it on the sheaf of

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.000
paper that acts as a paperweight. Another example or explanation best learned.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.800
You and I are constantly dealing with novel situations,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.659
we are constantly coming up with creative solutions to them. How do we do it?

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.280
One way is if we use existing concepts but use them in new ways.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.410
We find new connections between them by building explanations for them. This is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.590
sometimes called Speed Up learning because we're not learning new concepts,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.350
we're simply connecting existing concepts. But it's a very powerful way of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.760
dealing with a large number of situations. And today in class, we'll learn

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.280
how we can build AI agents that can do the same thing that you and I do so well.
