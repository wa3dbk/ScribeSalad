00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.630
If you've been using the simulator
keyboard to test out your version

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.780
of me me,
you may have noticed a little problem.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.041
Especially when editing
this bottom text field.

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:17.118
[NOISE] The keyboard covers up the text
field, and leaves the user stuck.

00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:20.810
One can avoid this by shifting
the entire view up, like so.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.150
To isolate the keyboard issue,
let's build a simple app.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.738
Here I've got an app with
a text field in an image.

00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:30.090
The text field's at the bottom and

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.920
it gets covered up if we
don't shift the view.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.560
Shifting the view a simple.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.100
Remember way back when we built
click counter from scratch in code?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.120
To place our views we
use the frame property.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.378
That's the property we'll use
to shift the main view up.

00:00:43.378 --> 00:00:47.990
More specifically, frame.origin.why.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.740
The point where y = 0 is
at the top of the screen.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.540
To move the view up above the keyboard,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.600
we subtract the height
of the keyboard like so.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.890
But how will we know when
the keyboard is about to slide up?

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.060
This is where NSNotifications come in.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.540
In short, NSNotifications provide a way
to announce information throughout

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.670
a program across classes.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.130
To announce information, like
the keyboard appearing or disappearing.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.250
For more details, see the upcoming text
note on the NSnotification center.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.550
Kind of like we subscribe to mailing
lists, objects have to subscribe to, or

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.990
observe, notifications.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.370
In this block of code,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.280
the view controller is signing up to
be notified when an event is coming up.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.200
The event, UIKeyboard will show.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.430
We'll call the
subscribeToKeyboardNotifications method

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.780
up here, and view will appear.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.330
When the event UIKeyboardWillShow occurs
The method Keyboard Will Show is called

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.770
and that method shifts the frame.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.370
But right now the compiler is
complaining because we haven't

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.180
implemented this get
Keyboard Height method.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.050
Notifications carry information
in the user info dictionary.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.690
The UI keyboard Will Show notification
carries the keyboard frame in

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.880
its user info dictionary.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.000
So that's how we get
the keyboard height.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.139
So now let's see this
keyboard shift in action.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.250
But let's not forget,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.770
just like with mailing lists
eventually we need to unsubscribe.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.730
So here's the method to unsubscribe
from keyboard notifications.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.010
And we'll call this unsubscribe method
up here in view will disappear.
