00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
Welcome to networking. I'm Nick and I'll be your teacher in this course.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.910
&gt;&gt; And I'm Josh. Nick and I have prepared

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.460
a set of fun projects for you to tackle.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.120
&gt;&gt; We have an awesome course prepared for you. We'll be covering advanced

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.410
concepts in networking. Such as software defined

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.400
networking, data center networking and content distribution.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.650
&gt;&gt; You'll complete projects using a state

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.840
of the art network emulator called mini-net to

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.700
understand and explore these advanced concepts. Leading up

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.500
to a final project replicating actual networking research.
