00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.929
Hopefully you were able to type this expression into MathQuill properly. But

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.162
just in case it's giving you trouble, here are the keys you need to press to

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:11.205
make it happen. To write log base 3 of x plus 4, we use something pretty

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:16.970
similar to what we did up here. You type \ log and then space to type the word

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.036
log. To move down to type the 3 as a subscript, hold down Shift while you press

00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:26.656
the button with the minus sign. Then you can enter your 3 and move back up

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:31.840
here, press the Right Arrow key. They may need a parenthesis, an opening one.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.578
And then we have our input, x plus 4. Of course, MathQuill closes this

00:00:35.578 --> 00:00:39.476
parenthesis for you on its own. So you don't have to technically type another

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:43.759
one, although you can if you want to. As I said before, you'll get a ton of

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:47.739
practice typing in things like this in MathQuill in future lessons.
