00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.550
Once we have identified Independently Testable Features, the next step is to

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.720
identify the Relevant Inputs for each one of these features. And there are

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.420
many ways to do that. So, what we're going to do, instead of

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.770
looking at them all, is that we're just going to focus on two different

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.239
ways of doing it. And they are fairly general ways. So, they

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.910
are applicable to a number of situations. And in addition, what I will

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.190
do, I will point you to other sources in which you can

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.530
look at different ways of doing this in the class notes. The problem

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.390
of identifying relevant inputs for some Software or some feature

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.930
of it is called Test Data Selection and can be expressed

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.040
as followed. Let's consider our software as usual we have

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.190
our Input Domain, which is the set of inputs for all

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.980
the software. And again as usual, we have our Output

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.050
Domain, which is the set of corresponding outlets for these inputs.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.450
So the question here is, how can we select a meaningful

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.920
set of inputs in my domain? And of course corresponding outputs

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.240
because we know that test cases are an input, plus an

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.900
expected output. So how can we select interesting inputs for our

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.040
software? So a set of inputs that, after we run them

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.950
on the software, if the software behaves correctly, we'll have enough

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.060
confidence that the software is correctly implemented. So one possible idea

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.830
is, hey, why don't we just test them all? We just

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.800
do exhaustive testing. We do all the inputs, nowadays we have

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.290
powerful machines, we have a lot of computational power in the cloud.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.890
Why not just doing it? So to answer that

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.480
question, what I'm going to do? I'm going to use another quiz.
