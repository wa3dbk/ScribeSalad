00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We're going to use regular expressions,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which are very good at specifying sets of strings

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to specify tokens.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Later on we'll want to match a bunch of different tokens

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
from webpages or JavaScript, and this is how we write out

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
token definitions in Python.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The t_ tells us--and it tells the Python system--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that we're declaring a token.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The next letters are the name of the token.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You either get to make this up yourself, or in the homework

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'll tell you what I want it to be.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Tokens are in some sense going to be functions of the text they match.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
More on this a bit later.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Skip me for now.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Next, we have a regular expression

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
corresponding to this token,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
which in this case, for the right angle token,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
there's really only 1 string it can correspond to,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
so we've written out the regular expression that corresponds to a single string.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And then here on the last line we're returning the text of the token unchanged.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We could transform it, and you'll see us do that for more complicated tokens

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
like numbers where maybe we'll want to change the string 1.2

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
into the number 1.2.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Now it's your chance to define your first token.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What I would like you to do is write code

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in the style of the procedure I just showed you before

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
for the LANGLESLASH token.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The LANGLESLASH token is surprisingly important.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We really need it to know when all of our tags end.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Use the interpreter to define a procedure

00:01:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
t_LANGLESLASH that matches it.
