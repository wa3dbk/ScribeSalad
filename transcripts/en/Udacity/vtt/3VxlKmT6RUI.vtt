00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.060
There are some important considerations I want to make on final state

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.410
machines. And more in general, on model based testing. The first one

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.600
is about applicability. Testing based on final state machines is a very

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.890
general approach, that we can apply in a number of contexts. And in

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.510
particular, if you are working with UML, you have state machines for

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.720
free. Because state charts are nothing else but a special kind of

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.210
state machine. So you can apply the technique that we just saw

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.010
directly on state charts, and try to cover their states and their transitions.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.980
Another important point is that abstraction is key. You have to find the

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.280
right level of abstraction. The bigger the system, the more you have to

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.130
abstract if you want to represent it with a model, and in particular, with

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.710
the final state machine. So it's like having a slider, and you have

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.840
to decide where you want to move on that slider. The more you represent,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.700
the more complex your system is going to be and the more thorough your

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.110
testing is going to be but also more expensive. The less you represent the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.330
less expensive testing is going to be, but also testing might not be as

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.500
thorough as it would be otherwise. So you have to find

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.150
the right balance between abstracting the weight too much and abstracting

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.840
the weight too little. And finally there are many other approaches.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.840
So we just scratched the surface, and we just saw one possible

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.760
approach. But for instance, other models that you can use are

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.780
decision tables, flow graphs and even historical models. Models that can

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.560
guide your testing based on problems that occurred in your system

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.500
in the past. And also, in this case, I'm going to put pointers

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.460
to additional materials in the class notes.
