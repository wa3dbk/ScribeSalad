00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.570
We now have some context around how the location of

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.040
a World Cup affected its attendance, but since we overlaid circles for

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.500
all the years at once, the context of time has gotten lost.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.540
Or rather, we have sacrificed time for space, or geography in this case.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.550
As we saw with our previous plots and charts, there's quite a big dependence of

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.530
the total attendance of a World Cup with the year it was held, with the trend

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.450
being as time went on, World Cup attendance has steadily increased.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.940
One way to get the best of both worlds, geography and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.700
time, is to leverage animation to encode the passage of time.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.510
Remember previously that we mentioned animation can be thought of something

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.020
of another visual encoding that helps convey the change of some data over time.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.390
I wanted to take a step back also so

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.070
that we can remember where we are in the process.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.820
We will be creating a drill down story following the martini glass narrative

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.050
structure, but

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.090
currently we only have a static map that represents the base of our glass.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.950
While this is a great foundation and starting point for

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.820
what we will be building, we still need to construct the stem of our glass,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.990
as well as the mouth of our glass.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.610
We will now begin building up the stem of our glass,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.080
through an author driven narrative with animation.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.980
And we will finish the mouth of our glass,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.570
with a reader driven narrative, enabled through interaction, and

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.470
remember, we're at our starting point with our base map.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.790
We'll be narrowly guiding the reader with our author driven narrative, and

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.400
then allow them to open up and

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.780
explore their own narrative through interaction in the mouth of the glass
