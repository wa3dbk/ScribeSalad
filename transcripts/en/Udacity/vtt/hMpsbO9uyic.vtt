00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.945
Now, I think we're at a point where we can really help Grant solve this

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:08.386
inequality. We have the quantity 15 plus x times the quantity 20 plus x, less

00:00:08.386 --> 00:00:12.796
than or equal to 750 to describe how the expanded side links of his booth area

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:17.136
will determine a total area that needs to be less than or equal to 750 square

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:21.561
feet. What I'd like you to do know is do a little bit of algebra. To get this in

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:25.563
a quality in a form so that we can have 0 on the right hand side and then an

00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:29.910
expression on the left hand side, so I would like you to start out actually by

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.257
simplifying the expression on the left and then getting rid of the 750 on the

00:00:34.257 --> 00:00:38.673
right side, in other words, I'd like you to simplify the left-hand side of the

00:00:38.673 --> 00:00:40.510
inequality as much as you can.
