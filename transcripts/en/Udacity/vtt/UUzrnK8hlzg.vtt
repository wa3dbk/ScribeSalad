00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.590
For the final project in this course,
you're going to build databased backed

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.740
software to run a particular kind
of game or sporting tournament.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.220
In a Swiss style game tournament,
players aren't eliminated when they

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.390
lose a match, every player,
gets to play in every round.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.590
And in each round,
each player plays against someone with

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.660
about the same number of wins and losses
that they have, which means that each

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.720
player is likely to be matched against
an opponent with about equal strength.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.890
Ties are broken by looking at how well
the tied players' opponents have done.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.280
After all beating two
strong opponents counts for

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.940
more than beating two weak opponents.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.880
This system was invented in Zurich,
Switzerland in 1895 for chess.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.170
But it is now used for a wide variety
of games and sports around the world.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.650
And keeping track of such a complicated
tournament is a good job for a database.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.380
In this lesson,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.760
you'll be writing a python module
that uses the PSQL database,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.830
to pair up players in each round of
a tournament and record their results.
