00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.917
Yes, a thread block contains many threads,

00:00:02.917 --> 00:00:06.650
and it's also true that an SM might run more than one block.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.386
On the other hand, a thread block may not run on more than one SM.

00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:11.948
By definition, a thread block is run on a single SM.

00:00:11.948 --> 00:00:15.995
Now, all the threads in a thread block may cooperate to solve a subproblem.

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:17.795
That's why we have thread blocks.

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:22.125
This last one is false, and it's a bit subtle so let me talk it through.

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:27.430
The key, as I said, all the threads that run on a given SM may cooperate to solve a subproblem,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.398
but in fact you might have multiple thread blocks on an SM,

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:36.455
and by definition threads and different thread blocks should not attempt to cooperate with each other.

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:39.422
And that's why this statement is not the same as the one before it.
