00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.560
Like any complex new feature,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.530
it's pretty easy to shoot
yourself in the foot.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.570
If you don't handle the edge cases
properly, you can find yourself with

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.990
an app that might never update because
the service worker never updates.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.960
It's crucial that the HTTP request made
during the install event goes directly

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.280
to the network, and doesn't return
a response from the browser's cache.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.840
Otherwise, the browser may return
the old cached version resulting in

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.270
a service worker cache that
never actually updates.
