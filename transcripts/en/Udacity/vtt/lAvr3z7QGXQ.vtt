Here's how we will proceed. The following slide contains a textual descriptions

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.130
of the functions of a coffee maker. It is followed by a description of the API

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.540
to control the coffee maker. Your initial task will be to use the API and

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.130
the textual analysis technique, we used at the start of the semester. To design

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.010
a set of OO classes to control the coffee maker. You're going to express your

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.070
answer in the form of a UML class model diagram describing your design.
