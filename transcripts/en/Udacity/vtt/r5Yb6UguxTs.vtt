00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.948
I'll start with .append and

00:00:01.948 --> 00:00:06.630
.prepend, which you might remember from the Javascript Basics resume project.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.970
These add children to an element.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.338
So, if I select this DOM element of the firstArticleItem, I can call .append or

00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:21.255
.prepend, and this new element will be added as a child to this one.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:26.940
.append adds this new element as the last child of the selected item,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.280
while .prepend adds this new element as the first child of the selected item.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.700
When we test this code, we can see some cute puppies at the beginning of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.830
Article 1 and at the end of Article 1.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.540
But what if I wanted this element to have a sibling?

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.170
For that, I'll use .insertBefore or .insertAfter.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.960
As you may guess, .insertBefore adds a sibling before the current element, and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.740
.insertAfter adds a sibling after the current element.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.430
You know what?

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.380
Why don't you give these a try?
