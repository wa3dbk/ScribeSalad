00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.380
Well, I've typed this in and all I need to do is hit enter to find out what the

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.247
answer is. And we get a value of 9. This makes perfect sense. You know that 7

00:00:11.247 --> 00:00:15.126
plus 2 is 9. Now, we can try this with other values too. Let's play around. I

00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:23.314
could do increase by 2 of 25, let's say. That gives us 27. I could do increase

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:29.890
by 2 of negative 17. This time let's make an interesting number like 0.9886.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.774
That gives us 2.9886. Awesome. So, hopefully this is giving you another way at

00:00:35.774 --> 00:00:40.100
how functions work. We have three clearly defined things involved in this

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.799
program right here. We have the input. The function, which is processing this

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.683
input. And then the output that the function spits out.
