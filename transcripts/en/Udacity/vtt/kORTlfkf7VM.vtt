00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.288
So in the last lesson, we saw that UIKit contains many visual items like

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:09.330
buttons and labels.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.140
Now, inside UIKit are several other classes that help us

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.170
manage these visual elements.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.950
One of them is called UIVewController.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.930
This class helps us manage a view,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.260
especially its life-cycle events like viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear, etc.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.740
You may recall that we created a class called ViewController,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.005
which inherits from UIViewController.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.090
Then we use something called UINavigationController.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.780
This class helps us navigate hierarchical content in our apps,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.530
which is just a fancy way of saying it allows us to move from one screen of

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.480
the app to another screen.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.410
Now, there are a few links in the instructor notes that will give you a list of

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.700
all the classes that are inside UIKit and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.870
the relationships between those classes.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.740
This includes an image that lists out all the classes and

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.890
how they are connected to each other.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.360
I recommend that you browse through them now.
