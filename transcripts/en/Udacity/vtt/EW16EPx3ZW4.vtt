00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.030
So you're going to need to update the save profile

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.020
method in the Conference API class so that, see here where

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.860
we get the profile, every time we get the profile

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.780
we create new one. Instead of doing that what we need

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.180
to do is check if the profile's already in the

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.250
data store if it is, get it out, if it isn't

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.310
create a new one and then set the values all passed

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.390
in by the form. The values that the form doesn't pass

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.800
in for new entity, use the default

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.930
values and if the entity already existed, then

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.720
leave the existing values in the properties. You're also going to need to add a

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.960
method in the profile class called update

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.015
profile that takes a display name and the

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:44.700
t-shirt size and updates them. If they

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.320
haven't changed. That is if they aren't now.
