00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.220
Okay, so I talked about memory,
I talked about isolation.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.630
Transferring control
from user to OS part of

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.020
the system that we have, a memory
where OS coordinator structure is.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.330
We want to sort of dig deeper into it
and really think about how do we define

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.480
what data and code a certain process or
application can access.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.110
I said one of the jobs the operating
system has is give you high level

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.490
obstructions.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.705
Okay, so we don't talked about
particular memory location that we

00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:33.900
happen to have right now.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.490
With each process we said sort
of can believe as if it has

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.230
the whole computer to itself.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.130
In particular, each process wants
to feel that it has the memory

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.020
that it needs, where its data and
code is going to go, it has to itself.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.370
And actually, each process does have
something of that sort for itself, and

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.340
that's called an Address Space.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.337
Address Space is sort of a container.

00:00:56.337 --> 00:01:00.377
It's a sequence of memory locations.

00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:04.018
It's a collection,
which is a sequence of memory locations,

00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:08.483
that define a collection of those memory
locations, it defines a space, and

00:01:08.483 --> 00:01:13.695
each of this location can be address so
that's what makes it an address space.

00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:18.635
because each process has an abstraction
of memory that is an Address Space,

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:22.960
an Address Space actually is going
to be a unit of isolation, so

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.980
when we talked about isolation.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.730
Now we're talking about sort of
isolate what from what else, and

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.300
we're going to talk about
isolating Address Space.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.160
Address Space completely defines
the data and code that is there for

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.880
a given application.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.600
The data and code is going to reside
in the bunch of memory locations and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.880
those memory locations together
make up an Address Space

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.830
that belongs to a particular process or
application.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.780
So that's why we have to sort
of [INAUDIBLE] solation.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.728
We have to dig deeper a little bit and
think about the Address Spaces.

00:01:54.728 --> 00:01:59.080
So if a processes essentially going to
think that it has the memory to itself,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.070
it's going to think of this memory as
a contiguous set of locations going from

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.060
some starting address zero to some max.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.389
And it's going to think that it
has this set of memory locations,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.330
not only the contiguous, but they could
even be more than the total memory

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.540
that we have, physical memory
that we have in a computer.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.330
If you done your operating systems
class, you heard about virtual memory,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.920
which most operating systems
actually support virtual memory.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.994
That could be more than
the physical memory that we have.

00:02:29.994 --> 00:02:32.658
Address Space that we're talking about,

00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:36.361
when a process is a contiguous
container of memory, okay?

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:37.826
That can be addressed,

00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:42.662
which is going from zero to some maximum
address that we can have and it doesn't

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:47.800
have to be constrained by the physical
amount of physical memory that we have.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.980
So the address space actually usually,
it it's a 32-bit architecture,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.910
basically means addresses in
that case are 32-bit long.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.180
Or it could be 64-bit architecture.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.680
In that case they'll be 64-bit long.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.310
They go typically form zero through two
to the third minus to minus one, or

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.890
two to the 64 minus one.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.700
Your addresses and number bits, and
based on that you can have two to

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.740
the n different locations that you can
address with that size of an address.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.530
We said that Address Space
is a contender for

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.540
anything that has to be stored
in memory for a process.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.340
Remember, process has to
fetch instruction data,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.550
so that information has to be in
memory before we can execute it.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.680
So we have to prepare
an Address Space for

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.480
a process before it starts execution.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.040
And we tell the process,
here is an Address Space for

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.190
you, you can address the location
zero through something, and

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.620
you decide to put your data and
code in these locations.
