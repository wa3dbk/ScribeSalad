00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.060
So far we've been looking at cameras but we've been actually looking at

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.470
the details of the optics, that is how light enters through the optics.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.510
And of course at the back,

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.810
at the focal lens of the camera where the image is formed.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.160
Now let's talk about how to save the image.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.890
In this kind of camera, a film camera, a film is placed here and

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.040
it's the chemical process of the film that takes the light and preserves it.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.800
By changing the chemistry on the film and that is stored to create prints.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.740
And this lesson will talk about the composition of the film itself.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.399
But also, since we are actually moving to the world of digital photography we'll

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.735
talk about the composition.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:41.591
And how something like a CCD, a charge couple device, is used to save

00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:46.975
information in an electronic form or electrical energy form, from light.

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:49.462
We'll also discuss concepts of bare filtering,

00:00:49.462 --> 00:00:52.000
that allow us to talk about different colors.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.620
And also a CMOS sensor, which is the one that's widely in use for

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.160
all the cameras that we actually currently use these days.
