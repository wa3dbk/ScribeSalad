Yeah, so I was physics major in college and

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.830
then I was physics major in grad school. And I

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.590
continued on to get my PhD in physics. But what

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.840
I found during my PhD is that I, I really

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.910
love doing data analysis, and that my real passion

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.860
was for sort of trying to understand the world through

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.290
data. And I wanted to find a job where I

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.180
could have a big impact and really make a difference.
