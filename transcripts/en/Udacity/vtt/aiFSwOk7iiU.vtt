00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So far I've told you that mutation

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
modifies the existing object.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But you can't really see the difference from what we've done with strings.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Where we'll really see the difference is when we introduce a new variable.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's go back to the example we had before,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and now we're going to add an extra assignment statement,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we'll introduce a new variable.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Suppose we introduce the variable "q."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And we assign p to q, and that means the value of p,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which is the object that's this list,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is now what q will refer to.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The important thing here is after the assignment,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
p and q refer to the same list.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Suppose we did an assignment statement

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
to modify the value of one of the elements of q.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Well, that will change element 4 of q,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so this is element 4 of q.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It will change that value

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to the new exclamation point.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It also changed the value of p.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Even though the assignment statement didn't include p,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
the fact that p and q refer to the same object

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
means that it changed the value of p.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
To show you that things are different with strings,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
let's try that with a string.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
See if you can guess what happens when we try to use assignment

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to replace the first letter in the string.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Let's run it to see what happens.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And what we get is an error,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and we get an error because the string is not mutable.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
There's no way to change the value of the string,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and the error says there's no way to do assignment in a string,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that that type of object, because it's immutable, does not support assignment.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
A key difference between mutable objects and immutable objects

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is once an object is mutable,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
then we have to worry about other variables that might refer to the same object.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We can change the value of that object,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and it affects not just the variable that we think we changed,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
it affects the value of other variables as well.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Let's see an example of that.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I've initialized p to the list containing the strings "Hello."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now I have an assignment that introduces the new variable q

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and assigns p to that variable.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And we'll print out the values of p and q,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and we'll see that both p and q contain the string Hello.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But now let's change the value at position 0.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Now we have an assignment that stores

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
in the value at position 0 of p the letter y.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
This changes the value of p.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
What may be more surprising is this also changes the value of q.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Even though we didn't use q in the assignment,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
it changed the value of q because q

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
refers to the same object as p.
