00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.630
So, now that we have seen multiple
aspects of how caches work,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.450
let's summarize them for
a more realistic cache.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.763
Let's say we have a 4kB,
4-way set associate cache with a 64-byte

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:19.160
line size with a write-back and
write-allocate write policies.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.630
The processor, let's say, creates
64-bit addresses to access the cache.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.800
When accessing this cache,
the 64-bit address will

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.040
be divided into offset bits,
index bits and tag bits.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.940
First for
offset bits it's a 64-byte line, so

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.880
we need 6 bits, bits 0 through 5,
there are 6 of them.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.150
Are going to tell us where
in the cache block we are.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.570
Next we need to determine how
many sets this cache has.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.020
It's a four kilobyte cache,
that's two to the 12th bytes.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.430
The number of blocks
is that divided by 64.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.220
Which is two to the sixth.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.285
So we have two to the sixth
blocks in the cache.

00:01:06.468 --> 00:01:09.970
It's a four-way set associative
cache which means that

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.140
every set has four blocks in it.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.240
So we divide the number of blocks with
the number of blocks in a set and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.030
we get two to the fourth, or 16 sets.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.140
Now we know that we need four bits
to tell us which set we are in, so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.150
bits six, seven, eight, and nine,
four of them are the index.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.740
The bits that remain, bits 10
through 63, 54 of them are the tag.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.100
Now, in our cache,
we will have for each block.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.818
A valid bit.

00:01:45.818 --> 00:01:51.310
It's a write-back cache, so
you also have a dirty bit.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.520
Then there will be a tag, 54 bits.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.290
It's a 4-way set-associative cache, so
we need to pick a replacement policy.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.810
Let's say the replacement policy is LRU.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.956
For a 4-way set-associative cache,

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:08.008
each block needs to have
a two bit LRU counter.

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:15.550
Here we have one, one, 54, two, and then
we have 64 bytes' worth of actual data.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.310
As you can see we have 58
bytes in addition to the data.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.560
So there is some overhead.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.110
The cache size is usually expressed in
terms of how much data it contains.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.360
But the actual size of the cache
array is larger because it needs to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.230
contain all of these extra bits for
each line of data.
