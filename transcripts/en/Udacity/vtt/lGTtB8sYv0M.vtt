00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here's the original code--I remembered adding an s_ at the beginning to distinguish it

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
from the union procedure that we want as the result.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now to find union to use s_union to get the union of a and b, and then I go through

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the elements in that result adding the ones that aren't already in a to the value of a.
