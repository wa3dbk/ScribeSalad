00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.495
This perfect square trinomial is really a binomial squared. Our a is really 3c,

00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:11.742
since the quantity 3c squared equals 9c squared. Our b term is really 2d. We

00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:17.140
know 2d squared equals 4d squared. So this is a perfect square trinomial. And we

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.905
can factor it as a minus b squared. So we have 3c minus 2d squared.
