00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's our age distribution again and they come at certain frequencies.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Two of the people in the database are 19 years old, one is 20, one is 21,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
three at 22 and so on--there's 11 individuals.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
When I ask you the obvious question now--give me the lower quartile,

00:00:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
the median and the upper quartile in these three boxes over here.
