So I'm going to give you a hypothetical example, and ask you to tell me the

00:00:05.052 --> 00:00:10.226
mode. Most people live to be about 60 or more. So let's say that this is 60

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:15.797
here. But unfortunately, some people reach the end of their time when they're

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:21.353
younger. So where would you say the mode is? Would you say it's here, here, at

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:22.460
60? Or up here?
