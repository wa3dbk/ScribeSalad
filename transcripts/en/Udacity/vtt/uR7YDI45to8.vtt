00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.170
Okay, let's look at these questions.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.040
So, the new algorithm on average, check fewer assignments than the original?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.530
This is actually true and to see this the area all you have to look at is

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.630
the original has to check every possible assignment.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.960
If it doesn't, then it can't know that it's actually the lowest assignment

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.200
whereas the new algorithm, as soon as it finds a vertex cover that works,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.040
since it starts from the bottom, it knows that that is the minimum vertex cover,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.210
so it knows that it can be done, so on the average,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.550
the new algorithm will actually check fewer assignments than the original.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.380
Now does the original algorithm sometimes look through fewer assignments?

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.510
This is actually false and again, the same reasoning applies.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.720
The original algorithm has to look through every possible assignment,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.950
whereas the new algorithm sometimes doesn't.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.220
Now is the worst-case behavior of the new algorithm, in O-notation better than the original?

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.820
This is actually false and to see this, you just have to realize that

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.220
sometimes the new algorithm is still going to have to check through every possible assignment.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.560
Sometimes that's the best minimum vertex cover you can hope to find

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.870
and since that's the worst case and it's the same as new algorithm,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.560
the worst case behavior in O-notation is also just as bad as the original.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.200
However, the best case behavior is actually better than the original algorithm.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.350
The new algorithm does better in the best case.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.830
The best case is that there happens to be a minimum vertex cover

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.030
of only one vertex and it checks that first.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.470
And if it does, well then it's done whereas the best case of the original algorithm is still exponential

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.630
because it has to check every possible assignment, so the best case behavior is far better.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.140
Now what about the average-case, how can we expect the new algorithm to behave on average?

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:03.140
Well actually, the new algorithm isn't on average as synthetically better than the original algorithm.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.889
Again because it may have to check through just as many assignments as the original algorithm.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:14.240
Now, this last question is tricky. How about the average-case behavior in the algorithm?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.780
Compared to the original, is it better as synthetically?

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.200
This is actually false and this might be a little hard to see

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.420
but a good way of looking at it is to realize that on average,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.970
the new algorithm is still going to have to check through

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.100
at least half of the possible vertex cover of all the possible assignments.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.880
And there are exponentially many different assignments to the graph.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.590
Well, half of the exponential number of assignments is still exponential,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.180
so on average, the behavior of the new algorithm is still exponential which is just as bad as the original.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.280
So, if you got that, great. If you didn't, don't worry.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.020
That's kind of a tricky question but hopefully I got you thinking.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.890
So if you have trouble with any of these, don't worry about it.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.250
Some of them were a little bit tricky but hopefully they got you thinking.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.380
Okay, that's it for this problem set. Hope to see you in the next unit.
