Alright, this is great. Now, we have Janet's distance and rate, and Rohan's

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:08.616
distance and rate. We just need to find expressions for time for Janet and for

00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:13.909
Rohan. We know that distance equals rate times time. That was the problem we

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.270
saw at the beginning of this lesson. And in fact, we saw that we could take

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.828
this equation and manipulate it to have these other equations. So if we want to

00:00:22.828 --> 00:00:27.930
find the time, we can simply divide the distance by the rate. This is what

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.807
we're going to use in our problem. Knowing this, I want you to use this

00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:35.965
information in the table to find an expression for Janet's time and for Rohan's

00:00:35.965 --> 00:00:37.750
time.
