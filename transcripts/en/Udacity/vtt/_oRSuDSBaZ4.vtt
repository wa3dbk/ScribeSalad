00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.506
The first step is to pull a factor of 10 out from each term. So, that gives us

00:00:04.506 --> 00:00:08.970
10 times x squared minus 3x minus 4. All we need to do now is factor what's

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.988
inside the parentheses here. When we do that, we get 10 times x minus 4 times x

00:00:13.988 --> 00:00:17.749
plus 1. Great, we are fully factored.
